False,2021-04-20 12:43:19,3,Maybe I don't know how to use this app?,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this app. While it does ask you questions/give you prompts to get you talking about things, sometimes the questions are weird. I had one this morning, somewhere along the lines of ""what are you then, a mere body? a ration being."" And I'm staring at my screen like how do I even answer this if I don't understand the question? There's other ones that are similar and because I don't understand what it's asking me to write, sometimes I'll just put ""lol"" so I can move to the next page. Then when you're done with your questions it will ask if you feel better and mostly my answer has been no because the questions it gave me were weird. You can pick what questions you'd like to be asked everyday but none of them really jump out to me as something I'd want to answer daily besides the one sentence summary of your day but even that is whatever. I do like that it tracks your mood, would be cool to have another tracker for what is causing your mood instead of the sad to happy face scale. The quotes are cool too. I've been using the app for about 2 weeks now and I feel like maybe twice out of the 14 days, it's actually asked me something relevant. More often than not, I'm using the blank page entries instead but I could just write those in my actual journal. Perhaps this app isn't for me, but it seems to work for people.",Jay2DaNaay,stoic,1312926037,
False,2021-04-03 14:27:52,5,yuhhhhhh,"I downloaded this app last week and it‚Äôs been on my home page since then. I‚Äôve only started using this app a few days ago and OMGüò≥ This app is so beautiful. I‚Äôm only writing a review just so I can ask if you guys can put a password for the journal part because my mom looks through my phone and I don‚Äôt want her to read the things I write in thereüíÄ Anyways, I do actually really love this app and its perfect from the bottom of those codes and to the top of the icon. It‚Äôs iconic honestly. Not to forget the fact that it‚Äôs been lifting burdens and weights off of my back when I type everything in details. It‚Äôs like a friend that I‚Äôve always wanted, which is sad because none of my real (alive) friends are there for me and asks me how I am like how stoic isü•≤ Ever since the app asked me the first question, I‚Äôve poured allllll of the things I wanted to say and in details too. I- this app is like that one friend that you have that‚Äôs always there for you no matter what and genuinely cares for you so deeply and that you‚Äôre comfortable being around them even though you‚Äôve only met last week. yknow? this app is my twin flame.",kytedot,stoic,1312926037,
False,2021-01-25 20:15:12,5,Absolutely Incredible - Better than Others,"Absolutely incredible. The focus breathing, the journaling, and the adaptability to each user. I have never seen such an app before. I have downloaded over 20 journaling apps, but I eventually always delete the app because I forget to journal because the app doesn‚Äôt help me. Now, this journaling app is incredible. I write 3-5 times a day and use its focus breathing exercises so much. This is the only app I want to actually support with money even though I am a stingy person.

Update: I do dislike the new feature where it asks you to think negatively to become grateful without being able to decline like last update. For those who are suffering depression, anxiety, and other mental issues, this is a big black hole that one can go into. I plead the developers to lock this feature away by being able to decline before the app asks you that question.",NemoTheCat,stoic,1312926037,"{'id': 20686361, 'body': 'hey,\n\ncould you please ping me at m@stoicroutine.com so we could find the issue with forcing negative visualization? \n\nthere should be an option to skip it but i worry we messed it up.\n\nbest,\nmaciej', 'modified': '2021-01-27T12:52:23Z'}"
False,2021-04-20 16:20:19,5,This is the app I needed.,"This is the app I needed. I‚Äôve been looking for this for a long time.  What I‚Äôm here to treat: Bipolar Disorder 1, ADD, Anxiety and Relationship problems.

Why I have failed with past apps and what this one gets right

1) Clutter/Non-optimal design

Due to my extreme sensitivity and need for minimalism, other apps with their colors and complex menus were usually too much.

This one is white one black. Perfect.
Journal history view is scroll-only with effective use of emoji to efficiently encode the information. Perfect.

2) Need multiple apps

By way of illustration, prior to finding this app, I was using and paying for multiple apps featuring breathing exercises and CBT, to name a couple. A dedicated breathing exercise app may still be desirable for you, but if you‚Äôre easily overwhelmed such that the prospect of needing multiple apps will increase your chances of failure, know that this app contains breathing exercises and guided meditations alongside the best-in-class CBT, in my opinion.  Perfect.

3) Daily commitment feels to complicated or involved.

Many apps make me dizzy with what they want me to do to get better.  This one asks me to select a minimal drawing of a mouth to indicate my mood, quotes a stoic philosopher to inspire me and then gives me the option of what I want to do from there, while first gently encouraging me to journal by prompting a conversation.  Perfect.",Daniel the Greek,stoic,1312926037,
True,2021-02-10 13:08:43,5,High Recommend!!,"I‚Äôve written a couple app reviews for this app before, but I just want to put in that after using it for about three months now, I must say that stoic is quite a wonderful app! It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I‚Äôd say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don‚Äôt mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That‚Äôs only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.",Raimabird,stoic,1312926037,"{'id': 20357398, 'body': 'could you check what hour you have in ‚Äöyour profile‚Äô -> personalize -> start day at?\n\nbest,\nm.', 'modified': '2021-01-12T22:23:35Z'}"
False,2021-02-09 00:02:49,5,The perfect app for my daily journaling needs,"I feel a deep debt of gratitude to the makers of this app. I feel as if I‚Äôve been searching for just the right journaling app and this one feels like coming home to the one made just for me. I am remembering back to the time around eleven years ago when I was jumping around between different Buddhist groups trying to find where I fit in before finally feeling at home with a Zen/Ch‚Äôan Buddhist group in Colorado. Anyways, to get back on the toping of Journaling. As I‚Äôve been exploring my inner self through meditative practices, I‚Äôve found journaling more and more useful. I‚Äôve also discovered practices such as Stoicism that have been very helpful too. This app seems to combine  meditative breathing exercises, with Zen and Stoic philosophy and also to be great at guiding the individual to emotional well being. Thanks for making such a great app!",JRBel,stoic,1312926037,
False,2021-01-10 15:16:09,4,"Excellent, with Some Minor Things","I‚Äôve tried a lot of apps like Stoic. and it‚Äôs unquestionably the best, and the only one I‚Äôve consistently stuck with. It‚Äôs simple but comprehensive and powerful. I love it, and use the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch versions daily to very positive effect.

My only critique is that sometimes the morning and evening question prompts will include questions that are very similar (‚Äúhow do you plan to spend the rest of today?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you plan to do today?‚Äù in the morning) and/or outright repeat questions (often ‚Äúwhat made you smile today?‚Äù in the evening). I suspect that I could avoid this by selecting/customizing my questions, but I like the sometimes unique questions that pop up and worry that if I don‚Äôt let the app decide, my experience with that feature of the app will stagnate. However, it is sometimes disruptive to the flow to have the same or similar question come up again.",grievedghost,stoic,1312926037,
