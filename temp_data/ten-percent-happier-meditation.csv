2021-02-26 06:58:08,"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder two years ago, and was told that I‚Äôve probably been suffering from it much longer than I realized. Fast forward to 2020 - I became a first-time mom at 38 years old, suffered from postpartum depression, and just when I was starting to find my footing, the world was immediately hurled into the COVID-19 pandemic. The stress wreaked havoc on my body. Everyday I felt like I was physically drowning; my chest was cramped, my muscles ached, I was permanently exhausted but couldn‚Äôt sleep, and my brain was foggy. I tried taking anxiety medication and it made me extremely nauseous, which further triggered my anxiety. I thought I was doomed; I felt so helpless. Then I read Dan Harris‚Äôs book, 10% Happier, and I figured if meditation helped him, maybe it would help me. Now I use the app daily, in conjunction with a daily routine that involves yoga, reasonably healthy eating, supplements as recommended by my physician, and continued communication and collaboration with my support net of friends and family. It‚Äôs part of a bigger picture, and it has made a world of difference. Physically, the chest tightness and muscular tension have decreased significantly. And mentally I find myself much more resilient in the face of stress, especially the kind induced by the intrusive irrational fears that come with GAD. Thank you to the 10% Happier team.

2021-01-18 16:05:10,"Ten percent happier is the best meditation app hands down for me. This is the only app I found myself use consistently, not because of sheer will power but because I am actually very interested in the contents. I have logged over 380 minutes on the app last time I checked! Each module focuses on a theme, beginners meditation, coping with stress, and forming habits, etc. Each module consists of multiple lessons and is led by an experienced and insightful instructor. A typical lesson begins with a short interview and convo between Dan Harris, the host, and the meditation ‚Äúguru‚Äù. Dan asks questions on behalf of me and other people new to meditation and this format really helps to set the stage. I am being guided through every lesson and usually learn tidbit of new skill each lesson in being able to introspect better.

2021-01-30 15:19:42,"I am a single female, 66 yrs young, who just retired Oct 2020. I had planned to retire end of 2020, but COVID moved up that date. I am very happy with this decision, and more content every day. It took some time to get here for sure! Allot of this contentment is due to you Dan - and your ten percent happier team. 
I stared listening to your free podcast while on furlough March-July, along with several others podcasts.   When I went back to work it wasn‚Äôt long before I knew I was ready to retire NOW.  I worked in the travel industry and LOVED my job in Group Sales- but the workplace and the job was never going to be the same. At least while I was there. So I retired early, and was excited about my decision. 
As you may imagine- the real challenge for me was the isolation, which I knew was coming. I was loosing the social aspect of the workplace and with COVID there was no socializing with friends. In the beginning I had some really dark days.  Many questioned my decision to retire at this time. I heard your ad for the New Years meditation challenge and signed up. I have since bought the subscription to your app- (thanks so much for the discount!!) and continue to learn more about meditation. 
I have now gone through 3 months and feel more optimistic and excited then ever before! I can definitely see and feel the difference in how I am setting in.

My partner is usually skeptical of meditation and calls it ‚Äúwoo-y‚Äù. He was willing to try this with me.

I‚Äôm a beginning meditator, and am finding the sessions to be clear, positive and encouraging - and the coaches are all great. There are courses dealing with many of the things that beset us in life, and a number of shorter sessions as well.

 The one thing that I wish was added is a continuing refresh of additional 1 minute meditations. It‚Äôs a very stealthy - and successful- approach to luring you into another 5-10 minutes of meditating. 

BTW, I think the style of coaches is really important. I‚Äôve been using the  Calm app - for sleep stories - but am unable to use most of their meditation sessions; I‚Äôm so put off by most of the meditation coaches‚Äô intonation - the  breathy ‚ÄòI‚Äôm smiling beatifically from my trip to the ashram‚Äô kind of voice.

2021-04-15 14:19:00,"So I am using what is available for free. 

One of the problems I see with similar apps is how very little you get unless you pay for a subscription. And for many of us who can‚Äôt afford it or do not want another subscription, you are given very slim pickings. 

I have found that 10 percent happier is very generous. You have at least 20 (maybe 30 meditations) you can choose from for free, at varying lengths of times‚Äîwhich is perfect for those with busy lives or short attention spans (especially beginners). They also do have longer mediations or light/no guidance ones available for free.

I do wish we had more than one sleep meditation available, and I am not sure how to feel about putting the 2021 meditations behind a paywall after letting people listen to them for free for a short time.

But otherwise? This is a good service and great meditation device that is perfect for young and old folks alike. I hope you continue this nice balance of variety of free/paid meditations.

2021-05-03 19:04:03,"I was initially weary of meditation because of how it had been presented to me before. It seemed like something reserved for New Age practitioners (no hate to them at all) or tied to certain religions (again, no hate).  10% Happier, however, focuses on guided meditation practices removed from any religious or spiritual framework. It focuses on the moment and helping you to be kind to yourself and your inner thought life. 

It‚Äôs broken up into different courses based on different needs. Some of the courses help you with stress, or forming batter habits, or having more patience, etc. Each session within each course gives a video rundown of the concepts of that day‚Äôs mediation in the style of an interview between Dan Harris and the meditation professional who will then guide you in the actual practice. You are not locked in to these course once you start; you can mix and match as you go. There is even an entire section devoted to meditations designed to help you fall asleep!

I should note, however, that the free version only allows you into the basics course. While helpful, it is limited to teaching you the basics of meditation. The premium version can be purchased on a monthly or yearly basis and I highly recommend it. 

The interface is very clean and if you ever have questions, you can email a meditation professional from within the app and they will get back to you promptly with as much help as they can offer. 

For anyone looking for a wonderful, guided meditative practice, this is definitely worth a try. This isn‚Äôt some hokey space religion or some impractical, out of body experiment.

2021-03-12 02:14:29,"OMG!!  üòä This is by far the most informative, comprehensive, insightful, knowledgeable and helpful experience with meditation I have ever had!  I've tried many different apps and this one is my favorite and the most helpful hands down! 
Access to a variety of different teachers and access to so many valuable meditations on a wide variety of topics!  The walking meditations are some of my favorites.
I'm 65+, disabled and blessed to be a survivor of extreme narcissistic, emotional, physical and mental abuse most of my life.  I've used meditation and breathing exercises for many years to bring myself off the ledge more times than I can count!  Pills just don't do it.... This app has transformed my meditation practice to a level that I never imagined!  It's so empowering to bring myself back from panic without a pill. 
Now meditation comes very easily and deeply to me whenever I need to come back to my center, my heart and soul. It's as natural and easy as activities of daily life.  It can be tapped into at any time!  The benefits are lifesaving!  This gift of taking away the 
feeling of ""rules"" for proper, healing  effective meditation are non existent .  There aren't rules just a commitment to practice a few minutes everyday or a few days a week.  Whatever you feel is best for you in this moment.  The ""swinging from the chandelier"" anxiety and panic I used to live with every day have become a thing that I can control or for sure greatly decrease the intensity of. 
My need for prescription medicine to control my anxiety has decreased markedly.  My blood pressure is improving so much that my cardiologist has lowered the dose and # of doses per day! 
I feel a underlying sense of peace and calm that I can't explain!  It's like being 5 again and having nothing to think about but playing,  naps and TODAYS FUN! I find joy in the smallest of things!  Fixing a snack, walking in my neighborhood, MUSIC !  This app and instructors way of simplifying meditation language has changed me!
I meditate several times a day sometimes, it's like eating or getting dressed, it's part of my daily routine and if I miss a day it's okay, no rules!  Just a wonderful tool in my little box of tools that I can access when I need to.
I do believe that it's important to try to practice at least ~10 minutes 4-6 times a week for it to become a routine for you. You can use this tool anytime anywhere!  Once you learn how quickly you can get to that place of quiet inner peace then you just tap into that and go there for as long as you want or feel you need to.
How can I ever thank you enough! 
I would give you 10‚≠êÔ∏è if I could!
We need to be teaching these simple, effective self compassion & self care to our children as part of their education!

I benefited greatly with both instruction and learning and defining vocabulary and the history of meditation as well as aspects of Buddhism the theory and religion fir some guests. Learning about the science from Ivy League ( Stanford counts too ;) adds the epiracle foundation my brain needs. I joined the app for free and let it go after two weeks but I let it go. 

Then, finally, at the peak of frustration with the pandemic, how poorly I was managing stress, work, politics,  I joined in a 21 day challenge. I got to meet previous guests and their BIG brains like Kristen, Sam, Angela, Alexis and Lauri Santos was even my accountability friend! I just wanted more folks on ‚Äúmy team‚Äù, so I joined. I COMPLETED my 21 day challenge ( I had never meditated so consistently before)  and I completed the 6 part Habits mediation course. I am more aware & I am not alone. HUGE Insights a formed that help me manage. 

I enjoy the gentle reminder that comes to my phone. The CHECK mark I see when I complete a session and the tracker that keeps reinforcing my habit and holds myself accountable. I need this right now. 

In the app, Dan and crew give the facts before the meditation . This was was built for me! I start my coffee and listen to Dan give me the backstory and content. Then, while my coffee brews, I sit. 

I truly have been reformatted. Covid is still here. Uncertainty is still here. How I choose to manage all of it- has changed.

I don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù who else is listening and yet we have become a sangha of sorts- a group of people who has committed to making meditation a part of how we live during this unprecedented time.  I had trouble sleeping this morning so at 5:45am I listened to Dan and Jeff Warren and somehow the worry about not getting more than 6 hours of sleep is behind me and I‚Äôm more present in my body. And prepared to meet the day. You talked about humor and I related well to  how humor helps me cope with stress. We buried my mother in law yesterday at a funeral that was anything but typical. Only  8 of us were allowed to gather (in masks and gloves six foot distanced) to say goodbye. We couldn‚Äôt hug the immediate mourners. We could not shovel dirt on the casket or have shiva all of which are powerful parts of  Jewish custom. And yet we laughed standing there commenting about our creative masks. We appreciated the undertaker who acknowledged our loss.  And hours later in a moment of hysteria driving home from New Jersey to MA I noticed I had a small piece of melted chocolate in my palm somehow it missed my mouth and smeared all over the steering wheel. And I remembered our ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù first aid kit and used a highly sought after anti bacterial wipe for chocolate clean up ( after licking my palm) and we laughed aloud!

The content is great and prior to, and especially during, the pandemic lockdown I recommend this app for individuals that are skeptical about meditation and what it can do for them.  Each person that ended up trying the app or a basic breathing meditation told me that it actually helped them.  All of them were dealing with a large amount of stress and anxiety and losing sleep.

While meditation isn‚Äôt a cure all and not a replacement for medical help, it is as equally important as physical activity in maintaining your health and managing stress.

If you‚Äôre on a personal journey to better understand yourself and make different decisions in how you perceive the world and interact with others - 10% happier has a treasure trove of content and teachings that can guide you on that journey.

Now I get it, and I practice it, and I am slowly changing for the better. The content is informative, amusing, and down to earth instead of trying to sell spiritual enlightenment. The guidance hosts are varied and all high quality - I particularly like Jeff Warren, Alexis Santos, Sharon Salzberg (her focus guidance is favorited!), and Joseph Goldstein. 

I have exactly one complaint that cost the app a whole star: there is no search function!!!

I have a second complaint that is really a suggestion - a breath trainer would be great. 4/6/8 breathing really works and I would love to see a section in the app for it. 

A second suggestion: put favorites on the Home Screen in the app! Or into an iOS widget. The widgets seem to have broken in the latest iOS but that is also true of many other apps (some by big name software companies.)",A great start to mindfulness,4,Hawkwolf,"{'id': 23695452, 'body': ""Thanks for you kind review!

I am very careful about trials of subscription apps, and I have no idea how this happened. There is no way I would knowingly pay $100 for an app I hadn‚Äôt even tried.  I haven‚Äôt gone through many reviews, but I see at least one other person this happened to this month.

2021-01-03 07:55:21,"I used to really love this app. The mediations are great. I love how they have very specific topics. However I mostly used it for sleep meditations. Was super excited they had a whole sleep section! I‚Äôve actually done every single one in that section except a couple that are locked unless you pay. I was fine with that. Suddenly, I can‚Äôt do almost any of them (even though I‚Äôve done them before) without paying. It tells me to subscribe for $99.99 a year. This made me pretty upset. I get that they have to make money and that there will be a version you have to pay for. And I‚Äôm sure that it probably would be worth it. But some people can‚Äôt afford that. For some people the lack of money is a stressor that pushes us towards mediation. And now that is being taken away. I understand that you can get free mediations on YouTube or something but I really enjoyed the structure of this app. In a time where people are out of work and struggling during the pandemic, I felt it in poor taste for them to take away most of their free content. While the product is good and I understand it‚Äôs fair for them to be paid, $100 a year just isn‚Äôt doable for some and to take away what was already free at a time like this seems a little tone deaf.",Good mediations but too pricey,3,SarPriz,"{'id': 20244068, 'body': ""Hi there - We're so glad mindfulness meditation has been helpful to you with sleep.
