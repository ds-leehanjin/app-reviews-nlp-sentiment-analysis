magtb,Great!,2021-02-01 16:54:36,"This app is very good at its job; and I’ve only been using it for a day. Even though you have to pay for somethings still, it’s not getting in the way of you using the app. At all really. Are use the free version and it’s still great. Like with some other apps you have to bye like pretty much the entire thing to be able to use the app and if you don’t want to buy it then it’s pretty much just getting in the way of you using the app in its entirety. Which is quite annoying (specially in the fact that that’s pretty much every app out there). I am only reading this app five stars because of what I’ve seen so far. I haven’t been using it for that long clearly, but it still seems to be working. I love how you can customize pretty much the entire thing just to your liking. It is very good with letting you speak without caring. Like when you sometimes need to just talk but you can’t talk to specific people or you just feel like you can’t talk to specific people; yes well now you can. I love how you can just speak into it and not even care. Very good tool for remembering your thoughts and how you felt. Sometimes in the moment you don’t quite remember all of the things that happened to you and that day that you would like to remember and sometimes writing it down just doesn’t quite cut it. Anyways overall this app seems to be pretty good. It’s cute, it makes me feel good about myself, and makes me feel happy overall. I would recommend this app to a friend.",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
MilkTea&Boba,Just like a therapist!! But free!!,2020-03-14 01:43:51,"Overall, Reflectly is great app!! I really get to know myself better. Sometimes I don’t like speaking to people about my problems, so this app is PERFECT!! I don’t know why, but I feel more collected, calm, and less easily be irritate after I use this app in the morning. I’m just less likely to blow up and scream after my sister doesn’t give me my space and thinks she is the boss of everyone and everything!! This is app is so awesome!! ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ 
  Every great app always has multiple minor flaws. Reflectly only has 1 minor flaw: There price of the special membership. It’s Special 
membership price is about $80 a year. That’s a bit much. The thing says that it will help you become happier when Reflectly helps you solve your problems. I think you should get that no matter what! That isn’t a reason to pay that much a year. I’m not trying to hate on this app. It’s a great app!! I love it! I just mean Reflectly shouldn’t have the price of a special membership be so high! Some people have many problems and don’t know how to fix them. Those type of people need Reflectly to help them with those problems without paying $80!! This is a great app anyways! I think if you maybe take the price away, it’ll be the BEST app that you can have. What’s not to like; you get to know yourself better, not get irritated easily, and most importantly, BE YOURSELF!!",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
Kk11114,Updated review!,2021-01-02 17:27:07,"I reached out to the reflectly team to get help for my issue below and Nicole reached out to me with a very supportive response and was able to immediately fix the issue and get me my membership. I really appreciated this and am happy to be starting my new year with this app! Thank you again! 

I downloaded the app and it immediately asked for a year subscription, I was interested and decided to buy. It purchased and had me do my first log of my mood. I did that and everything was great! But then it asked me to create an account so I typed in my email address and it said this is already in use, maybe try signing in? So I backed out of the app to go back to the home page where i could sign in and I signed in successfully. But I checked my account and not only is my first log missing but the subscription was missing and it said ""basic plan active"" so I was confused and clicked on the ""activate reflectly"" and clicked redeem offer to see if when it connects to my apple account it will recognize I have already paid for the subscription. Well it didn't and charged me again because I got a text from my credit card saying I was charged another $63 but the app said ""error occurred"" and never gave me the subscription anyway! Point is I have two payments of this year subscription and no subscription. Please help",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
pucca12027,Brother this is amazing!,2020-04-02 15:01:50,"I have been using this since I was 4 years old! I know that sounds so weird but it’s true! Every time I went home I would sit on my iPhone and will ya know! Write my feeling, what I did today, but there’s a question... WHY IS THIS APP SO GOOD!! I know I know I’m going to crazy, it’s just I love this app so much that I wanna write again when I was 4 years old I used to write a lot, but when I turned 8 years old I started stopping to write... but now since I’m 20 I wanna write again! I know it sound weird because I’m 20 years old again so i wanna write again!This app is amazing I want updates also! I don’t care if it’s a little update or a big update but..I like it the way it is it’s beautiful 😍 I hope you feel good, this is a quote I made “whenever you see a flower blooming it makes you bloom and grow!” Yes I know it’s kinda weird but it’s true! Your growing and there blooming, I’m not used to write a long paragraph but I think this needs a long nice paragraph 📄, anyways um more about the 4 years old... I also stopped writing because my mom didn’t like when I write! But now since I’m in my own apartment I can do whatever I want (of course I’m gonna clean my walls and floors!) even I want to read again!

avebud,Love it but some things are bad.,2020-02-28 12:06:24,"Ok so I really love this app, it’s really nice and aesthetic. It’s so fun to write your whole day down. What your mood was, the things you did today, and then you can look back at all those stories. Which is a lot of fun and very relaxing. 
I do have a couple of problems though. So I was browsing and I accidentally hit the log out button. Obviously you can log back in, but when I logged back on everything was gone. I was literally going to cry. The whole thing was gone, it said I had no stories or streaks or anything. I was able to download my data and get it sent to my email, but I then had to rewrite everything. Which I was willing to do. I started writing one then went to bed. I woke up and looked at it and it was still gone. The poof it’s all back, I don’t know how but it was all back there. Ok my next problem. I do love Reflectly but to only be able to do one thing in not premium is annoying. So basically you have to enter 7 stories and you unlock your status. Then I’m going to look at my status and it says you have to have premium. I will pay for premium but I don’t want to, I’m going to save up my money. I read this in one review and I thought it was a good idea. You could complete like a certain amount of stories to unlock let’s say status. Actually unlock it though, be able to look at it and everything. So personally if this was my game I would do this. Thank you.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
😀👌❤️lovely_app_reviewer!,Reflectly! 😀 (please read!),2020-08-18 20:20:24,"I absolutely love reflectly! BUT... there is one thing. The only thing I am a bit dissatisfied with is the lack of options that the people who do not want to pay a subscription for the “premium”. (Keep in mind that the subscription is QUITE a bit of money!) So reflectly, I would really appreciate it if you guys could add some more options for the people who don’t want to pay the monthly subscription. Other than that, I would love to elaborate on how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! First of all, this app helps so much with daily check ins (if that makes any sense) on how the users of this app days are going, and the way that this app doesn’t just leave us all struggling (this is me) to search our mind of what to write about the day we had— it gives us good and realistic questions to answer. I also must add that the feature of adding pictures to the journals is amazing because you never know when one of us users may want to sneak in a pic of a nice day at the beach, cool food etc. overall, I love this app and am looking forward to the future updates. Thank you for taking this time to read this rewiew!!! 👌❤️😁 truly pleased— these 5 golden stars are all shining bright and true!!!",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
Mb120983746632,Brand new and loving it,2020-05-20 21:12:51,"I just completed my first story, and it felt good to have something to write my feelings down in with major convenience. You don’t have to write anything (but you have the option to), it asks you to rate you day, what made you’re day that way, and how you felt throughout the day (you just press which one you feel, there plate options for this part, no typing required) There are also achievements that you can earn as time goes on. 
*update* 
I’ve been using the app for a while now, and I was really enjoying it, but today when I went into the app it said I had to login, which I’ve never had to do before. I don’t think it ever made me set my email to it or make an account, because I tried the password recovery multiple times and it just said that something went wrong. So now I can’t access any of my previous stories, which I’m very upset about because the main reason I got this app was so that I could go back and read them in the future, and it was more convenient to use than pen and paper. I guess I’ll be sticking to using paper from now on because all of my time just got wasted with this app. I would recommend this app because it has a good layout and it is more convenient than keeping a hand written journal, but for me personally it is not worth the risk of losing it all because the app all of a sudden needs you to “sign in”.",2,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
TheNauds,Love this app,2020-05-12 17:43:15,"This app is amazing. I have tried to start journals before and have always failed. I am not much of a big writing fan, when I would write in a journal I would not get to write everything I wanted because I didn’t want to write that much. My mind was going to fast for my hands so I would write summaries of what was going through my head. This made for a not so good journal entry. I would also forget to write often or just simply choose not to because I didn’t feel like writing. Luckily I am a faster typer than a writer so I am able to keep up with the thoughts going through my head. It is also a lot easier to write everyday because I can choose to get notifications. The app also has an amazing design that is pleasing to the eye ,and all my little entries look super neat rather than my sloppy- tired of writing, handwriting. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t know how go express their feelings or feels like they have no one to talk to because it is a great way to get those feelings off your chest. That is actually why I got this app because I struggle with talking about how I feel so, being able to write about has allowed me to relieve a lot of stress.",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
kittyawsomness,Good,2020-06-05 00:45:57,"The app itself is great. It has a really nice concept, it isn’t glitchy, it’s calming and entertaining. It does what it says it’s going to do. So the reason I put this as a four star rating is because to get the fully version you have to pay money. This is the case with a lot of apps, but this one in particular has not a lot of features without paying. I personally don’t want to pay money to get extras in an app that’s meant for writing. But the point of this app is to pretty to much have an online diary so it’s great. The other reason this is not a five star rating is because the app will sometimes delete what I have previously written and make me start over. For example, a few weeks back I wrote in this app every day. I stopped for some time and I today went back to look at my old writing and it was gone. I had to start from scratch with all of my preferences and my name. It isn’t the most convenient but it is overall a good app. It works for me, but if you’re looking for something a little bit more reliable it could be a little bit frustrating. But it has a nice aesthetic and calming effect, so I would recommend for those who need some interaction and somewhere to just process your day or something you are going through.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
MS ANONYMOUSE,You guys are so awesome!,2020-09-11 02:20:12,"I just wanted to say how awesome and considerate the people who made this app are. Out of everything they could’ve done, they chose to make something that would help us grow mentally and spiritually. I hope this app grows, just like the people who used it have. Great app and awesome features. I like how there are a lot of different moods, situations, and causes to choose from. I love how you guys helped me to realize how I was feeling, and how there was more to me than happy and sad. It’s really good for people who don’t have someone to talk to at the moment, and for people who just had a bad encounter. I like how it’s not complicated and the aesthetic is relaxing and makes me feel...supported? 😂 I’m not sure how to explain it, but if you don’t download this app you’ll miss out and regret it. I didn’t know if at the time, but this app would be the point in my life where I decide to be more patient, grateful, kind, not wasteful, and put myself in other peoples shoes. I’m still very very young (a lot younger than you may think) but this app inspired me to let God take control of my life. Thank you guys a lot!

thecommamaster,"Great app with beautiful UI, but improvements are welcome.",2021-01-03 05:16:08,"I love Reflectly. The UI is absolutely gorgeous, the animations are slick, and the whole app is great to use. The check-ins are great, and the voice notes and photos are also a great addition. I love adding a photo or two that highlight my day. The app’s been doing a lot for me, and I love it. However, there are a few improvements that could make it even better. First, the iPad app is pretty bad. It works, but there’s no trackpad support, so things are still pretty awkward. The text formatting is awkward (there’s no cursor, so you don’t really know where you’re typing). I’d like to see a more advanced text editor for journaling with rich text formatting, inline image support, different (preset?) text sizes, bullet lists, the works. After all- the app costs $60/year. Apple Pencil support would be wonderful, it would be great to have a hybrid journal with typed entries in addition to handwritten entries. Support for scribble would also be a welcome improvement. Another great improvement would be the ability to add videos along with images. I’m unsure if Reflectly is already encrypted, but it would be a great idea to include the option to encrypt your journal and its entries with a custom key like Jour does.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
Ascfser,It was great until the update...,2020-05-18 21:31:47,"So I have been using REFLECTLY for almost 40 days now, it has helped me so so much during the Quarantine. I loved the happy notifications, the thought provoking questions, and the pictures it would give me for each of my journals. When I would be having a bad day, I loved writing about it, and being given a picture of an adorable puppy, or a rainy window with a heart on it. I always smiled by the time I was done using reflectly. I still have my journals, but now all the happy pictures are gone? Sure if I attached any images those are still there, but I don’t get the ones that Reflectly gave me. It makes me really sad and the app just looks bland now. It’s kinda annoying having to sign in every time I want to open the app too. Like I get it for privacy reasons, it just seems silly when it’s on my phone. I miss how the reflectly used to be laid out and I am kindly asking maybe try to come to a compromise? I loved it until it updated, if it’s about like scrolling through perhaps just add like a scroll bar at the bottom underneath your journals how it was laid out to help for easy navigation. It’s just a thought and I know I’m not the only one that dislikes the update, I’m just putting it in kinder words.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
11234livj,Awesome app but some minor issues,2020-04-11 04:16:40,"I have been loving the app. It’s been helping me a lot and I love journaling but just never feel like writing on paper. So this was the perfect app to get me in the habit of reflecting on my day without getting discouraged by writing in paper. However, I am giving 4 stars because lately, when I go in to add a story, knowing that I am connected to WiFi because other WiFi required apps work, when I try to click let’s go when adding the story, I get the same message telling me that something went wrong because of an internet connection problem. So I will check with google and other apps that need WiFi and they load just fine. I’m not sure if this is the actual app or just my iPhone that’s crashing. I never write reviews but thought that if you (the app developers) saw this, you might be able to try and fix it, if it is the app. But because of this issue I haven’t been able to add stories for the past couple nights. Even my morning moment are not loading the actual text. Just the headings. Anyways, I hope this can be fixed if it is a glitch in the app, but seeing other reviews it doesn’t look like anyone else is having this problem.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
monapooh,decent app,2020-05-18 05:20:26,"It is no doubt that the app helps people reflect on major experiences in their life while acting as a coping mechanism for anxiety and stress. I personally love using the app, and whenever something major happens in my life, the first thing I go to is this app and just rant about it. But after using this app for quite a while now, I believe there should be some modifications to make it an even better experience for users. 
1. Saved drafts: I would appreciate if there was a way to collect drafts of stories and save it. Not only can people come back to the draft to write more, but it can also some tons of time. I once wrote about 1000 words about a day, and for some strange reason, my phone shut me out of the app and my writing was gone. It disappeared. I was so descriptive about my day and it just went away. But if there was an option to hold drafts in which stories would save automatically (such as google docs or something), then I could easily find access back to my story and it wouldn’t have been lost. 
2. vertical display: I hope this makes sense, but I think it would be more convenient to slide up and down to access stories instead of sliding left to right.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

This app calms me down when i do check-ins and lets me kind of express my feelings when there is nothing to express them too. I also love the inspirational quotes i get everyday, and how i get to chose how many times a day i get them ( I personally set mine to 8 x a day)! And i love how i can view my stats , i also love how you get to CHOSE if you pay for premium and if you don't you still get let into your app and get to experience other features unlike other apps.. and to end off my review it is amazing and i definitely recommend it ! Its not like other diaries and then again keeps me calm because Reflectly asks me questions that if i was writing in my diary i would just be straight forward, wright about it and be done! But here they ask you questions so its like talking to a person but now having secrets and people talking about it and sharing things that happened to you when its none of there business( i experience that alot).

Drew Terista,I totally recommend this app.,2020-03-29 21:51:19,"I know I rated it five stars but Im just upset because first off, I’m 13 and don’t have a credit card so I can’t subscribe to a priemium
Account. I’m in seventh grade and I have a lot of work and homework. It’s giving a lot of stress and Recently I lost a couple friends and on top of that, I’m not doing so well in school. Also my dad isn’t very close to me. All these things are making me feel not myself. Some nights I can’t sleep I’m so sad.
Anyway enough about my life. I’m pretty sure this app would’ve helped me but like I said, I don’t have a credit card so I can’t really do anything. That’s why I rated it five stars because this app looked helpful. Anyway I know the priemum membership is the way the app developers make money and I understand that. But maybe you could put some ads in there and take away some payments that would be fantastic. But if you can’t I completely understand that that’s how

But I will say I hate the new format since its last update or two. If you’ve never used the app then I’m sure this won’t be too much of an issue and feel free to download it if you like! But as someone who got used to and grew a liking to the older format I just wish there was an option like a switch or something that lets you switch between which format you want (the one that scrolls up and down, AKA current format, or the one that scrolls left to right) the main reason I wish for the old format is I just miss having a photo as a cover image along with the title on it, then having you tap on it to open your summary and such. With the new formatting there isn’t really a need for a cover image. I liked using cover images to sum up what I did that day like a photo of something I got at the store or somewhere I went that day etc. Aside from a cover image, I do think it takes a bit longer to scroll down and find past entries opposed to scrolling right and left.

jsbehevigshdjrjehfmrrhf,To pay the price,2020-09-01 20:05:46,"This  app is so useful! I love it it can help you stay calm and can help you with your bad days. This is much better than a journal because it’s online you don’t have to buy supplies like pens pencils sticker if you want and a notebook and with a regular journal you have to worry about a marker bleeding and the quality of the paper, or even misspelling words and over all the mistakes you can make. I personal love all the aesthetics of a journal. I mean all the pretty colors, the cute stickers, and just the whole concept. This app doesn’t have that but still gives me the satisfaction of a journal! But the ONE problem for me is the price you pay 20 bucks a month about 100 bucks a year and 200 buck for when ever you use it. Now to me that’s pretty expensive. And when kids or teens like me grow up we might not have interest in stuff like this or we might be to busy and I’ll basically end up wasting 200 or 100 bucks on it. So you can still use the app but I’m just saying if you want a journal I’d rather recommend just making one yourself because the price is just too high. If they take away the price that would be the best thing ever so. Yeah

JessiBallard,You have to pay to do anything.,2021-01-12 21:34:04,"I’ve had this app since i believe January of last year, and i started heavily using it during lockdown for covid and it helped me manage my thoughts and feelings and it became easier to progressively work through them. I was most of all enjoying the morning motivation, and for the end of the day check-in, it would ask a question of the day which was my absolute favorite part. However, in this most recent update, I’m unable to do either of these things without paying for a subscription. The only thing i can do for free is look at past entries and view the quotes page. What I don’t understand is if the purpose of the app is to journal, why do i have to pay to do it? And so suddenly too? It’s like a music streaming app offering music you can listen to for free and after your 3rd song, they make you shell out some cash if you want to keep listening to music. I wish they would consider going back to the original format, im sure most people would pay for the premium subscription, and then people who are satisfied with the free version can continue to use the app. It’s disappointing because I was really enjoying this app and how it was helping me and now i’m forced to find something else that’s suitable for me mentally and financially.",1,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,"{'id': 20520412, 'body': 'Hi there JessiBallard 👋\r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to review the app.\r\nI´m so sorry that you’ve had an unfortunate experience with Reflectly.

WhatTheCJ,Error while saving...,2020-02-06 03:47:42,"I receive an error while saving rather frequently. I’d say at least once a week. When that happens, there is no way to recover. I have to manually go thru the story and copy my entry so that I won’t lose it... not to mention, text selection is garbage so trying to get the “Select All” text hover button to appear is hit or miss. Why is there no way to “Save as Draft” or some other method of error reporting? What is the error? Also, why is an internet connection required for journal entry? I understand backups of the entries require internet, but why does actually creating a new journal entry require internet? 

Overall, I regret spending a yearly membership on this app. I have removed my subscription. Will continue to use for the remainder of my subscription, but then will switch apps completely unless things change. 

Fantastic concept, love the prompts. Minor tweaks like being able to select multiple icons when choosing what made the day good or bad would be nice (although you can select multiple if you edit the story, weird workaround) and adding multiple pictures would be nice. I really do like the concept, this is the journaling app I’ve been looking for.

Arielpuppy1,Why you should definitely get this app,2021-01-13 03:12:16,"I have always been skeptical with mental health apps just because if you think about it, how can an app help me with my problems. This app does just that! In the morning you get one simple motivating task to do so you can get your day started off right and throughout the day when you feel the need to talk about your feelings you can. At night you have a prompt to help you better understand your problems. One thing that really has helped me is the notifications. That might sound weird but during the day the app will send you quotes and personally quotes like that inspire me to be better and I really like being able to choose ones that you relate to the most. After about five days of using the app to tells you about your feelings and if your getting better or not and other things.

Until I came across Reflectly on tik tok, first off the ad really really inspired me that it was a great stress blow over for me, and I tried it out and it was great. And I know that there is some member ship and stuff on there which I don’t have and totally support because the great team that has designed this app need to grow there business (money wise) and I don’t know why so many people are mad at this member ship and stuff tbh I think that it’s people choice weather they want to use this app seriously and every single day, which I only use sometimes when I feel there is something to get off my chest or there is something to write down so I will remember it.

However, there are some serious problems with the app. Something that frustrates me significantly is your promotions for buying the full version of the app. I have no intention of purchasing the additional features because I cannot afford the full price once the promotion expires. What makes me angry is how I can’t even do my check ins, and I’m confused about what I can get for free. Every time I try to do a check-in, the promotion pops up. There is clearly something wrong with the app, because all of the top reviews are clearly from people who paid for the app, but there are other reviewers that are saying the same thing that I’m saying. Some older reviews even say that there were more features in the past, but you now have to pay for everything. If you are intentionally doing this, that is unacceptable. However I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt.

PLEASE MAKE THE APP USABLE FOR USERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE APP. If you cannot generate enough revenue from paid subscriptions, then make the price more reasonable.

itsfreakinbats,It’s alright.,2020-02-27 22:08:34,"I like using the app, it’s a beautiful interface. It always runs great. But I wish there was more to it. Yes, it helps me reflect on my day, get out my feelings without having to have a heart to heart conversation with someone. But having the premium version of the app, I expected more.
I wish the developers would add the option to reflect on more than one category. “Work, relationship, school, food, exercise, etc.” Why wouldn’t I want to speak on more than one category?
I also expected a more personalized approach. Give me more places to type in my goals, habits, something else. I can spend less than 5 minutes on the app a day and feel like I didn’t do anything to better myself. 
I would also like daily questions that seem of some significance. They always seem random, and at the end of a bay day the last thing I want to do is talk about what i think is most important in a friend.
I challenge the developers to dive deeper into their customers and explore a more personal connection with the app other than. “How was your day? Bad? Sorry, Good job!”",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
khaotickams,"Best App so far, Minus in app-purchase",2021-02-04 17:56:58,"I have mental health problems, so my therapist recommend I try to use a mood tracking app. I was worried, as I don’t usually follow through and use these regularly. But the feature to have it check in multiple times a day, and to send positive remarks is an AWESOME feature.
However, I have a variety of mental health issues, and do understand that a company has to make their money. But the “positivity reminders” are limited to relatively random issues in the basic version. Anxiety, autism, wisdom are available, which I think is awesome. But a large client base is going to have depression and stress problems as well. If those options had tiers, it may be more affective for a wider audience of users. That would be willing to pay for those better options after seeing if the reminders are actually helpful. 
I know there’s a trial, I just don’t think 3 days is enough time to see any actual mentality differences. 
Overall, really like the app. Just wish it was a bit more widely usable for different issues without in-app purchases.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

an crooks slal,the best journaling app - ever.,2021-03-03 04:23:23,"in all my years of having apple products i’ve never once written a review for an app. but this app... this... app... is the best journaling app i’ve ever downloaded. i’d been trying to get into consistently journaling for a few years now but nothing never really stuck, until i found this. i will admit, if you just have the free version it’s not worth it. paying ~$1.25 a month for this is a game changer. i write it in probably 3 times a day or whenever I’m feeling something/need to get words off my chest.
you can track your mood, what’s making you feel that way, and emotion you’re feeling. 
it gives you daily motivational quotes whenever you need them, however many times a day you’d like. 
the user interface is BEAUTIFUL and incredibly easy to navigate. i will recommend this app to any and everybody i know. 
if you’re struggling with your mental health right now and looking for a way to help improve it, this is your sign. this app is for you. try it. it’s amazing.",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

So ReflectlyIs a very calm app and when I started writing I started being aware of what I was really stressed out about. Some days were hard for me because of all the work I had to do for school… But at the end of the day I can always come to reflectly and you know… write about my day and it kind of makes me self-conscious and more calm in myself. I would recommend it to anyone who requires self-care in and who needs to bring their life together. But also this app is for anyone! You can write in the journal even when you’re happy because it just brings nice memories and it’s really to reflect and remember what you did and I can also take a flashback when you’ve written before and I just really love this app and I would recommend it to anyone who either has stress or I also recommend it to people just like to write in general or like to get their thoughts out ! 💞😄,5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Then later on,I deleted the app. I’m not sure if my memory is terrible and I don’t remember how it was then (in 2019) But it just doesn’t seem the same to me. I remember that I was able to write so so much. But now since I don’t want to pay I can only write, well I mean I can’t even write, but I’m just able to tell the app how I’m feeling. To my memory, it gave you a question on how or why I felt that way I’m pretty sure. But now like I said before, it only asked me how I feeling and why I feel that way. I mean I think you’ll be a great great app if you were to pay, but I’m a broke person so,I don’t want to pay... but until I find an app that lets me write about how I’m feeling and is just amazing. For now, I will just have to make do with this one. By the way I know that there’s the notes thing but that’s not the same thing as what I remember OK? got it? Someone please let me know if I’m right in the app has changed or I am terribly wrong you know that I’ve hasn’t changed whatsoever.

Izzy_ImmortalGamer,Reflectly is Amazing! Just one thing...,2021-02-22 15:02:57,"I absolutely love this app! It helps me wind down and focus on my feelings. To be honest, it’s almost like the friend I don’t have who asks me if I am OK. You can customize the background to the color you like the most, and can do however many mood check-in’s you want at any time during the day. There is only one thing I am not a fan of with this app. I am aware everyone needs to make money and this app might be what puts food on the table for some people, but I don’t get why the membership has to be so expensive. First they give you the option for $15 dollars a year, which is acceptable, but they cut it down from $60 dollars? The features in the membership aren’t even that great, but there are a lot of them, which makes using Reflectly without the membership a lot less fun. However that is my only complaint and apart from that (mostly not being able to journal without paying) this is an amazing app that I 100% recommend to relax, reduce stress, and get to know yourself and your feelings better.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
wet arse kitty,I can’t do ANYTHING,2021-01-05 09:43:22,"I downloaded this app back in April. And I liked it because it was a place where I can write my thoughts out. Around December 26, I went to write in a journal entry and it would let me do anything if I didn’t go premium. I don’t know if this is a bug or it’s going to be permanent. Or they are doing this because they want people to spend money so that they can have money, so that the users can have a basic function like journaling. Or some users are just using the basic plan, like me, and they need or want extra money. I started to really like this app because it did the basic functions. But it doesn’t even allow you journal. How can an app that is meant for journaling not allow its users to journal without paying. I switched to Daylio and I fell like it’s better. You can actually do something’s that you couldn’t do on Reflectly like look at statics, even allows you to create goals for yourself. It has some features that Reflectly doesn’t have. I’m not telling that you should switch to Daylio. But I’m just saying that this has worked for me and I don’t really have any issues with it.

Marie Rose Lily,Great with some things and okay with others,2020-07-08 00:22:03,"I really like the idea of the app and I really like the new update. Before this update, the app had a lot of bugs and they are mostly fixed but my biggest complaint is for the daily reflections and then quotes in the morning moments, they often repeat themselves. I was hoping with the update this would be fixed but it hasn’t been so far. I understand if they repeat every couple months, but I’ll get prompts within the last few weeks I recognize immediately and same with the quotes. I messaged on Facebook before to provide feedback and the bots they have are super annoying. Overall, I’m good with having this for a year, and I like that it’s more flexible now, but I likely won’t renew. People complaining about being charged is a little silly to me because they don’t have an ad revenue and you are paying for a service. Whatever that price is, if you divide it as a daily rate it comes up to a few cents per day and it’s an investment in your mental health.

PeacefulAwesome,The app while good in concept isn’t as well in practice,2020-05-26 00:18:34,The big problem is the subscription. I had the app for less than five minutes and three fourths of that time was spent looking at the subscription. I understand that apps need money but this app is made to help people relax and reflect. It doesn’t help that the app is rated 4+ which makes it seems like it accessible to most ages when in reality most parents won’t pay for the subscription and it will cause stress to whoever’s using. Also just making the Premium stuff not so in your face would be helpful. The app might as well be notes at that point. This app isn’t free it’s a hoax with a shiny cover. If your willing to pay fine but seriously it’s not okay to put free as this apps price. It isn’t free so just make them pay up front and the subscription fee. Or another option put that you need a subscription in the first line of the description. And if your only reason for not doing that is because people will be discouraged from entering the app then don’t worry because you already did that with the “Premium”.,3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I first seen this on instagram and said “Maybe it won’t be so bad and will help” and I think it did. I may be young like younger than 14 but I do have lots of problems at school and home, and telling someone or something my problems makes me feel a little better. I personally think that talking through technology or paper is easier than talking in real life face to face with another, some stuff that also helps me is Minecraft, anime, gacha, and drawing.

But I really liked the format before the 3.0.2 update! I loved how I had daily entries because it felt like a nice way to wrap up my day and I also liked being able to customize it with a cover picture. Now there’s no way to title things and it’s just a basic “moment”. Now everything is all condensed and just how much stuff is crammed into the timeline makes it look less appealing. 

Also I’m not able to get daily questions anymore?? Idk if they just changed this to only a premium feature but that’s just mean. Like I get that they want money from premium members but it’s not fun when you’re left with nothing interesting to do without the premium membership.

About a year ago, I could add journal entries, post pictures, answer the daily reflection question, and open my “morning motivation” for the day. I took a break from the app and used another app (Daylio) to journal, and when I came back around a month ago, I noticed the layout had drastically changed AND the reflection questions were locked for premium members to use only. I’m just a teenager, so I don’t have the money to buy premium. So I thought, “Okay, I still have my morning motivation.” Well, today I noticed that the morning motivation had become locked too! Now I can only add entries and scroll through inspirational quotes. I really like the animation and “cuteness” of this app, but I think I’ll stick to Daylio for journaling, since I can write journal entries, add pictures, check most of my stats, add goals, etc. Hope you’ll add some small features that are available to free users if I return!",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
🦋Allison🦋,Makes Me Anxious,2021-02-11 17:08:28,"I know this app is supposed to help improve mental health, but it’s doing the opposite for me. One big problem is that, within the app, there’s a timer counting down to when a special deal for premium runs out, and I’m scared of timers. There’s no way to close it; it’s always there, quietly counting down. Another problem is that it gives you a daily task. The one I got was to “say no to something you usually say yes to”. I was anxious the entire day because I didn’t know what I was going to say no to. I almost decided to say no to one of my meals since I’m overweight, but luckily, I had the brilliant idea to say no to the challenge instead. The third thing that makes me anxious is that it won’t let you journal after your free trial ends. Instead, it pushes you to get premium in order to use the CORE FEATURE of the app! This was the last straw that caused me to delete the app after less than 48 hours. It seems as though this app cared more about money than the well-being of its customers.

My Reflectly has been an outlet for all the strife in my life. I love the UI. It’s very user-friendly. You can add pictures to the days you write your reflections on, and it even helps you actually reflect and think about things in your life by asking you a question every day for you to answer. There’s no pressure to write entries, make pictures or write the answers to the questions. 

I have been through the hurricanes that nearly destroyed our custody and relationship issues, people taking advantage of us when we were in need, a shooting, family issues, accidental overdose resulting in seratonin issues and hallucinations, severe sickness, creepy hillbillies trying to mess with us, and of course the political climate of 2020...and because of this I have severe anxiety. Reflectly has a a friendly UI and non-agitating color scheme. They’ve only ever really made changes to it once that I can recall. 

     I recommended features to Reflectly and they actually communicated with me on Facebook messenger rather promptly. Come to find out, you can download your Reflectly in a PDF. The only drawback is that it messes up the parts where you separated your paragraphs, which is why for now my review is four stars. I think they actually listen to our concerns so it should be fixed soon. I’ll go back and check just to be sure.

Thankfully I can still keep journaling because I downloaded multiple journaling apps in case something like this happened. I feel bad for all the other people on here who are upset. Some people have been using this app for years and now all of a sudden need a subscription. It’s just wrong. The only reason this app still has good reviews is because all of the five star reviews were posted a long time ago, before they asked for subscriptions. I think the subscription thing was applied recently because all the people complaining about it on reviews were posted this week at the time I’m writing this.

da_unknown,Really good journal app,2021-03-25 07:42:48,"I just got the app and right off the bat it seem pretty good. I don’t have a written diary or anything so when I’m on the road this is great for when I want to jot something down really quick. One reason I didn’t rate a full 5 ⭐️ was because of how many quotes your limited to.. I like the quotes but there are a ton of them when u subscribe. It just my opinion but I think that if you added a couple more like maybe 2 or 3 small categories for the quotes, that would really make it a great app. Other than that it’s been a great app for writing down my feelings 👍 

-edit I saw the price when I went to the app and I miss judged. Most subscriptions or in app purchases are either money grabbers or scams. This one is actually really good and it’s a nice low price too. Once I get enough I wouldn’t mind going for the premium version. I’m changing my rating to a 5 star rating ⭐️👍",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

You can have multiple check-ins a day if you want too, if you skip any days there’s no notifications to tell you to come back and it’s completely your choice what you want to put down. Reflectively sends you emails about every day/every other day just asking about if you’re feeling ok or not, which is also completely optional. You can pay for Reflectively if you want to, but you don’t have too!! The app is just still really great and I don’t even pay for premium! You can change the settings anytime you want, and you can write notes on each day just saying how it was if you don’t feel comfortable telling someone through text and/or in real life. I think this app is/would be totally great for mentally unstable people, and it’s very calming. 10/10",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I love that you can now do the voice note for when you just want to something really quick.  It’s great to go back and look at everything to see how I’ve progressed.  I really love to see all the quotes as well  One of my favorite things about the app is the morning motivation.  I really try to do the goals, even though most of the time I don’t get to. 

I know this is how you make money with this app, but I feel like there should be more things without the membership.  I also think there should be more emotions to pick from other than the 5 because a lot of the time I am in between.

Shay .M,It’s good but I was a little disappointed,2020-06-13 18:42:20,When I first got Reflectly I loved the aesthetic and how it made me feel. When I started to explore the app I realized that things such as a daily question and daily reflection were only for premium users. I looked at how much premium costs ($9.99 a month) and decided it was just to much. I still  like the app and the idea of what there goal is but I think that lowering the price for premium would be a good idea. I understand that they need to make money but for an app designed for mental health I think $9.99 is a little pricey for something that is one of the main reasons I got the app. I was looking for an app that would offer daily reflection and a daily question but I was soon disappointed that the “perfect app” that I was looking for couldn’t offer that to me at a price I could pay. Over all I still love the app but I really wish I could get the full experience at a more reasonable price for me.,4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I was always wondering who I really was, why am I so sad, I shouldn’t be happy right now, and, the one I thought the most, I need to talk to someone. And then I found this app. This app turned into the “someone” I needed to talk to. My moods have changed from sad, lonely, and lost, to ‘holy guacamole it feels great to be alive and happy’! I’ve captured memories with the “Moments” feature, and love the daily reflective questions! To anyone who needs to talk about their feelings, but can’t seem to talk to anyone, this app is for you.

P.S. To Anyone Who Is Feeling Lost And Alone:
You are amazing! You are here for a reason! Don’t you dare think you’re not good enough brocade you are! I’ve been where you are, and I can tell you things WILL get better! Just hold on in there , ok? This world needs more people like you!",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

With this app you can write don’t wether you feel okay or down write how your day was AND add “moments” meaning photos and videos stuff witch I love and it’s easier then writing it down on a piece of paper with is helpful cause my hands hurt easily when I wrote it down on paper. 

You can also read others people log ins but not just about any day about certain things like depression and how to help with it witch is super helpful and a great way to get over it, it really felt like someone was there helping me get through it.

The only thing is, is I don’t usually buy premium or monthly payments and stuff so I don’t have all the features so I can’t say the WHOLE app is amazing but the part that’s free is great! I would totally recommend this for people who just need to let out and pain, anger, depression, or just to write down your day to make you feel just that much better! 

I love this app so much and use it when I’m in quiet places and need to let something out or just really want to write it down, sometimes I can’t just go telling the world about to day (ik I’ve tried 😂).

TrentU,Decent but annoying,2021-03-19 14:18:04,"Reflectly is a journal that gives you insights into what days you’re happy and what made you happy. Not only can you do that yourself, but its locked behind a $60 paywall. Sometimes they offer “Just for you!” discounts but they don't actually drop the price at all. The quotes are a nice feature, not really a downside to them besides needing to pay to choose the type, but thats not a necessary thing. The app has a really sleek design that I love, but its annoying that you get a popup asking you to pay every time you open the app. If the team reads this, PLEASE stop with the advertising in your OWN APP. I understand that you have this service but it repulses me that it feels like one of those free mobile games where all the ads are for your own service. Finally, the actual journal checkins themselves. They are nice and helpful to get your thoughts and feelings out in an easier way than just seeing a blank page.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I love how I can add pics and stuff, because I can’t draw realistically to save my life, but on Reflectly, you just upload a photo and BAM! It’s there. I rant about friends and family. I can talk about boys and just random stuff in basic. I love how you can have a password, but you can also put your thumbprint in ( if you choose) It’s way better than an actual notebook. Those thing are not secure. Who knows who could get ahold of the lock, if it even has one! But on Reflectly, it’s all locked up. It even has little motivational messages in it.

And what would even lead to that. Just a terrible anti-user onbording experience. It’s pretty and cute on the surface but feels shallow and generic and ultimately just in it for your money based on their paywall. 

For those that will inevitable think but you can cancel the membership at any time, think about those who would benefit the most from this app. The people stressed out, they aren’t always in the best mind set to remember to cancel or may not even have the privilege of having funds to hold on their card as an authorized charge just to get past the paywall where you must get past to even cancel in iOS settings before trying to use the app.",1,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

The only reason I would not give the app five stars is that they need to create more daily questions as they have become very repetitive. Also, the daily affirmations are a bit hokey and also very repetitive. Finally, there need to be more moods added as well as more customization around the main focus topics of each day (family, work, etc.)

This app has helped me a lot and I stuck by it even after the update that I didn’t like that much and made the daily reflection cost money. I really wish I could use this app but in order to do so I have to get a premium subscription which I do not have to money for. Recently my mother passed away and I was going to write about how I have been feeling because choosing the emoji that represents how I feel and writing out what happens helps more then you could imagine and now I don’t have my healthy coping mechanism.

So I found this absolutely perfect! I love journaling but I haven’t really found good times to sit down and work on a journal entry, and this is really easy and simple, while also keeping a simplistic, cute aesthetic! I think this could also be a really good way to get into the habit of journaling if you don’t have a physical journal or don’t want to use a physical journal yet, because it just a simple thing to do, and it doesn’t take very long either! To conclude, I really think this app is a great way to just quickly check in on yourself and take a little time to reflect on your day, without being too cumbersome! Such a good idea to make this app!",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I have recently downloaded the app, and I come back every 3-4 hours to check-in, as well as read a few motivational quotes. I think the app is great without the subscription, and even better with it. I have one complaint and only one: too frequent notifications. I can always turn off the notifications, but the I tend not to notice apps and use apps as often. I get a notification every 1-2 hours, and it can sometimes be distracting or annoying at times.

One, you can’t paste text which means if you want to journal by hand, or type using a computer first and then paste it into the app, you’re out of luck. I’ve reached out to the developers for options but got no response. I also wish you could set the time of day you‘ll be journaling. I journal mid day but the prompts assume I’m writing in the evening. A small irritation, but still. That being said it has a beautiful, simple, and mostly intuitive user interface with one exception - there doesn’t seem to be any way to get help from the app. I had to come to the App Store to find contact info and then it sends you to FB messenger to message the company. Again, I got no response using this option. Overall, the app has a lot of potential, but the paste issue may make me look for alternatives.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I love keeping track of times I grew or felt inspired or learned from my own mistakes. I do wish that the icon choosing step of the Moment process came at the end instead of the beginning. It’d be helpful for many reasons! When you decide to write a lot of the time it just hits you and you need to get it down, but you don’t know to begin with what all you might talk about so it’s be more appropriate to choose them after writing. For the money I do wish there was just a little something else to it.. maybe more than one question a day!

For anyone who likes this app, I’m not saying I hate it and you I’m just saying I don’t like the app that more or even maybe at all now from the update. I don’t like how much more things you have to buy. It’s just not as nice I as remembered it back when I was still in school. :/ 

It was fun while it lasted back during school. And because of corona I wanted to download this app again. But when I saw what changed I didn’t agree with the app that much anymore... I’m sorry if you like it but I can not agree. I want it to go back the way it was or I wish I could travel back to what it used to be, and I know that may sound a little over dramatic but I really don’t like the update.

So after a few short daily uses of the app, it brings to my attention that I have to pay for more journal entries. That’s not what I asked for! I really wish you could have unlimited entries, but that’s not the case. I might just have to delete the app and get a different one that has a different format...
Anyways, in the time spent using this app, I would rate it a 4 out of 5 stars. Very user-friendly. I would recommend to anyone who is fine with spending some money for this app. I really like journaling apps, and this one made it seem like I was talking to a real person.

Taylor Dunkin,Great App!,2020-01-08 01:06:11,"This app is basically an online diary...but better! You can reflect your feelings and emotions in a daily “story.” You are guided through the first part of the story where you are asked how the day was. You adjust how the day was by moving a notch along a scale. Next, it asks you why your day was good/bad/okay. You are given many options and another option being to make your own, if the ones given are not enough. Then, you can write your own entry if you feel the need to vent, or if you simply just want to talk about what happened during the day. Everything written can ONLY be viewed by you, so you don’t have to worry about privacy settings. Overall, I think this is a great app to keep track of your emotions in an organized fashion!",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I totally understand they have to make their money somewhere...😔 but another cool thing is you can lock it to were someone can only get in the app with your fingerprint👌🏼 amazing if you have either little siblings or children that want a peak in your life!! all in all this is a really good app and I would definitely recommend it🥰",5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I think this app overall is great. One of the features I like is the daily challenges. They are difficult but not so much that I feel distressed. Speaking of the daily challenge one of the down sides to this function is that the words are hard to read. The letters are a super light gray against a bright pink and orange background. It’s just a small accessibility grip. Other than that if you want to help build positive journaling habits I’d recommend this tooI. I rated this three stars because I saw a couple reviews stating that you could replace your therapist/counselor as the top reviews so I’m not really comfortable giving three stars to a company promoting a review like that.

It makes me check in with my feelings and let me know if I need to talk to someone. And if I have no one to talk to, I can just keep on typing paragraphs into Reflectly! And of course, the main part Reflectly has been impacting my life is that it’s been improving my writing skills and vocabulary.

I love the new updates as well, and don’t mind the timeline feature. One of the things I really enjoyed that I can’t seem to do anymore is change the date for journal entries. Sometimes I don’t get to journaling about my day until after midnight, and with this new update I’m not able to change the date so that my entry is logged under the day I’m writing about vs the day I actually write it on...if that makes sense.

toe knoee,I don’t get the hype,2020-09-20 13:49:22,"Maybe it’s because the app asks for you to give it a five star rating. I seriously don’t get the hype.

Inputting moments takes too long and involves eye strain for me because I can’t tell the colorless glyphs apart, there’s no way to search for them, and to top it off the keyboard autocorrect is always disabled. WHY?? 
The app’s main core functionality is to tell me that things I like make me happy and things I don’t like make me unhappy. But it only accounts for things I bother to put in with the clunky “moments” input system. I completely regret buying this because it literally just bothers me to tell it how I’m feeling so it can spit that information back at me and I can go “oh wow I never realized work was stressing me out,” “oh wow I never realized my hobbies make me happy.” Like seriously what is the actual point of this.

I’m so happy the previous titles we wrote have returned! Now we just need the pictures to attach to logs, daily questions, and the logging previous days!

It was originally a wonderful app. I would have given it a high rating, but then the update came. 

The biggest update consisted of: 
-Removing titles
-Removing pictures
-Removing daily question privileges
-Removing being able to log previous days
-Completely messing up the app I had known 

Now we can only post moments and pictures not linked to the moment. There’s no log anymore. It’s just moments. I’ve never had to write a negative review for an app before. I’ve never written a review for any app. I can’t believe that out of all the apps to let me down and make me write a review for it, it had to be this one. I was surprised when everything changed, but was shocked to see that lots of things were gone. Memories deleted. 
I’m planning to write in this app every single day and cherish my memories here. So are the tens of thousands of people that feel the same way about this update. If you want to be the #1 journal app, if you want your tens of thousands of people to be happy and preserve their memories, turn the app back to how it was.

Reflectly is basically a best friend that cares about you more than anything. I like going back throughout my days that I posted or wrote about and reading them wondering about what I did that day. It’s fun to just remember each day exactly. Reflectly is pretty much a friendly journal. A journal you can talk to and make friends with.

If you want to write more, it gives ample opportunity to do so, so you can spend as much of as little effort as you want on it, every day.

- A place to search all of my notes.

Next, none of the features were unlocked for me when I purchased the app i.e. it continued to ask me to purchase the app even after I did, and I wasn’t able to use any of the features I purchased. Lastly, I tried to contact support, which was a total joke. It directs you to contact support via Facebook messenger and when I did, I received no response. That’s right, there was zero response from the support team. So, now I’m out 60 bucks, can’t use the app, and support is virtually nonexistent. To say I’m extremely dissatisfied is to put it lightly. I regret ever downloading this app. I would highly recommend that anyone who chooses this app DOES NOT PURCHASE IT.  This is a SCAM. BUYER BEWARE!",1,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

You really can talk about your feeling and help get it off your shoulders! But I wish you didn’t have to pay to be able to get the full effect of this app. I do understand that a few things you may have to pay for, but a lot of it is locked unless you buy premium. I still absolutely love this app and it has helped me so much, being able to write down what I’m feeling and know I’m not alone is really comforting. The premium problem I mentioned is a bummer but it’s no big deal, if you really want it, it’s pretty affordable, but if it isn’t a necessary thing then there are still other great parts of this app to appreciate!",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
Larzodon,DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE FREE TRIAL,2020-02-01 04:54:43,"I thought this would be a great tool for the new year, however I stopped using it quickly. I caught the flu and I went a couple days over the week-long trial. I understand that I should have set a reminder in my phone and that it was my error, however what really upset me was that when I tried contacting them through email and Facebook (their only options for customer service), I never even received a reply. If the creators of this app were truly focused on bringing better mental health to the masses, they should start by having a human respond to their customers. $50 may be a drop in the bucket for them since they have thousands of paying subscribers, but for me, accidentally spending $50 on an app I found to be underwhelming is almost as frustrating as realizing a company that portrays itself to be “mindful” has no option of discourse for their customers at all.

I took senior pics on one day and got them back later and I just wanted them to be in the same place if you know what I mean. Also, I would really like to see quotes other than just the “inspirational” category.

Blossom_the_Dog,A great app,2020-03-16 01:25:08,I totally recommend this app for people who struggle remembering to go write in a paper diary. Let’s just admit we are always on our phones in the first place. 2 reminders pop up in a day so you can see it when you open your phone. The notifications are something you don’t get when you have a normal diary. It has lots of space to write just like a book. It asks you questions of the day and you can also add pictures. That has to be the best part of the whole thing. I love adding pictures from though out the day. BTW you can always go back to edit any day that you missed.

The only problem with it is that I feel like there is too many things only available to premium users. I know that is one of the only ways (for the app) to make money since it is a free app, but it’s a bit on the extreme side when it comes to accessibility.

So it would be really helpful if there was like a draft button. Like if you haven’t finished a story, you can click the draft button and it’ll save until you’ve finished it.

I can even log in on any device so I dont ever lose My data. The only minor issue for me is I would have to pay for premium just to get full access and i honestly feel like that throws me off a Little bit because customers should feel the need to want to come back and do more with the app. Getting part access is very limited based on how much you could actually do.

It’s great, it’s easy. At one point they switched formats but it was pretty simple to navigate the changes. But for the past few weeks I kept getting notifications telling me to upgrade to premium. every. single. time. i open the app. it’s so annoying. 

and then tonight, when i went to journal like i have every single night for the last nine months, i get a pop up telling me i can’t journal anymore unless i upgrade to premium (which has no set price, it seems to change every time i get a notification about it) tonight it was 15 dollars a month, which is something i just can’t do. 

i have 293 journal entries with reflectly. and just like that, on a whim, they decided i wasn’t worthy to be a user anymore. totally completely screwed me over. 293 entries that i have to transfer over to another app or to my notes app or something if i want to have access to them. it’s so incredibly messed up, and especially since it happened without warning.

My medication for my mental illness is expensive, my therapy is expensive, and sometimes my friends aren’t available. Why not have a completely free app where you can get what you need if you are feeling down? I thought that is what I was getting and clearly not. These people don’t care about our well being at all.

I logged into the app after thinking about how it could really help me to make a habit of writing more this year, and all of a sudden everything is payed? It’s not even charging $15 for the app itself, the $15 is a promotion and usually it’s $59 annually. It’s not even that great of a service, only really giving you a mood log and some quotes which can be found on free apps.

FuAdamShefter,Amazing App,2020-06-06 01:37:48,"** So i am editing this review after their newest update. I do not like that, before the update, you were given a daily question to make you REFLECT on your life. Now that they have updated it, they made that part if the app a premium only section. I think that is ridiculous. 

Its is so great to use. My only problem is that you can’t see your stats unless you have premium. The reason I have a problem with this is because before you unlock that part of the app, it leads you on that you will be able to see your stats no problem, when in reality you have to pay money for that. But I love how encouraging it is and it really actually helps me think about my day and process my feelings.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
Delaney Stiles,only nice if you pay up to $100,2020-12-31 22:26:54,"this app has a very good layout, you can customize the colors and you can choose what to submit each day. it’s very positive and I genuinely feel good when using the app. I got the app last night and suddenly it’s saying I need to pay $20 (which is supposed to be a sale price btw?) In order to get the “full experience”. I said “no thanks” and now it won’t let me do ANYTHING on the app for supposedly 24 hours or until I pay the premium subscription.
Maybe some people can afford this, but I have a minimum wage job and important things I need to save and spend my money on. This app is so expensive and i’d end up feeling guilty if I spent that much on it monthly.

The only reason is that Reflectly just had a pretty big update if I say so myself. And I liked most of it. You get to choose from a lot of emotions and it’s organized a lot better and more aesthetically pleasing. The only thing I’m disliking abt now is that it doesn’t give you your daily questions for free anymore. You have to buy the premium pack and Idk if maybe I’m just not seeing smthg but tbh it has me slightly upset cause I actually liked answering the questions.

Now, I’ve seen these things before but none quite as high as $15 which is a 75% discount! (Meaning the original price was $60) and honestly I felt like sad that all my emotional investment had be rudely shut down but yet another app you have to pay for!

It could suggest things to do when we’re down, or techniques to help us calm down. Or how to help us be more aware and knowledgeable of our feelings. It’s not bad though! I like it and it’s helped.

I ended up paying for two months where I thought it was canceled. Though I think the app itself is a great tool to help your mental health, I was not happy with how the subscription worked.

Customization

With customization, you can change your color theme. Bunch of colors to choose from within the app. It also has dark mode and light mode, as well as changing ur ‘profile’ picture. I love it!

Purchases

You can use the app for free without paying. It’s a very well made app, not nothing cheesy or cheap. It does have a VIP pass you can buy monthly, yearly, or for a lifetime. I haven’t bought that yet but it does unlock some cool features, but the non-paid version works just fine for me.

NothinTooBig,Psychological Backing,2020-11-11 00:09:39,"This app allows the user to document their emotions and daily events. The mindfulness that’s promoted through daily journaling while focusing on and encouraging users to becoming happier everyday, makes it easier to see patterns in thoughts and behaviors interfering with this goal. This reinforced paradigm shift actually starts to shift the users mindset and allows the self assessment of mood and events to become more positive. It also bridges the time between therapy appointments for patients and creates a log for events or emotional states that can be discussed at a later time. The encouraging daily quotes and relaxing or pleasing images is positive reinforcement of the goal to become happier.",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
123kittypower,I don’t like the new update,2020-05-27 00:37:13,"I really like Reflectly before the update it was easy for me to journal without a hassle and the daily questions were awesome to reflect on my life. Now with the new update  its not only hard to work and understand but the features I loved such as the daily question you have to pay for which I can’t afford to pay the fees to go on premium. I really enjoyed this app but it’s sad that I can’t do it anymore please bring the old version back.

I ended up deleting the app and losing many amazing memories and downloaded Daylio, this is an amazing app which is similar to the old version of Reflectly and allows you to edit previous days, it even gives you data on what moods you feel the most you month in colors and much more.

I’m not really comfortable talking to someone I know or having to pay someone to listen to me vent or express myself.

The only complaint I have is the app has a very annoying bug where occasionally when I try to save the app will freeze and I will loose my journal for that day. This happens twice a week or so. It’s quite annoying to have to write out passages multiple times.

This app calms me in general and those two things make me feel awesome. I can always come to refelectly to tell about my bad day and I always feel somewhat better! 🤍 I love how you can add things like emotions and what lead to those emotions. I also love how it has calming quotes and notifications of calming quotes too. It’s never pressuring like duolingo. For example it’s like “do your Spanish lessons!” It pressures me. This politely asks you and calms you somehow while. 🤍🤍 I suggest you get this! 😚,5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Gimmie989,Not everyone has a weekend,2020-08-22 14:41:07,"This app asks you to pour your heart out but then it will tell you in the morning motivation that because it’s a Saturday you could spend all day in your pajamas!

Earth to non-essential workers: Not everyone has a weekend! I have worked Saturdays most of my adult career. Not everyone hates their job so much that they have to celebrate hump day! 

The mascots blinking eyes are comforting enough to answer the moment prompts & the support articles are well thought out and well written.

 The notifications are good - they ask you to motivate yourself each morning for a good day. And in the evening they ask you to reflect how your day went. Because both my husband and I are essential workers we often don’t talk about this each night. One night when reflecting with RefIectly I realized no one else had asked me how the day went. For that I give thanks!

One small note - developers, can you add the ability to move around the little actives and feelings buttons so that we can organize them as we would like? If I add new ones that I like to use often, they are way over on the right and I have to scroll to them every time.

big_activity,This app is pointless garbage,2020-12-28 14:59:46,"I saw an ad that said it had AI journaling questions so i assumed it was like a chat bot that asked you questions to help you reflect, which is what the ad suggested. It said it was personalized for your experience.

None of that is true. I couldn’t even access the app to try it out and accidentally purchased a whole year subscription — it wouldn’t allow me to change the length of subscription— and it’s definitely not worth the money. It’s misleading and is honestly completely pointless.

For check-ins, it just asks you how you’re feeling and gives you only a few options to choose from. I can’t easily figure out how to change the options. It also only gives me a few options for saying my emotions about the situation. Nothing is personalized and it feels very cookie-cutter. 

It doesn’t send anything interesting during the day. When you set reminders, it just sends you boring quotes that are found on magnets or motivational posters. It has a “morning motivation” but it was seriously just “clean your room”. What? Not helpful. 

Save your money and don’t waste your time on this. I have no idea how the rating is so high.",1,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

     It’s very simple, basic colors and setup. (Which I actually like) But I’m thinking already that they may need more options for the “moods” & “why” section. There are a few that will never apply to me; wish I could put in ones that would help me.

Everything is held back behind the barrier of payment, which honestly I think it’s a very disgusting thing to do, especially when people are trying to express their feelings on an app that won’t let them do so accurately.

I could easily get another free app and it would be fine, or even just write in one of my many real journals. I’ve always preferred this app but this is just too much for me.

MizzMagicKid,It’s ok,2021-03-06 16:38:26,"I have a few problems with this app
1. It’s kinda boring to use. I mean, I know it’s supposed to be a journal app, but maybe you should add some fun stuff.

2. The premium. Most games have an optional payment, but most apps don’t. This is one of them. I know you “nEeD tO mAkE mOnEy” but not everyone has the money to afford it. It gives you one free day. ONE. Then the next day, you have to pay the premium. That just makes less people want to use this. Why do you even HAVE a premium in the first place? ITS A JOURNAL APP. The journal apps I’ve had didn’t have premium.
Over all, this app is okay. I don’t recommend it to people who aren’t willing to pay for a premium.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Gage of the time I have been putting food because their is no none option or what ever other option I needed. And it’s very limited in the options. So maybe if it gave us more options and asked some more questions if you put you where down or something it would be a better app. But it’s cute and great.

You can track your emotions and do other things. I really like this app so far and if any parent is asking about age appropriate I think it is perfectly fine. Nothing inappropriate or anything.

something too listen too you, or so you can just right out all of your issues, without having someone criticize you. I’ve only had this app for around 2 days, and I already feel better.

Also, for the stories, they seem extremely childish and dumbed down for the free version.

But do you really think they’re going to pay for something like that? 
I came to this app seeking a way to help myself with my own mental problems and my feelings. Unfortunately, all I can do is document what I’m experiencing. I can’t buy the premium. But, I mean, I guess it still helps to write everything I’m feeling down. But I could’ve just used google docs for that, not some app from the App Store. 

If you really needed money, just put some adds in and offer a way to remove them, not add a premium version with tons of other features that could help those who need it.

The “select all” feature of the little copy/paste menu is inexplicably missing when I try to select what I’ve written.

...alright...
I’d try it again-
Same thing...
I’d wait an hour or so...
Same thing...
I’d wait a day, a couple, even a week...
Same. Thing.

Every time I come back, I feel like there’s another amazing feature. However, it seems that each one also comes with a setback.

At first, it was simple: just journal as you please. Then, they introduced photos. (One suggestion: just as you can set a journal entry for any day in the past, this should be available for photos, too.)

Just recently, I checked onto the app again to make an entry only to realize that I can’t. That’s right. No more Reflectly Premium - just Reflectly or no Reflectly. That’s it. Reflectly has reserved almost every single feature of their app for Premium users only.

I rate this app 2 stars because although it has some awesome things about it, the fact that they’ve focused their intents so much on money leads me to the conclusion that they’re no longer concerned with the actual mental health of their users, exactly what they claim to care about most.",1,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Wank All Day,Refused to let me journal,2021-02-02 14:51:33,"I began journaling during November of last year. I decided on reflectly because I enjoyed the aesthetic and daily quotes it would provide me with. Once the new year started they prevented me from using the application due to having a special “new year sale” which ended up being their entire marketing scheme. aight I had known that my writing would only be a trial that would have been fine, but to try and make it out as a sale that would infinitely refresh itself until purchase is despicable. Eventually they even prevented me from seeing my old entries to even attempt to recover my precious memories that had been stored here.

monofang,"Super glitchy, unfortunately",2020-04-09 05:44:44,"I'm in love with the concept and design of this app - I just wish there weren't so many errors consistently.. 

I bought a month subscription to try it out, and immediately couldn't seem to make a new account. I had to reboot the app 3 times before it took. 

Then once I was in, I tried to write my first entry and it wouldn't let me. 

Finally, I did - and I went back to edit the notes I wanted to include; but once I tried to hit save, the app again said there was an error and I lost my notes. :/ 

I'm disappointed to say the least. This is why I think these types of apps should have a trial period. I feel taken advantage of; after I pay my subscription (in order to initially experience the app, you must)it barely functions correctly. 

I hope it gets corrected soon; the idea of Reflectly is really neat and I'd love to immerse myself in it once it's functioning.

     I only had Reflectly for a week now but yeah. Just wanted to share. Overall, a really good app. :D",4,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

The app seems to understand me and keeps track every day so i can see if I am getting better and getting worse. It also provides the time so you can see what time you usually feel sad at. The app also allows you to explain what might be making you mad or sad and lets you explain EXACTLY how you feel! This app is so worth getting,5,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

And I’ve been using this app for at least a year and I loved this app. But I went to go write because 2020 is over in less than half an hour and 2021 is a really big year for me and now it’s telling me I have to get a subscription to write anymore. So now I have to find a different app because I can’t write again without paying for it.

The least they could do is let you try it for a week AND THEN ask you to get a premium account in order to keep using it. Because in one day you don’t really get much, you get an idea base on few things they tell you and show you.

After a week of journaling through this app I’m already finding a better ability to separate myself from the voices within me that create those feelings of anxiety.

The way they’ve created it makes it so easy use and the reminders they have are very helpful. Not annoying at all like some other wellness apps. Just download it and use it as the free version, I’m sure you’ll upgrade just because you WANT to give these guys some money for what they’ve done here.

I find the approach to Reflectly and the way questions are oriented to be kind of childlike and at times very pointed/judgmental.

I set it up and saw which options were available for free and they seemed suitable for what I’d be using it for. The limit you on your journal entries which was fine with me as I don’t have the time for that every day. 

Except, you answer the few questions they give you and you are treated with a page telling you all the great feature of Premium... with no way to exit out of it to go back to the home page. I’ve opened the app several times now and have gotten stuck at the “But wait, there’s more!” Ad. 

Had to uninstall. Ultimately, I don’t think this should be on a monthly subscription, Fairly priced? Yes. I’d pay about $9.99 for an app like this. Not a monthly subscription however.

Sometimes I look in my old journal (a real journal) and go to the app and jot it down because I loved that I can add cute or funny pictures to express myself... but now it’s in the moment .. so I can’t edit the date.. and i would sometimes write the next day or 12:00 am so it’ll say it is the next day when it’s actually yesterday.. 

And not to be like that I know it’s y’all app but it’s no where close to better... the last format is what made your app your app.. I use to recommend all my friends to this app because they would be like oooh what’s that? And now it’s sad I’m sorry...

-Its easy to use. 
-Its welcoming.
-Theres no ads. 
-Its nice to write stuff down if you

-Its one of those apps that you 
need to buy and purchase things to 
get what the app offers. 

I understand that when you buy an app, your going to have to purchase things within the app. I know that. But still, if theres someone out there that just wants somewhere where they can write down their thoughts so they feel like they are being listened to. Or if theres someone who just needs to know what their emotions are but checking this app to tell them, then by all means they should have access to that.

I did buy the year subscription because I thought it was a good decision for myself in general.

Pros
- personal
- slightly customizable in terms of general aesthetic and design.
- easy ui nothing over the top
- simple and clean with a splash of color
Cons
- the image integration isn’t great it’s a bit lack luster (it’s nice but not quite there just yet)
- moods and reason behind them are varied but few in comparison 
- no icon search bar for when set a new mood or reason

now, after the update, there isn’t any part of the app that works without premium. now i can’t journal anymore, so i’ve had to download a new app to keep up my progress. this app is basically not free anymore, and i would much recommend Daylio, journaling is free there, and it works pretty much the same as reflectly. please give non-premium users their journaling back.",1,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

kelsbelsssss,5 Months of Journaling Lost With New Update,2020-05-13 07:53:45,"If this is user error, I’ll have to accept that. 

But after updating, Reflectly said it didn’t recognize my email. I went ahead and created a new account to see if I could solve the issue. No where I’m creating a new account does it prompt you to create an email and password. But once I went on the ‘Account’ homepage, that’s where it shows a button that says “Create An Account”, something I don’t think I did when I downloaded it 5 months ago because I didn’t realize that was a separate step. 

I’m devastated to think that 5 months of journaling is gone. Journaling and reflecting that meant so much to me. That I can’t look back on and see my concrete progress. 

Reflectly should make creating a login and password actually a part of creating an account.

The quotes are good but apart from the mood check ins and reminders that’s about all you’re going to get from the app. Other options are to be payed for, and that’s besides the initial yearly fee, which to be fair is a good price. 

Morning motivation section is choices and has only one option for all categories, pretty weak in my opinion. Seems a little lazy and uninspired considering all that could be offered for motivation.

This is an app that asks you a reflection question every day, and allows you to write down how your day went. It offers inspirational quotes and statistics on how your mood check-ins have gone. I thought this app was going great until I was only able to do TWO moos check-ins, then it said I have to pay. I think that’s genuinely so dumb, it should give you so much more time.

The subscription is something like 1.50 a month so it’s barely anything but I just wanted to let everyone know that you literally will not be able to use this app without paying.

a socialist who hates himself,not super impressed,2020-03-01 07:26:50,"so far it seems like it’s in beta-testing, rather than an already published app. for example, when you go to make a new entry there’s an error where they couldn’t decide between saying hello and hi so both scripts run at once every time, and it has a little fight where it blinks between one and the other really fast. i think it might actually need an epilepsy warning because it goes on for about 30-45 seconds. also the blue color in the nighttime mode is this weird washed out navy color, they should have made the background one of the colors they let you pick out in the preview. i’ll probably try some of the alternatives.",3,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Mili!!!!!,Good but...,2020-05-15 00:02:41,It’s really good once you write your first story you feel really good about the app and how it asks you all these questions. But after doing 6 stories it unlocks your stats but you can’t see your stats unless you do the monthly payment. That’s the sucky part about this to me.

the statistics, quotes, and other additional features are also super helpful. it’s not pressurizing and doesn’t send you annoying notifications every second to come check in.

It’s a good app to vent to and let everything out that you have been holding throughout the day. I think it’s more of a diary app that asks you questions. 
Cons:
My issue is that you may have to spend money. You want to check your stats? Money. Hotel? Travago. It shouldn’t cost money to do that and I think they are doing it for money and not benefit of their customers. I think they should think a little more about what costs money.
