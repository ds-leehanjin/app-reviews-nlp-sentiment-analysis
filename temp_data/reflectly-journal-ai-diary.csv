5,"This app is very good at its job; and I’ve only been using it for a day. Even though you have to pay for somethings still, it’s not getting in the way of you using the app. At all really. Are use the free version and it’s still great. Like with some other apps you have to bye like pretty much the entire thing to be able to use the app and if you don’t want to buy it then it’s pretty much just getting in the way of you using the app in its entirety. Which is quite annoying (specially in the fact that that’s pretty much every app out there). I am only reading this app five stars because of what I’ve seen so far. I haven’t been using it for that long clearly, but it still seems to be working. I love how you can customize pretty much the entire thing just to your liking. It is very good with letting you speak without caring. Like when you sometimes need to just talk but you can’t talk to specific people or you just feel like you can’t talk to specific people; yes well now you can. I love how you can just speak into it and not even care. Very good tool for remembering your thoughts and how you felt. Sometimes in the moment you don’t quite remember all of the things that happened to you and that day that you would like to remember and sometimes writing it down just doesn’t quite cut it. Anyways overall this app seems to be pretty good. It’s cute, it makes me feel good about myself, and makes me feel happy overall. I would recommend this app to a friend.",Great!,magtb,2021-02-01 16:54:36,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
5,"I reached out to the reflectly team to get help for my issue below and Nicole reached out to me with a very supportive response and was able to immediately fix the issue and get me my membership. I really appreciated this and am happy to be starting my new year with this app! Thank you again! 

I downloaded the app and it immediately asked for a year subscription, I was interested and decided to buy. It purchased and had me do my first log of my mood. I did that and everything was great! But then it asked me to create an account so I typed in my email address and it said this is already in use, maybe try signing in? So I backed out of the app to go back to the home page where i could sign in and I signed in successfully. But I checked my account and not only is my first log missing but the subscription was missing and it said ""basic plan active"" so I was confused and clicked on the ""activate reflectly"" and clicked redeem offer to see if when it connects to my apple account it will recognize I have already paid for the subscription. Well it didn't and charged me again because I got a text from my credit card saying I was charged another $63 but the app said ""error occurred"" and never gave me the subscription anyway! Point is I have two payments of this year subscription and no subscription. Please help",Updated review!,Kk11114,2021-01-02 17:27:07,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
4,"I love Reflectly. The UI is absolutely gorgeous, the animations are slick, and the whole app is great to use. The check-ins are great, and the voice notes and photos are also a great addition. I love adding a photo or two that highlight my day. The app’s been doing a lot for me, and I love it. However, there are a few improvements that could make it even better. First, the iPad app is pretty bad. It works, but there’s no trackpad support, so things are still pretty awkward. The text formatting is awkward (there’s no cursor, so you don’t really know where you’re typing). I’d like to see a more advanced text editor for journaling with rich text formatting, inline image support, different (preset?) text sizes, bullet lists, the works. After all- the app costs $60/year. Apple Pencil support would be wonderful, it would be great to have a hybrid journal with typed entries in addition to handwritten entries. Support for scribble would also be a welcome improvement. Another great improvement would be the ability to add videos along with images. I’m unsure if Reflectly is already encrypted, but it would be a great idea to include the option to encrypt your journal and its entries with a custom key like Jour does.","Great app with beautiful UI, but improvements are welcome.",thecommamaster,2021-01-03 05:16:08,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
5,"Lets start off with how AMAZING this app is! This app calms me down when i do check-ins and lets me kind of express my feelings when there is nothing to express them too. I also love the inspirational quotes i get everyday, and how i get to chose how many times a day i get them ( I personally set mine to 8 x a day)! And i love how i can view my stats , i also love how you get to CHOSE if you pay for premium and if you don't you still get let into your app and get to experience other features unlike other apps.. and to end off my review it is amazing and i definitely recommend it ! Its not like other diaries and then again keeps me calm because Reflectly asks me questions that if i was writing in my diary i would just be straight forward, wright about it and be done! But here they ask you questions so its like talking to a person but now having secrets and people talking about it and sharing things that happened to you when its none of there business( i experience that alot).

1,"I’ve had this app since i believe January of last year, and i started heavily using it during lockdown for covid and it helped me manage my thoughts and feelings and it became easier to progressively work through them. I was most of all enjoying the morning motivation, and for the end of the day check-in, it would ask a question of the day which was my absolute favorite part. However, in this most recent update, I’m unable to do either of these things without paying for a subscription. The only thing i can do for free is look at past entries and view the quotes page. What I don’t understand is if the purpose of the app is to journal, why do i have to pay to do it? And so suddenly too? It’s like a music streaming app offering music you can listen to for free and after your 3rd song, they make you shell out some cash if you want to keep listening to music. I wish they would consider going back to the original format, im sure most people would pay for the premium subscription, and then people who are satisfied with the free version can continue to use the app. It’s disappointing because I was really enjoying this app and how it was helping me and now i’m forced to find something else that’s suitable for me mentally and financially.",You have to pay to do anything.,JessiBallard,2021-01-12 21:34:04,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,"{'id': 20520412, 'body': 'Hi there JessiBallard 👋\r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to review the app.\r\nI´m so sorry that you’ve had an unfortunate experience with Reflectly.

5,"I have always been skeptical with mental health apps just because if you think about it, how can an app help me with my problems. This app does just that! In the morning you get one simple motivating task to do so you can get your day started off right and throughout the day when you feel the need to talk about your feelings you can. At night you have a prompt to help you better understand your problems. One thing that really has helped me is the notifications. That might sound weird but during the day the app will send you quotes and personally quotes like that inspire me to be better and I really like being able to choose ones that you relate to the most. After about five days of using the app to tells you about your feelings and if your getting better or not and other things.

1,"I haven’t used the app for too long, but I already love it! All of the basic features are perfect for me, and the AI is marvelous!

However, there are some serious problems with the app. Something that frustrates me significantly is your promotions for buying the full version of the app. I have no intention of purchasing the additional features because I cannot afford the full price once the promotion expires. What makes me angry is how I can’t even do my check ins, and I’m confused about what I can get for free. Every time I try to do a check-in, the promotion pops up. There is clearly something wrong with the app, because all of the top reviews are clearly from people who paid for the app, but there are other reviewers that are saying the same thing that I’m saying. Some older reviews even say that there were more features in the past, but you now have to pay for everything. If you are intentionally doing this, that is unacceptable. However I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt.

4,"I have mental health problems, so my therapist recommend I try to use a mood tracking app. I was worried, as I don’t usually follow through and use these regularly. But the feature to have it check in multiple times a day, and to send positive remarks is an AWESOME feature.
However, I have a variety of mental health issues, and do understand that a company has to make their money. But the “positivity reminders” are limited to relatively random issues in the basic version. Anxiety, autism, wisdom are available, which I think is awesome. But a large client base is going to have depression and stress problems as well. If those options had tiers, it may be more affective for a wider audience of users. That would be willing to pay for those better options after seeing if the reminders are actually helpful. 
I know there’s a trial, I just don’t think 3 days is enough time to see any actual mentality differences. 
Overall, really like the app. Just wish it was a bit more widely usable for different issues without in-app purchases.","Best App so far, Minus in app-purchase",khaotickams,2021-02-04 17:56:58,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
5,"in all my years of having apple products i’ve never once written a review for an app. but this app... this... app... is the best journaling app i’ve ever downloaded. i’d been trying to get into consistently journaling for a few years now but nothing never really stuck, until i found this. i will admit, if you just have the free version it’s not worth it. paying ~$1.25 a month for this is a game changer. i write it in probably 3 times a day or whenever I’m feeling something/need to get words off my chest.
you can track your mood, what’s making you feel that way, and emotion you’re feeling. 
it gives you daily motivational quotes whenever you need them, however many times a day you’d like. 
the user interface is BEAUTIFUL and incredibly easy to navigate. i will recommend this app to any and everybody i know.

1,"I downloaded this app back in April. And I liked it because it was a place where I can write my thoughts out. Around December 26, I went to write in a journal entry and it would let me do anything if I didn’t go premium. I don’t know if this is a bug or it’s going to be permanent. Or they are doing this because they want people to spend money so that they can have money, so that the users can have a basic function like journaling. Or some users are just using the basic plan, like me, and they need or want extra money. I started to really like this app because it did the basic functions. But it doesn’t even allow you journal. How can an app that is meant for journaling not allow its users to journal without paying. I switched to Daylio and I fell like it’s better. You can actually do something’s that you couldn’t do on Reflectly like look at statics, even allows you to create goals for yourself. It has some features that Reflectly doesn’t have. I’m not telling that you should switch to Daylio. But I’m just saying that this has worked for me and I don’t really have any issues with it.

You can customize the background to the color you like the most, and can do however many mood check-in’s you want at any time during the day. There is only one thing I am not a fan of with this app. I am aware everyone needs to make money and this app might be what puts food on the table for some people, but I don’t get why the membership has to be so expensive. First they give you the option for $15 dollars a year, which is acceptable, but they cut it down from $60 dollars? The features in the membership aren’t even that great, but there are a lot of them, which makes using Reflectly without the membership a lot less fun.

I also like how it’s so cute like the little face that it shows helps me feel a little better and it will give you inspirational quotes and will try and help cheer you up. I first seen this on instagram and said “Maybe it won’t be so bad and will help” and I think it did. I may be young like younger than 14 but I do have lots of problems at school and home, and telling someone or something my problems makes me feel a little better. I personally think that talking through technology or paper is easier than talking in real life face to face with another, some stuff that also helps me is Minecraft, anime, gacha, and drawing.

1,"I know this app is supposed to help improve mental health, but it’s doing the opposite for me. One big problem is that, within the app, there’s a timer counting down to when a special deal for premium runs out, and I’m scared of timers. There’s no way to close it; it’s always there, quietly counting down. Another problem is that it gives you a daily task. The one I got was to “say no to something you usually say yes to”. I was anxious the entire day because I didn’t know what I was going to say no to. I almost decided to say no to one of my meals since I’m overweight, but luckily, I had the brilliant idea to say no to the challenge instead. The third thing that makes me anxious is that it won’t let you journal after your free trial ends. Instead, it pushes you to get premium in order to use the CORE FEATURE of the app! This was the last straw that caused me to delete the app after less than 48 hours. It seems as though this app cared more about money than the well-being of its customers.

4,"I have had Reflectly for over a year now and I will say that it is very personal for me. My Reflectly has been an outlet for all the strife in my life. I love the UI. It’s very user-friendly. You can add pictures to the days you write your reflections on, and it even helps you actually reflect and think about things in your life by asking you a question every day for you to answer. There’s no pressure to write entries, make pictures or write the answers to the questions. 

I have been through the hurricanes that nearly destroyed our custody and relationship issues, people taking advantage of us when we were in need, a shooting, family issues, accidental overdose resulting in seratonin issues and hallucinations, severe sickness, creepy hillbillies trying to mess with us, and of course the political climate of 2020...and because of this I have severe anxiety. Reflectly has a a friendly UI and non-agitating color scheme. They’ve only ever really made changes to it once that I can recall. 

     I recommended features to Reflectly and they actually communicated with me on Facebook messenger rather promptly. Come to find out, you can download your Reflectly in a PDF. The only drawback is that it messes up the parts where you separated your paragraphs, which is why for now my review is four stars. I think they actually listen to our concerns so it should be fixed soon. I’ll go back and check just to be sure.

3,"I liked the app at the start, but I downloaded it so that I could have something to record and reflect my feelings on, basically to use it for what it’s for. But I don’t like how after a few days you have to pay to keep journaling..I don’t have a credit card, and I already know that nobody in my family is going to pay for an app subscription for me. It stressed me out just to go on today and find out that I couldn’t let my feelings out and journal because I had to accept a deal to continue. I don’t care about the premium features or whatever it is, I just wanted something to write my feelings in that had less of a risk of being found by my family. 

The app is good, it’s the fact that if you want to continue using it to keep you mentally stable you have to pay a fee. That doesn’t make sense to me.

Now if you want to do anything you have to pay a lot of money. Therefore this app is useless now! I understand they have to make money but why lock everything behind a pay wall?

Problem is, to get stats on your week and average feelings, or journal prompts, you have to pay monthly. This is an amazing app no matter what, and I get that you have to make income, but maybe extend the things to maybe some journal prompts are free and others aren’t.

Perfect. I’m pretty sure you can do way more with premium, but since I don’t have that I’m gonna talk about the cons of this app. 
1. It basically only has 4
Options. A mood check in, voice note, and the ads a picture. I did a mood check in, thinking it would tell me something new everyday. For example if I write in the description. “I cried.” I thought maybe it would say something like “crying is healthy.” “Your strong.” But once you do the mood check in, it doesn’t really do anything.

I experienced a loss and stopped using reflectly, but my New Years resolution included getting back to using Reflectly daily to try preventing another depressive episode. But no... it seems like I need a subscription now. Not everyone has the money to pay monthly, but everyone deserves the option to have an organized journal of thoughts and feelings.

1,"I’ll preface this by saying I’ve had Reflectly for a couple years now, and though I haven’t used it as much as I probably could have, I’ve enjoyed the times that I have. Every time I come back, I feel like there’s another amazing feature. However, it seems that each one also comes with a setback.

At first, it was simple: just journal as you please. Then, they introduced photos. (One suggestion: just as you can set a journal entry for any day in the past, this should be available for photos, too.)

Just recently, I checked onto the app again to make an entry only to realize that I can’t. That’s right. No more Reflectly Premium - just Reflectly or no Reflectly. That’s it. Reflectly has reserved almost every single feature of their app for Premium users only.

I rate this app 2 stars because although it has some awesome things about it, the fact that they’ve focused their intents so much on money leads me to the conclusion that they’re no longer concerned with the actual mental health of their users, exactly what they claim to care about most.",Used to be a helpful app...,NoahForPresident,2021-01-02 01:57:08,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

It distorts their legacy and who they were. This quote is actually the opposite of everything Anaïs Nin wrote about. She wrote about sensuality, enjoying life’s pleasures, and going deep.

The quotes are good but apart from the mood check ins and reminders that’s about all you’re going to get from the app. Other options are to be payed for, and that’s besides the initial yearly fee, which to be fair is a good price.

This is an app that asks you a reflection question every day, and allows you to write down how your day went. It offers inspirational quotes and statistics on how your mood check-ins have gone. I thought this app was going great until I was only able to do TWO moos check-ins, then it said I have to pay. I think that’s genuinely so dumb, it should give you so much more time.

after starting college, i began feeling ovewhelmed and needed a place to voice my thoughts that was simple and easy. i chose this app and, although a ton of features were locked behind the paywall, i was content with journaling whenever i needed to, whether it was to relieve stress or jot down important moments. 

i opened the app today to write a new entry for new year's, and i was appalled that i now had to have premium to continue journaling. this is uncalled for and i have lost any respect i ever had for this greedy little piece of crap. i suppose i'll just delete this app and go back to traditional pen and paper journaling.

3,"So I really like this idea but only on day three, I’ve maxed out all my free journals apparently. I didn’t know that I had a limited amount of journals so I kinda just did them whenever I wanted to. I’m a little sad too that there aren’t that many quote options that are free. I’d be great if you could select multiple types of quotes so you could get them all in your stream and personally, I think the sections of quotes that are sensitive like eating disorders should be unlocked for ppl who have that and don’t know how to get help. Honestly an overall great app and the price with all the discounts isn’t really that bad. I just wish there was a way to unlock stuff with like time or activities so people who can’t pay can still get all the qualities of this app. Because I’ve maxed out my journals, I really don’t know if I’ll be able to use the app anymore because I don’t have the ability to pay for now. Later, I’ll update and see where I’m at if the free journals come back or if I pay for it.

Update: after looking at other reviews it seems this app was better before the update. I didn’t know the app before, but I know that the way it is is asking for so much money that I cant do a simple journal entry. I’ll probably have to delete it and find a different journal. It’s such a good app but everything is locked :(

Update: there are plenty of other journal apps with a basic unpaid version that seems to be better than this one’s, so I will be using those instead. I’d rather not have to spend money to do something that should be free like writing. Hopefully the people who made this app can think of a more friendlier way to help people and earn profit.",I could only do stuff 5 times,I love Dem pigs,2021-01-04 21:20:12,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

4,"I have to track my emotions daily for my therapist, and this app has been really helpful. The clean, aesthetic design and the little clicks when you finish a note really help to incentivize mood-tracking. 

The only thing I would want to change is some of the user interface. Specifically, setting up new activities/emotions is awkward; instead of having to archive them if you want to make any changes, I feel like you should be able to edit the ones you’ve added in your settings so you can change the name or icon. I also think it would be nice to have the option to change the icons for pre-existing activities/feelings, or even archive the ones that aren’t relevant to your life. FINALLY! I think you should be able to choose multiple categories for the quotes you can get, but that might just be in the paid version, I’m not sure. Because of all this, I’m rating it a four out of five stars. This is a beautifully built, satisfying app, so these little issues end up standing out. 

I also have some suggestions. The lack of these features isn’t detrimental, but I think they could go a long way in improving the app. First, it would be great to have a simple goal tracker. I’ve seen these in other journaling apps and I can’t help but want them on your app. It wouldn’t have to be much, just a simple list of goals, maybe you could go in and press a button to say if you’ve succeeded. A second suggestion — you should be able to write quotes to yourself! I find the pre-existing quotes don’t really work for me, and I would love to write myself messages that I know I will need to hear in the future. 

I will also say that I think the price of the full version is a little much for what this app is, but since the free version isn’t too restrictive and doesn’t have ads, it’s not something I’ll complain too much about or take away stars over.","Great app, but could use some UI tweaks",lunarsimulation,2021-03-04 20:45:21,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

4,"Hello developers of Reflectly, 
I’ve been using your app for a while, and feeling Hello developers of Reflectly, 
I’ve been using your app for a while, and feeling little bit more better managing my emotions reading positive affirmations, check in my recording my mood, and so on and so forth. Some things which could be improved is include more emotions, and unfamiliar emotions when logging to check in with how you’re feeling. There isn’t good selection of moods or emotions so I would appreciate if there’s a feature to record down the emotion or add way more moods, and unfamiliar moods. 

Another one is many developers who makes apps includes subscriptions, and I appreciate the discount to pay per year. I think it would be more fair if there’s one time payment that’s not overly priced, and affordable, there are people still out there who can’t stand subscriptions, and instead of complaining I use the free features, and it would’ve nice if you include a one time payment which is affordable to get access to all the features. 

Overall it’s a well built app, although I like to recommend the developer if we could customize, or add our own images we get from the internet to our own liking for positive affirmations, and customizing your profile where every iOS users sees an image of their profile picture, and other wonderful things on the app. It’s a really well made app and I’m glad there are people who actually cares for peoples mental, and emotional well being.",Incredible app for nurturing your mental and emotional well being + some feedback,VictoriaSilvis,2021-06-19 22:15:19,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

1,"I’m not one to make negative reviews. I understand making an app takes a lot of time and dedication, and I only rated this two stars because up until three days ago I loved this app. It made me feel productive and more relaxed once I went over my day. I LOVED IT. However, I guess with the new update, now we have “limited space” to journal. That is really frustrating because we already don’t have all the features for free, and now you take away the free journaling altogether? That’s pretty lame. I don’t want to spend $59.99 a MONTH just to have an app about journaling. I understand you need to make money as developers but come on! I loved your app because it provided a good service FOR FREE, and now it doesn’t. Simple as that. Get this app. Go ahead. But just know time is going to run out and you’ll have to pay to journal with no perks. I loved Reflectly, now I hate it.

The look and feel of it is really nice, and I just generally love the aesthetic and all the little things you can do with the little emotes in mood check-ins. However, I wish that reflections weren’t locked behind a paywall, but I do still love the app though, especially the reflections. I love that it gives you a more specific question to think about and write something about that isn’t just “How are you?”, and I wish I could use it more because it generally puts me in a better mood.Overall, love the app and would recommend, even if just for keeping your thoughts straight like I use it for.","Great app, but the paywall is a little irritating",bcnsbcbs,2021-05-30 22:44:23,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
1,"First, they charged me $30 for a premium subscription when I first opened the app. (Quick background, I'm a 32 year old engineer and understand how to use an iPhone, but still somehow accidentally paid for a year long subscription.) After two days of not being able to use the app, I was finally able to create an account and log my first journal entry. 

As soon as I finished, I was offered a ""special deal"" for a now $60 premium subscription marked down from some even more absurd amount. After turning that scam offer down, I was finally able to use the app from the main menu. Only to find out that I had apparently only paid for a basic membership, which I was under the impression was free. That's when I noticed the ""just for you"" button with a heart at the top of the screen.

Well, just for me, was another offer for a premium membership.... This time a little cheaper at only $18 for an annual membership. Clearly this raised some concerns so I found the settings/menu of the app - which confirmed that I only had a basic membership, contrary to my credit card statement that clearly shows a $29.99 charge. I immediately went to my subscriptions through my apple ID to see what that said and, of course, it showed that I have a premium account. Go figure. Now, not only did I have a premium account, I had a $60/year premium account. That was the final red flag for me. 

I'll be filling a complaint with the app store and immediately notifying my credit card company of this fraudulent charge. 

I came here for help. I'm extremely disappointed. I strongly suggest not submitting your mental health to this.",Scam,HeneRJ1000,2021-05-20 02:56:16,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Never thought I’d be writing a review but here we are, reflectly let me start by saying helped me through my anxiety. I had anxiety problems since 2020 September, 9, 2020. What involved me into anxeity was because of the 9/11 attack, me being myself I looked up on that day about 9/11 on YouTube. I watched these movies trying to make a remake of the movie, I watched clips and it made my brain at the time feel sad but never scared. That night, I couldn’t sleep I never new why or what it could be cause I can always sleep. I also had no sugar that night, it was strange. I kept breathing heavily but I didn’t notice it, I couldn’t sleep for a long time till I had to take a sleep pill. I was shaking and it was bad. This anxiety lasted for 2-4 days. I tried looking up calming videos on YouTube but they actually never helped me once, not even a little. I this staying up late messed up my beautiful sleep schedule to the point where I almost stayed up all night. It was bad, I was flunking school and on top of it with covid 19 I thought this was the new me. Luckly I never had a anxiety attack. I started looking up apps to help me sleep and then I came across reflectly. I downloaded it then tried it, I started to written my feelings and I saw quotes. They helped me calm down. They also had friendly calming reminders for me when I needed it through the day. I do recommend reflectly because not only did it help my health, but it’s kind of fun! After a few days of the app my anxiety faded away 
thankfully. Thank you reflectly, I appreciate your help. 5 stars ⭐️.","Reflectly helped me, no joke.",viralvillan6,2021-02-02 22:33:32,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

1,I used this app to periodically journal my thoughts and monitor my moods and experiences so I was shocked when I logged in after a few months to see it was paywalled and now the app is forcing you to pay a 59.99 premium for a journaling app. That is appalling and the price is unreasonable for the service.

I have skipped over these ads because I do not want to buy and have no intention of buying it in the future. I skipped over that add today and was about to write a check-in when I then get the message saying something along the lines of “Woah, we see you trying to write so we’ve decided to make something special for.” I believed that this was going to be a nice note or just something sweet for the users but it was actually an add for reflectly premium again, however this time, I couldn’t get around it. I am actually not able to use the app anymore unless I get reflectly premium! If this was you intentions the whole time, just make the app not be free. That way people know what they are getting into. I knew that I wasn’t going to get all of the best features but I didn’t know that after a certain amount of time, I would not be able to make entries. Reflectly has been my way of relieving stress and after everything that happened with the US government, I was looking forward to it. This was just a major slap in the face after I had been having a very good time on the app. Other than that, reflectly has been amazing.

I truly like the calmness/chill and time line based design of the app. But I can't even use it now. I ain't dropping any money on any app period and for those you were helping, me included, might possibly b feeling dropped off bc we can't do anything. Nothing. 
I know it's cheap but, I'm just disappointed. In my opinion You should have features like at least the ""mood, voice, and photo"" options in the ""+"" tab b free. 
This app really helped me express things when I couldn't talk to anyone it put things into writers bc of the way it walks through things- but sadly I'll b in the market for a new free app. That I can use. ❤️
