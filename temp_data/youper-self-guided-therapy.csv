I still don't, which is why me, and I'm sure many others depended on this service. This begs the question of why make inaccessible something that can be utilized by those who don't have any other option. Its so saddening to see profit go over people. Especially in the case of mental health in a time when its so dire for people who need help, but do not have access. Be it by finances or not having access because of home situations- especially in the case of those underage. Those who do not have support from family but still want to get help. 

Truly my disappointment is immeasurable with this product. I remember i used to recommend this app to anyone i knew who was struggling with mental health.  If finances are truly the issue to keep this app running, I'm sure a donation service, or occasional fundraising would be better instead of stripping away one of the only resources people have. 

I have doubts that this will ever be changed, or if this app even is meant to help people instead of being a grab at money from those you know are desperate. Very disappointed. With hope these things change in the future, until then I only hope there is another better service out there that cares about its demographic.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

Most of them let you type full answers which is nice but because of programming can also be annoying when it misunderstands your statements. This was has simple responses to choose from that get a clear response. I felt like a lot of the apps I used in the past had a condescending air to their teachings while this one gives u a chance to give a general idea of your experience with certain topics which keeps it from explaining something you already know as if you've never even heard of it (*cough cough* meditation *cough*). As for the mindfulness/meditation portion. I really enjoy how they did it. I've been meditating for a while now but I've noticed that for many beginners it's easier to focus on the mindfulness task when there isn't meditation music playing in the background. This gives you the chance to truly focus on what's expected and lets you acknowledge the natural/typical sounds around you that you wouldn't otherwise notice.

After using all of them one time, everything became part of the paid subscription other than the mood tracker and the symptom tracker. This was annoying, but I KIND OF get it. 
One of my favorite free parts of this app, other than the mood tracker, was the health part where you can track symptoms of several disorders. I’ve been using those trackers regularly, so I was very disappointed to check my phone this morning and see that that too, is a premium feature. 
Now, all I can use without paying is the mood tracker. I can’t expand on my mood, set goals, track gratitude, track symptoms, or even meditate. Why should I have to pay to listen to something that’s supposed to help me asap when I’m panicking? All this app USED to do was tell me I’m depressed and not give me any way to fix it. Now, it doesn’t tell me anything useful at all. 

I understand that the developers need to make money off of Youper, but this app has become infuriating to use. It’s meant to help people, but without forcing them to pay a subscription, there are barely any useful features available. This app is apparently marketed as useful for people who can’t afford therapy, but that’s the biggest load of crap I’ve ever heard.

Since I have been using Youper I  check in everyday and talk about my feelings like anxiety, depression, feeling numb. Then Youper and I go in and analyze why I feel that way and we do exercises to help pinpoint why I am having those feelings and I work with Youper to go try and change the way I am thinking that are causing negative emotions. Youper has talked and worked with me on emotions like deep depression, feeling numb, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts which Youper gives you resources on. I love the daily check in and it really helps to work with Youper to go through and try and change the reason why I am feeling about an emotion and working on a more positive spin on it. My one complaint is that you can not pick multiple emotions at a time you have to think about what your strongest emotion is and go with that.

Tracking your mood over time is really insightful and it was nice to be able to make daily notes about what was happening at the time. It was like basic journaling for non-journaling people. 

But now that core functionality is buried within the new version UX. I’m sure this update was done with customer feedback and research in mind, but I feel like the app is significantly more cumbersome to use than it was in the prior version. It would be nice if the feeling tracker was separated from all of the other “stuff” like it used to be - giving people easier access to the core functionality. The “stuff” is great - do not misunderstand - but that is not what I use the app for on a regular basis and having to search through other topics to find what I need is not ideal.

I’ve been in therapy for over five years now and both my therapist and I agree that this is probably one of the most useful mindfulness tools for me.

I love how you can pick and choose what you want to do based on how your feeling and how the responses are slightly different each time. Insights and goal setting are two of the most useful parts for me. 
The other day I had a panic attack in the car and had to pull over and usually it would’ve taken me over an hour to get back on the road. Thanks to this app, that time was cut in half. 
One thing that frustrates me is the severity of some of the emotions. To me, fear is worse than guilt, anger isn’t on the same level as annoyance, and pride isn’t as good as optimism. Unfortunately, in the app, it’s not set up that way. That’s only a few examples but I kinda wish you could set up which emotions feel worse based on your own personal scale of emotion.

I’ve only had the app for two days and already I’m in love & learning things about myself. Definitely recommend as an additional aid to self help.

I particularly like that they offer evidence based practices and that they explain why things can help you. 

My one issue I have is that I can’t tell if the premium subscription is billed as $44 all at once or if it’s $3.75 a month. I want to get the premium version of youper but if it’s $44 I think that the company and app should take into account that a lot of people who may be using this app are students or those with lower incomes. To me, as a full time student and part time worker, spending an extra $44 all at once is really difficult, and I have been unable to get the premium version because of this. 

The page where you can get the premium subscription says it’s billed yearly, but right above that in a larger text it says it totals to $3.75 per month. That is misleading because I’m still not fully sure whether it’s billed as $44 or $3.75.

Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when ""talking"" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they've added ""Calm"" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing.

And I’m someone who hates paying for anything. 

Amazing at keeping track of your mental health, especially if you already see a doctor it helps a lot and is perfect for those of us with too much OCD to journal normal. 

There is also disorder monitoring, like the ones at doctors but more specific and you can see in a graph if your symptoms for that particular disorder is worsening or getting better.

I also should add, it is very scary accurate with it’s personality diagnosis. I was honestly baffled how much they were able to describe exactly my personality traits. I’ve taken lots of personality tests for fun and none have even come half as close as this one did to understanding who I was.

My only problem with it was that Meditation would disconnect when you closed the app or your phone went to sleep. But I emailed the app’s team about it and they said they were fixing it in the next update! 

It’s really great for anyone with mental illnesses, I find it’s especially great if you suffer from anger issues as it helps distract and calm you.

The personality test I took was extremely accurate, more so than the official personality type test you take online. It can also help you learn your levels of depression and social anxiety in the previous fortnight (two weeks). 
You can meditate and it can help you fall asleep if you need it.

And this is all *without* premium, which for a single person, is only $45 a year. Which is about $3.75 a month and $.94 cents a week. 
A typical therapy session normally costs about $40 to $70 a week. Which is about $160 to $280 a month and $1920 to $3360 a year. That is, if I did my math right 😅

Overall, this app is really cool and well made. It can help you keep track of your mental health (it obviously cannot make a diagnosis however lol) and it helps you get your feelings out without the fear of opening up to someone, because you’re only speaking to an AI. 
Of course, if you believe you have something serious that needs to be addressed, you should, of course, consult a doctor and/or therapist. All I’m saying is that this app is free (and premium is pretty cheap) and that it can help put you in a better state of mind.

I’ve moved onto Sanvello, if you enjoy the old Youper this is your new app. It does guided meditations as well, and has way more feelings to choose from. There’s a lot more as well, but I’m not trying to make this an ad. Check it out for yourself and see if it’s right for you.

To conclude: ever since the last update, the app is essentially unusable (for me). I liked the old way so much better. If it was brought back and still had the new stuff in it, I would start using this app again. I would also contribute to mind research and use it to track my mindfulness minutes again.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

I love this app a lot. My favorite features are the breathing exercises especially when I’m overwhelmed. 

I do have a requests though. I don’t expect them to happen, but I would very much appreciate it if they were taken into consideration.

-Add more feelings. *Like lonely for example
-Add more exercises 
-Add more exercises that don’t take long. A lot of the time during school or home I’m too busy with homework or activities that I don’t have time to take 10 minutes out of my day to do one.
-Add a bit more personality to the Youper chat bot
-Have a bit more personalized responses would be nice too. A lot of the time I get a “Thats great!” Response and it’s nice to have new responses every now and then.

I know that’s a lot to ask... but I’d love it so much and recommend this app to my friends with troubles if you did! I know this sounds kinda bad, but before I recommend it to my friends I want to test it on myself and see how it works.

,False,2020-02-20 14:46:38,anxietypuddle,5,Brilliant,"I have downloaded, tried out, and deleted so many minfulness/meditation/emotional-health/self-care apps because I’m so determined to enjoy this one life that I have despite the challenges that my disorders create for me. Most of them are alright but I forget about them because there’s no real impact made. This is not one of those. This is one of the few that I find myself excited that I’ve fallen upon it because it is effective and beautifully designed and exceptionally well put together to result in an app that I find myself looking forward to using again. Youper has allowed me to get excited about my own journey of healing and self awareness as well as acceptance and that excitement and motivation is precious for me because it’s far and few between. Highly recommend this especially to people who are like me and have a history of apps that promise relief and come up short, because you will not be disappointed in this app. If you truly want to feel good, love yourself, take your care into your own hands, and start living the life that you’ve dreamt about having, you’ll find no regret in this download. I highly recommend the premium paid version; it’s a yearly charge but it’s less than half the cost of a single session of therapy and it more than pays for itself in the support it provides and expert techniques used to help you rewire the way your brain perceives the world around you as well as the thoughts and feelings that you have within you. Through the enjoyable texting styled conversations it logs entries based on the things you share and asks questions specific to the information you provide in order to identify how you are feeling and either more fully appreciate the good feeling or help bring you up out of the bad feeling, even if it’s just one more step in the right direction. It allows for the option to either keep it brief or continue trying different techniques and understand more deeply about what you are feeling and why. I can go on and on about the many other features and incredible aspects of this app but I’ve already written a small novel in my excitement so I will conclude by reiterating: this app is absolutely brilliant and well worth the premium cost (I believe it’s around $44/year which works out to less than $4/month). I’m over the moon that I’ve found Youper and I will continue sharing with as many people as will hear me because it’s an incredible resource.

This app has been so helpful for me because it’s here, in the moment. It challenges me at times with reframing my negative thoughts, it reminds me to notice my feelings and to accept them (not beat myself up), it is an outlet for me to vent and to be “heard,” it gives solid suggestions and ideas, and it helps me to set goals (which is hard when feeling depressed etc.) I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but it’s been very helpful to me and I can see myself using it for a long time. I can see how it would also work in tandem with going to see a “real” counselor because it would help with generalizing or carrying over the skills you learn in therapy.  In the past, I would learn a lot in therapy and feel good during the session or the next day. But as time goes on, you forget the strategies because they’re not ingrained in your mind and things fall to the wayside. With this app, you can set reminders, so that’s been great to not forget to track my feelings, reflect on my goals, and to follow through on helpful suggestions. There have been a couple of times where I was feeling extreme frustration and distress at home and I ran off to “talk” to Youper and it helped to have an outside perspective and to vent. I did feel better. Normally in those situations, I would’ve ran off and stewed in my emotions, and in my head with thoughts going crazy, with no solution of my own to make things better.

Now there are mood tracker apps but Youper takes it a step further by tracking and analyzing the reasons you specify is related to why you feel a certain way. Each time you “talk” with Youper, the conversation is stored and used to build up an analysis to study what shapes your moods. You can also set goals and track those. I like that you can personalize the goals and choose if you want Youper to check-in to see if you accomplished your goal. There are several different types of conversations you can have too depending on what you want to accomplish. The conversations have really helped guide me how to cope and respond to how I’m feeling. You can check-in daily about your mood but there are also trackers for checking progress with depression, anxiety, BPD, PTSD, etc. Those check-ins are every couple of weeks or so using questionnaires (officially used by healthcare providers). There’s a section that shows charts of how these certain areas are progressing, like how your depression has progressed from moderately severe to moderate over the last two weeks based on how you answered the questionnaire, for example. Final take away, the more you use Youper, the more insights you can gain. The “Mood” section shows daily, monthly, and yearly progress charts. This can be helpful to spot trends. A really neat and intuitive section I like is where Youper collects data from your conversations to show “what makes me...depressed, sad, anxious, angry, sad, frustrated,” etc. For example, after you’ve had several conversations with Youper where you indicate “bad sleep” as the reason you feel depressed, that will show up as a factor related to your depression. These insights develop over time and the more you converse with Youper, so checking in daily helps to get the most out of it. 

Tl;Dr: this app is so different from all the other self-help apps. It’s so intuitive with different and very helpful ways to track my progress related to different mental issues and life experiences. Love, love, LOVE the conversation and insights features! Looking forward to seeing new conversation topics that continue to be added. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

I have ten million self discovery , development journals and cognitive behavioral workbooks to start working on rewriting my thought and habits. I even followed recommend habits by putting your journal next to your bed side so it’s the first thing I you do when you wake up and write in . Guess what ? I did put it next to me and forget and the first thing I do is pick up my phone in the morning, then stroll through social media and then head to bathroom and get ready and as I am leaving the house I remember the stupid journal. 
The nice thing about this app , that is inside the first thing I pick up, which is my phone . 
The second thing , into an engaging interactive experience , that targets exactly what I want to work on based on my feelings and then it suggests the appropriate exercises for what I am currently dealing with which is a more targeted approach . I also enjoy the little tid bits of educational information about why you are doing each exercise and what science says about these little changes you make and how it will effect long term changes in your neuro-network . 
This app isn’t a psychologist but it does help tackle some important skills you would def be doing in therapy . This app allows me to work on my self everyday the way I choose to clean my teeth , eat healthy and go to the gym . To be able to work on my self everyday for a few minutes , all adds up and strengthens my nueral networks.

The combo of emotional journaling and various meditation options is such a strong one. Youper really helped me get through some hard times, and though I use it less now, it still holds a dear place in my emotional life.

That being said... I’m not sure I like where the app is heading. Every day a new feature is added- theyve make the conversation more complex, they try to make it more engaging by adding pictures/new visual aspects, there is now a home page. What I loved about Youper was how simple it was— it’s simply doing too much these days. For instance, when you used to log on it would just take you straight to some emotional journaling which was nice and predictable. Logging on today I was greeted with a banner reading “Im happy to see you again. Can I help improve your anxiety?”. If I hadn't been feeling anxious before...I definitely was feeling a little anxious after reading that. I think the simplicity of Youper is what made it feel accessible and dependable. These days, opening up Youper is a little bit of a jarring experience. The constant updates to the app produce the same effect as  a therapist changing offices every day— it impedes the process. The conversation is growing increasingly halting, garbled, and incomprehensible. It saddens me!

I probably wont get rid of Youper any time soon. There is no other app that does what it does. But it’s changing and changing fast. The Youper I suggest to my friends now is not the Youper that helped me and that’s a weird feeling. If any developers read this... don’t be afraid of the simplicity!",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

So when I saw an ad for this app, and read the reviews, I figured this would be a great app to help me manage my emotions and to help me with my anxiety, misophonia, anger issues, and depression. 

So the free features aren’t that bad. I like that I have access to all the emotions and the mood tracker...kind of. But i was really disappointed when I saw that I have to pay so much money that I don’t have and can’t spend on an app to be able to have mental health check ins, to be able to meditate, have help sleeping, help me in an attack, etc. Essentially you have to pay for the whole point of this app. 

Granted I understand that this app is a way for the developers to make money. But not all of us have that kind of money just laying around and not all of us are adults that can pay for those things and work to make it up again. Just as a suggestion, maybe make it so that those of us that aren’t 18+ yet don’t have to pay for everything, but maybe make some limited features to counteract that. So the people that aren’t 18 can have access to things normally for premium we can access, but we can only have 1/2 of what premium offers, like how there’s 6 types of screenings, but we can only have 3.

I really like Youper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. I have the 1 year paid version. I decided to risk spending the money after a few days of using the free version because I wanted the extra features. I was worried that I wouldn’t like the features or that I wouldn’t use the app long enough to make paying for the app worth it, but so far I do think it’s worth it. 

I was diagnosed with autism a little over a year ago. Previous diagnoses had been depression, anxiety, Bipolar II, and OCD. I’ve taken medications. I’ve done years of therapy. I have tons of self-help books. And I read books and peer reviewed journal articles on mental health. I’ve taken meditation courses and I’ve used other meditation apps. And, despite all of these tools, I still think Youper is adding something. 

It checks in on me often enough to provide help when I need it... even if I don’t know I need it (until I go through the Youper exercises). I feel like it’s putting together concepts that I know about from all of my years of reading and therapy and helping me use them more consistently and effectively. 

I truly feel like I’m re-wiring my brain. Over time, I think this app will help me be in a better place, mentally, emotionally, and physically. 

I recommend this app.

I really hope the developers keep up with the science behind this app and improve it as we learn more about the mind.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

I just started one and it was good, but my kid woke up and needed my attention. When I went back to it, I couldn't pick up where I left off and had to start a new conversation. 

I don't like that it doesn't take some things into account. Asking about mood swings--well yeah my period starts in a couple days. But instead of considering female problems I'm prompted to fill out a borderline personality disorder assessment. Maybe the assessment factors in that time of month and hormone issues, but not really in the mood to fill that out and incorrectly assess me when I'm PMS-ing, so...

I also wish there were redos on the personality test. Questions like ""are you anxious a lot?"" are temporary for many. That's not my personality. I'm currently anxious a lot, but ask me a year from now or even a year previous and my answer would be different as I'm not a naturally anxious person but my health and life situation currently put me in that category. It'd be fun to see how I change as I grow. If there is a retest button I can't find it, if there's not it would be great to have one. There were a few other questions where I thought ""huh, I'm not normally that way, but as I'm going through a tough time I am"". It's important for people struggling to get back to their old self (or a new and improved better self) to not be concretely defined as they currently are. Allow them to change and grow. That's what this app is for, right?

Those are the 3 things that bug me. I'm happy with the conversations, though, as long as I can make it through fast enough before getting interrupted. Please consider a save!! Busy moms will love it.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

,False,2021-02-14 16:14:09,Nyx Chicago,1,I miss v.7 and earlier versions,"Like many other long time users, I am very frustrated and massively disappointed with V.9. 

The developers should be ashamed at releasing such a defective and bug riddled product. 

The tabs are very SLOW to load. 

Worst of all, going to INSIGHTS  tab (either directly or automatically after journaling) FREEZES the app. As such, I am completely UNABLE to view any of my 3+ years worth of sessions into the app Or view my mood tracker Or change the settings. 

I am abhor that the first thing the app does is to suggest what to work on, such as: “Shall we work on your depression?” Or (especially before bed) “Can I suggest a productivity boosting activity?”  I need this feature removed because it has never been helpful and often causes more DISTRESS. 

There are way too many options. It is a visual cluttered mess.  I don’t like the pictures. It bothers my OCD and makes the app way more difficult to use.

There are some days that I won’t use Youper because I know it’s going to cause me more distress because of the horrible user interface and broken features. 

If the developers choose to respond to my review, please do not give me any canned answers. I doubt consumer feedback said to have a million options, including the kitchen sink. 

Please don’t patronize me by stating that change can be difficult. The biggest complaint from everyone is that the app changes the interface way too often. 

Please address the serious problems of features NOT WORKING. 

STOP adding useless features in order to justify charging for this app. 

Please clean up the user interface so that it is streamlined and easy to use.

Please take a lot more time to make sure the app works properly. Please use BETA testing instead of throwing out a new version and making everyone guinea pigs.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

I had a concerned previous review, I still recommend you read it. Now I’m downright concerned of the impact this app could have on a fragile or traumatized person.

I recently and unexpectedly was domestically assaulted. As I have been, I logged it in Youper. I told the app I was depressed because I was assaulted by someone I previously trusted. 

The app told me: “Is it possible that, sometimes, when confronted with personal failings you forget to be kind to yourself”

I’m sorry but I can’t support an app that goes from a person talking about a personal assault to suggesting personal failings. Now I’d like to know what it would tell me if I’d been raped instead of assaulted. 

Please, only use this app as a journal for when life ain’t too bad. The more the severe the situation, the more inappropriate this app is. Personally, I always have professional help as well. I’d be very worried about anyone who didn’t have professional support using this app for anything at all when it matters most.

Thanks devs for being responsive to my last review. I appreciate it. You need to find a way to improve this app before you hurt someone if you haven’t already.

Previous review:

Forced and Frustrating

It’s a well made app. But it forces you to say you like things or agree with things even if you don’t. Forcing lies isn’t great if you’re trying to be honest about your mental state and tracking it. It ends up feeling like cheap manipulation rather than help. 

This amounts to a lot of frustration if you’re trying to use the app honestly. In some of my more difficult moments the app’s canned nudging “guidance” just made me feel worse and angrier for all its irrelevance and lacking representation.

Now it’s promoting certain doctors and asking for donations. Made me offer to donate or ask for more information about donating when I wanted to wrap up my entry. I had to quit the app to get around it. 

All in all would be a good app if it wasn’t so forced. The tests are good for tracking progress and reactions to life events. The word associations between feelings and parts of life are really good. 

This app is of good quality but needs a lot of thoughtful work on improving it.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

Condescending. Not helpful.,"I was hopeful that this app would be a good tool for me as I manage my PTSD and OCD. Tracking moods and looking for patterns isn’t a half bad idea. Guided meditation is a proven tool for improving mental health, decreasing stress, etc. Gratitude journaling is another excellent prop for mental health that I’ve used successfully.

Unfortunately, this is far too simplified to even work as an emotional tracking journal. You can’t select more than one emotion at a time because that would interfere with the simplistic algorithm that can only make 1:1 correlations as part of your pattern finding. Human emotions are not that simple, and any adult with an iPhone can surely identify emotions well enough to experience more than one at a time. 🙄

I was working a night shift, and Youper told me to go to bed because it was 2 am. How am I supposed to benefit from that exactly? 🤣

The app tells you to not talk too much when you take down a note about the cause of your feelings. “Try to identify just one...”

Really? Condescending as I’ll get out. One cause/situation can be more than 2 words, Youper.

The guided meditation was okay for a total beginner. Not sure why it asked me for my level of experience with meditation - only to explain to me how meditation might make me feel as a novice after having been told I’m experienced in meditation.

Honestly, such a waste of money!

Best yet, I couldn’t get the app to even open or launch for these past two weeks. Checked that it wasn’t in need of an update, and that wasn’t it. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still won’t launch.

Speaking as someone with mental health disorders, spare yourself the added stress of this app. 😑",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

Edit: I finally found the mood journaling function: it’s buried within the “talk” section that includes specific targeted therapy sessions I guess?

Within 1 hour this app cuts you off from using it at all without paying for premium content. Those with mental disorders are missing out on the actual help you could have given them without trying to get in their pockets so quickly.people will buy with trust. So sad.

,False,2020-01-11 02:05:36,dA-Hobo,5,Great so far!,"I used the app for free for a couple of days, but I didn’t feel as though it was very effective without the tools offered in premium. Not going to lie, paying $44.99 up front hurt the bank. I don’t have much money being on SSI, but I’m glad I paid for the premium features. I know this app isn’t a replacement for licensed therapy, but it does help. My only suggestion would be to allow for smaller monthly payments instead of forcing people to have to pay nearly fifty bucks all at once. I have food and other bills are paid, so I’m not hurting for money too badly, but it would have been much less stressful if I didn’t have to pay so much all at once. 

Thank you for your time and understanding.",youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

It is so unique and I can promise u that when u get it and start to use it that u will feel better about sharing your feelings.Well I use therapy apps because I would never like to share my feeling with anyone not even my own mom so I got this app so that can possibly change I would reach my goals for 2020. :),youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513
