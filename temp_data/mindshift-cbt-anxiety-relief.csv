Great tools and info!,False,"As a young adult I‚Äôve always had some small level of anxiety that I‚Äôve dealt with. The pandemic and job stress has just amplified all of that. I don‚Äôt think my anxiety is so severe that I need to get a therapist (mostly because of the cost) so I wanted to find ways to manage my anxiety. This app is exactly that! It‚Äôs extremely educational and user friendly to the point where I can feel my anxiety diminish as I‚Äôm using it. Just reading through the descriptions of ‚Äúperfectionism‚Äù made me feel so much better because I‚Äôve always been a perfectionist and I had never realized how that affected so many aspects of my life. I‚Äôm not free from anxiety, but I‚Äôm slowly learning how to manage it thanks to the great info and tools provided by this app.",anxious alyssa,5,2021-05-04 06:06:31,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
The ball was a bit of the glitch and I didn‚Äôt get to it again until the last update,False,I don‚Äôt want to see you but I don‚Äôt want to see you again I don‚Äôt want to see you again I don‚Äôt want to see you again I don‚Äôt want to lose it all you again I don‚Äôt want to see you again I don‚Äôt know what I want you to say that you don‚Äôt have anything to say bye to you bye y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have a lot to say I don‚Äôt know what you want me I want you don‚Äôt know I love that you‚Äôre not gonna like me anymore I‚Äôm sorry I just want you to know I don‚Äôt want to see you again I don‚Äôt want to lose you but you don‚Äôt have anything to or do you or me I know you have no idea how about that I love that I can help me with this and you don‚Äôt want me bye,AK|TwistiTwik,5,2021-04-20 19:43:42,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
"Overall great, age range issue",False,"This app is really well thought out. It is a great avenue for people that struggle with anxiety or worry a lot. My issue is with the recommended age range for this app. To get the most out of this app you need to be able to give pretty well though out out answers as well as have a good reading ability. I think it‚Äôs is best for adolescents or working adults. Tracking your progress is a large part of this app and at four years old it‚Äôs not going to happen. A lot of people who struggle with anxiety etc are too afraid to get help from a person, so this app is perfect for them.",KevinO Loyola,4,2021-02-02 16:20:12,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
I feel better already!,False,"I just got this app and I can already tell how much this app can do for me! I have to daily report which I love because it allows me to review how I FEEL. The breathing techniques are so good and helped me fall asleep. My social anxiety has not helped me make many friends this year, and because of that I dread going to school, being the ‚Äúquiet kid‚Äù I‚Äôm not usually quiet, I‚Äôm just not with my friends. I‚Äôm going to follow the apps tips to help conquer my social anxiety and make some friends!",gennygigi,5,2021-01-13 09:57:43,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
Amazing App,False,"The MindShift app has been phenomenal for me. This past year has been incredibly stressful, and it‚Äôs easy to get caught in a loop of anxious thinking and avoidance actions when you‚Äôre alone 24/7. This app has cleverly directed my thoughts in the right direction.  I‚Äôd say the secret is the CBT basis, which changes your thinking over time.  The most helpful thing is the belief experiments.  Seriously.  This app is the best.",Trixies t,5,2021-04-02 15:19:33,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
Only 3 Entries per Day?,False,"I really like what this app has to offer, especially the cue cards, but the limit to 3 check-ins a day is going to ruin it for me. I definitely feel anxious way more than 3 times a day, not being able to document that and see changes over time is really disappointing. I will try to use it more but I really need more than 3 entries",essiecab,4,2021-01-08 19:08:48,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
Male and female voices,False,"As a therapist I have referred many of my clients to this app. It really is very helpful. I love how there are a MALE AND FEMALE voices for each audio clip. I work with a lot of trauma survivors and they are often triggered by most frequently a Male voice since their abusers were male.

But I go today to find the labels MALE AND FEMALE have been replaced by AUDIO 1 and AUDIO 2. My only guess is for political correctness and how dare someone actually call a Male voice male and a female voice female. But instead you risk triggering the truly traumatized.",Psycheku,3,2021-01-06 03:48:08,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
For anxiety,False,This is probably one of the best health apps I have ever seen for anxiety. I have been looking for an app like this as I have really bad anxiety and am not able to get help from a therapist. This helps me tremendously. I recommend this app to anyone who needs help but can‚Äôt afford it,Haileybeecx,5,2021-01-24 16:09:34,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
üòÑüëç,False,"This app is amazing, it has many great features. It has different things for you to read so you can learn about stress, anxiety, panic, etc. There are also different resources in case you have anxiety, stress, panic, etc. I HIGHLY suggest this app to anybody who has stress, panic, anxiety, etc.",Wolflover6265,5,2021-05-02 17:21:51,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
Wonderful just wonderful,False,I don‚Äôt really have much to say on this because I just have no words.

MindShift review,False,"I would rate this app before four of five although it has appropriate emotional language that younger youth may understand I think older adolescents may not identified with those presented and may want to elaborate their feelings. It provides themes that are age-appropriate to adolescence, however they lack visuals that would help and benefit younger children in keeping them more engaged.",fabym8,3,2021-02-02 23:43:00,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
This is an amazing app,False,"This is the best app ever. 1. It‚Äôs COMPLETELY FREE 2. It has different ways to cope with anxiety 3. U can add goals, write a check in, and set up ways to look at anxiety differently 4. Explains that anxiety is normal and explains where it comes from etc. overall u def need to get this app. I LOVE IT",A2J4,5,2021-01-25 06:54:47,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
Thank you,False,I am young and experiencing extreme social anxiety and anxiety and depression this app has been a blessing my family and friends tell me to use my app in dire days you are all mircals and I can‚Äôt say thank you enough and all of it being free is a blessing,allybaüòâ,5,2021-03-24 03:27:30,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
Worthless,False,This thing has crashed every time I have hit ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù of any type. When I registered. When i tried to ‚Äúcheck in.‚Äù It did not record anything that I had entered when it crashed for the check in. I suppose that it is a good flooding experience for people trying to reduce anxiety due to being frustrated with too much and too many things going wrong. I‚Äôm just glad I didn‚Äôt have to pay for anything.,Pshrynk1,1,2021-05-19 15:00:30,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825

Anxiety,False,"Great app!!! Just started using it, put it helped calm my anxiety that I have been feeling all day. Definitely recommended, although I wish it had a journal where I could just right down my thoughts.",Alexis Rachau,5,2021-01-11 21:48:21,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825

Can‚Äôt store more than 3 check-ins per day,False,How are you supposed to monitor your mood/anxiety if you can only track 3 per day?? It should be unlimited.,Bad Therapy App,2,2021-03-19 01:04:37,mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825
