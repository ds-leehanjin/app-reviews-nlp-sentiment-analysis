False,"I was pinged to renew my annual subscription and decided against it. I’ve had Pzizz for almost 12-months. The stories are interesting and I enjoy the majority I have heard. However the “music” selection one can choose to pair with the story is often macabre sounding to me. Not all of it, but I find it to be monotone, synthetic random sounds. Hard for me to explain but If there were soft instrumental music and / or a selection of nature noises w/ music to add to keep playing after the story, I would have renewed. There are other sleep apps which offer this, and are actually less expensive. They also offer endless stories…I hope you consider this in the future for those who prefer different “music”.",3,2021-06-26 04:25:05,GaryinOrinda,Not for Me,pzizz-sleep-nap-focus,915664862,
