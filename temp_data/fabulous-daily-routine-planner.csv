Elijah.Luis,False,5,Game Changer,"I am a 24 year old nurse with mental health issues and I have a couple of bad habits I’ve been trying to eradicate for months. I’ve tried dozens of apps from habit streaks to accountability apps to online counseling. I installed this app with the intent to explore it and nothing else. But this app is so cleverly designed, it is hard not to love. There are attractive features in this app that will help you build positive habits. Yet, I believe the real hook is the story about you that develops, which happens when you successfully complete your goals. This app does an excellent job of not just making you think, but making you do, which is what I think is the epitome of mental health. It doesn’t just strive to improve your mental health, it strives to improve your overall function. The app engages you in multiple ways, which sets it apart from the traditional templates of regular one-on-one convos with people who only roundabout with Pinterest-like “inspirational sayings.” I’m genuinely more motivated, more functional, and have made more changes in my life the past two weeks since I’ve downloaded this app than I have in the last three years. Fabulous mysteriously makes it fun to remind you to be yourself and be healthy and happy at the same time, and keeping those streaks up can be pretty satisfying too. However you use this app, whether it’s for a day or for a year - strive to commit to it, and you will reach your happiness.",2021-03-26 05:17:55,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Mommakelz17,False,5,This app is worth it,"I had previously come across this app in the past, downloaded it to see what the hype was and instantly deleted. Recently I came across this user who had recommended using fabulous to get back on track, and creating good, healthy habits. I’ve always been a routined person, but would fall off and struggle to keep track or stay on track. I would beat myself up and feel disappointed that I had to start over. After taking some needed time off for myself (especially during the pandemic) I am and have been working on myself to heal by getting back into creating healthy and happy routine for a better life. 

Just recently downloading this app (again) I wanted to put this to the test. Only after about a week of using this app, I will say that this app is by far one of the best apps I’ve ever used. It’s so gentle but so rewarding and honest about life and being “O.K.” With falling off track, making mistakes, counting the small wins, feeing appreciative, but the biggest one is making me believe in myself more by becoming the best version of myself. Mental health is so important and this app makes you feel like the darks do happen, but you can always come out on top. 

So if I had to say what is an app that works and I’m willing to spend the money...well, you’ve come to the right place.",2021-04-13 17:03:02,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
MrsPrado,False,5,Skeptically positive,I actually got this app a couple months ago when I needed so positive affirmations or medications to just kind of get through the day... as I started slinking a little further into a pretty dark depression I didn’t use it I actually deleted it for a bit and frustrated that I couldn’t get into to app. I thought this little story’s were annoying... then a few weeks back I had gotten so bad I wasn’t eating or taking care of my self at all I started searching for routine apps to just try and get myself taking care of myself to feel better... As I was searching I saw this app pop up and I remembered it did have routines as well. I re downloaded it and I can actually say for the last few weeks of using it. I’m starting to like the story’s and the guidance because I WAS READY... had I reviewed this app a couple months ago it wouldn’t have been positive because that’s not where I was... but I can now say thank you! Because this app is really helping me build better habits and stay on task and I check back on it often and now listen to the story’s because I know it’s going to get me to that next level of taking care of myself. As a Mom/Wife/ and in Management... Who has time for that? Right. Thanks again for a program that’s actually working for me.,2021-04-12 01:02:45,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Only Lee Bay,False,2,Glitching out,"If this app was working right, it would be a five star app. But it is not and has not been for about two weeks. It’s been glitching, not allowing me to access today’s list of goals and routines to check off. My daily coaching option that’s on my routines no longer brings anything up to play for the day and instead just has a list of activities you could bring up. I bought the lifetime subscription and I’m kicking myself for it now that nothing is working on it. I’ve been using this app on and off for five years among varying devices without glitching issues and now all the sudden now that I’m on day 34 or so on my current journey, it’s just decided it no longer needs to work. 
Another annoying thing is that if you forget to mark the things off as you’re doing them and decide to mark it off later, it doesn’t seem to count it the same as though you didn’t actually do anything but are just checking it off. I find this incredibly annoying. Not everyone has time to stare at their phone after every activity on their list and check it off. I’m a busy person. Some of us want to check it off later, that doesn’t mean we didn’t do it when we are supposed to. Good lord.
Also, I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall this app several times just to get it to work. I shouldn’t have to do that. There’s plenty of space on my phone and everything else works fine. Why is this app so glitchy?!",2021-03-10 17:40:42,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
jeff_ames,False,1,***RIPOFF***SCAM***THIEVES,"Tried this app last year and didn’t find it all that motivating. No worries…everyone has their preferences. Forgot to cancel before my free 30 day trial was up. No worries…that’s on me. But I made sure to go in and cancel right away so I wouldn’t make the same mistake again. Imagine my surprise when I started getting ‘payment failed’ emails after the one year anniversary of the expiration of my free trial. Like, enough emails to be considered harassment. So finally, I responded to one of them and reminded them that they did not have an active credit card on file because I was no longer an active account holder. I received an automatic response saying how much they value me as a customer and they’ll try to get back to me as soon as they can, but they’re super busy. No worries - they can never get back to me as far as I’m concerned - the whole point of my email was that I was trying to get them to STOP contacting me. SOOO…imagine my surprise when I checked my credit card statement today and found that a week after my email that they were too busy to respond to, they MIRACULOUSLY found my credit card information and charged my account for another year!!! NOT fabulous. SNEAKY and UNETHICAL!! Oh, and if you’re wondering if they ever responded to my email…they did not. Too busy looking for my unauthorized credit card information, I imagine.

justletmereviewomg,False,1,"Beautiful UI, bad UX","So the path of slow and steady incremental changes makes a ton of sense. The kinds of tasks it seems like the app orients on, also seem well founded and useful. However, the way you interact with the app itself to achieve those ends is so confusing and unintuitive to me. There’s no one place to look at what I’ve achieved or how I’m doing, or which goals I might choose. Even after using it for a few days, I’m still unsure of where to find any succinct information or even which buttons I should be pressing. In addition, the way it offers me the option to make goals and follow up with those goals just doesn’t match the natural way I make decisions or the flow of my day. 
For example, I’d see the notification to drink water with bleary eyes immediately after waking up, but before my brain can comprehend. Then it disappears into the fog of slowly waking. This morning, I finally did get myself to immediately open the app and log that I drank water, then it promptly opened a loud animated cut scene which was pretty annoying for me, but even more annoying for the person asleep next to me. I hastily closed the whole thing. 
I’d really like to utilize the set of slow and consistent reminders that seem to be at the heart of this app, but what does it matter if I can’t actually figure out how to use it? Frankly, every time I open this app I eventually just angrily close it, and am left feeling frustrated. I’d never pay for it.",2021-01-02 21:48:28,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,"{'id': 20472351, 'body': ""We appreciate your feedback and we're sorry to hear about the confusing interface.

Msantg,False,5,Brought me back to myself.. and then some,"After going through a very dark period, and as someone who has struggled with depression my entire life, I can honestly say Fabulous helped bring me back to life, back to myself. I have spent decades learning self care and reparenting myself, but in the very dark times, it can still be challenging to come out the other end. In this particular instance, I truly needed my hand held and guidance back to my light. Fabulous gave me this gift and so much more. When in a state of depression, something as simple as remembering to drink water or eat a good breakfast or move my body can feel like a mountain to climb. Fabulous’ gentle daily reminders, along with lovely inspiring encouragement, made all of these small goals attainable again. If you’ve struggled with depression, you know the impact such small feats can have. I have been using the app for over a month now and after completing the first journey am feeling so much more energized and vibrant - I feel like my true self again. It has truly laid the foundation for me to continue living my life healthily and happily. In a word, Fabulous has become my greatest companion or ally. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",2021-01-29 14:55:51,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Netta Lynne,False,4,Overall a great app,"I have recommended this app to multiple people as it has been a great way for me to track my progress and receive consistent accountability. I love how customizable the routines are, and while there is guidance from the app, you’re ultimately in control of your experience. As far as feedback goes, I’ve grown to strongly dislike the background music. I understand the healing and relaxation properties that music can have, but I find these specific tunes very annoying compared to meditative sounds I prefer. I have muted the sounds during the routines and also went to settings to turn them off. Unfortunately it comes back on no matter what I do. I also believe that celebrating overall progress would be nice. In addition to longest streaks, acknowledging consistent attempts will encourage people even more I believe. For instance, I have never completed an entire week of my routines, but there was one week I tried everyday, and there were only two days I couldn’t fully complete. I like to celebrate small wins, and that to me was one. Other than that I love what the Fabulous team is doing with the app. All I ask is that you either offer different selections of background music and/or allow a muting option that actually works please.",2021-04-28 16:38:18,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Jreeeezy,False,5,Great app to create and inspire new healthy habits!,"I stumbled across this app and thought I’d give it a shot. One of the things I suffer from is lack of accountability, I’ll procrastinate and avoid things of I can, choosing to lay around and be lazy if no one is telling me otherwise. This app reminds me throughout the day to practice new healthy habits that I chose to create a happier and more active me! The support from the positive community here and the inspiring little messages that come with goal completion give you that extra push to continue on the path you set up. I’ve only been doing it for a week and albeit a slow start, I am beginning to really see some new habits form and I love it! Be the healthier, happier you that you know you can and want to be. It’s as simple as saying “I want to change” and you don’t have to do it alone. Having served 10 years in the military I recognize the importance of support in trying to develop yourself into your goals. Except instead of a DI yelling in your face to push through, you have a supportive community that provides the same support, but in a calm and motivating manner. Different tactics, similar results!

loudrockz,False,3,Good but frustrating,"I have a lot of personal goals that just seemed impossible, this app was great for me a person with add who rd DS to push up hill than and force things rather than stop and do the things that lead to self care and happiness. For me it’s recipe to self love. Make sure you read at least one page, meditate for a few minutes. I like the animations and the calming music that helps me to slow down and be in the moment. But sometimes I fall off the wagon and though the intentions are good, im forced to fill out a form that takes too long and ultimately discourages me from getting back into my routine. Sometimes the Home Screen is so cluttered with junk I’ll never read. I
Or I ignore. Perhaps the ui hasn’t quite been mastered to make me care of the flow needs adjusted? I need a way out sometimes.  I also suggested to my partner to give it a shot, I really sold it to him because he’s doing self care work. The initial onboarding sent him into an eye roll and I’m certain he will never open it again. Which is sad because I feel like he could e joy it. I’m a designer and I get wanting to be the be all comprehensive app. But it feels like it’s gotten a little unwieldy.

MRStone27,False,4,"Good concept, confusing UI","This app totally works — building habits a little at a time is precisely what my last therapist told me works very well for my ADD and anxiety. Doing one thing for a few days, then adding another little thing, and so on, had been working great for me for a little over a week now. 
I’ve seen people say that the app is inflexible in its goals, but most of the time you can work around the specifics and do something else in the same vein. I can’t drink a full glass of water first in the morning because of my acid reflux, but I can remember that it’s a goal of mine and drink 4-5 extra sips. I don’t exercise first thing in the morning, but instead I did 8 mins of yoga. 
This is great therapy for those of us who can’t get access to behavioral therapy right now. I feel more refreshed when I go about my business in the morning because I have more habits to keep me moving. I feel rewarded just for drinking water. In principle, this app is amazing. 
The only issue is that there are so many buttons and screens that it gets wildly confusing sometimes as to what I’m trying to do and how I got here. I end up just force closing sometimes and starting over.",2021-04-12 13:18:06,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Kayoala101,False,5,Amazing app (highly recommend),"This app is absolutely amazing. It may have a confusing set up at first but it really helps you once you’ve figured out how it works. There’s routines for throughout the day which help you get up and start moving and have a plan for your day. This app also has “circles” designated to certain things that you may be struggling with. It allows you to chat with others from all around the world and share your experiences and help each other. I think this feature is really great because you get to see others progress in their life and you also get to help them with it, and share your progress. There are also journeys that you set up to help you with everyday problems. For example, social media detox, self-love, de-clutter, gratitude, being able to let go, journaling, etc. This app gives you a chance to reflect and change yourself for the better. It’s really inspiring all the positivity this app and the people using it radiates.

Mr. MearKat,False,3,App is nice,"I really like the visuals like seeing the calendar at a month glance and seeing the progress that I’ve made.

So I have been on track my calendar doesn’t show it and that makes me sad and I also know that I need to cancel my membership for this application going forward it’s two limiting and it’s not helpful when I feel defeated.

I enjoy the app I love the instant positive feedback. I appreciate the pace and reading about why were setting up the structure for personal success. However I am bummed that you can’t go back and rewatch the animated journey and there doesn’t seem to be away two go back and edit your meals or habits from the night previous. When I turn my phone off for the night I’m not gonna pick it back up to click that I did a meditation so I would like to be able to toggle between days and to rewatch cartoon journey , One for encouragement and two I was excited to share with others what a great app but there was not a way for me to do so.",2021-02-06 17:22:22,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
hilbarx,False,2,Not intuitive,"I tried to set up this app for the free trial (7 days) but it made me start with only one habit that happened to already be something I do every day. And then because I don’t always look at my phone every morning and didn’t check off a day even when I did it, it set me back to day 1. So the one week trial was useless to see if I could build new habits. When I cancelled before getting charged, they sent me an email offering me a 30 day trial since 7 days might not be enough—this seemed like a great option until I tried to use it and because I already had an account it said “you’ve already subscribed”. So they sent me a useless 30 day trial unless I want to create a second account and start over from day 1, again. 

Besides those issues, i found the animations to be rather annoying and pointless. Maybe it works better over the long term, but it really feels oriented towards teens and young adults and I wouldn’t recommend it. The interface is also not intuitive and you have to go through like 5 steps to check off each habit, which feels like it wastes a bunch of my time when I could be actually getting on with my day.

I am a millennial so I’m fairly competent with technology but I was truly just lost in this app so I quit using it and forgot about it. It was renewed without any reminders of notifications for the annual fee. I immediately cancelled it and attempted to contact customer service through the app to request a refund. I was shortly notified via email that I had to request a refund through a link they sent me. There were many options and I picked the one that said I forgot to cancel my free trial and I was notified that because Apple tells me when the free trial will end and the subscription will renew when signing up for the free trial, they do not refund for that. It was truly an honest mistake. Anyways, just to check, I attempted to see if a refund was able to be received for any of the reasons listed and they do not reimburse for their subscriptions no matter the case.

I deleted the app before the free trial had ended but my email is linked. I didn’t create a premium account though which I am really confused about.

Jessie Garner,False,5,This app has helped me more in two weeks than 3 years of medication ever has!,"I can’t say enough about Fabulous Premium. As someone diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, the app has been more helpful to me than anything I have tried so far, and it’s worth every penny! Fabulous helps by reminding you to take care of yourself before anything else. I’m learning that my mental and physical well-being is the foundation for success. There is never a shortage of support while progressing through routines and challenges. The challenges are simple—typically things you do every day—but the encouragement you get for completing tasks makes it seem like drinking water or brushing your teeth is a big deal. And it is!

I purchased the premium subscription, but would actually not recommend until some bugs were resolved and user experience issues. The timer for your schedule experiences does not continue outside of the app making it pretty useless in certain settings. But my REAL pet peave is how little journeys are customized and how specific they are about asking you to do things without knowing your diet/sleep schedule etc. For example, I intermittent fast, so when it tells me that for a journey I HAVE to eat breakfast three days in a row, can’t do that. A journey to “eat fish and seafood or flax seeds three times in a week” allergic to fish, can’t do that”, tells me to go to sleep and follow their schedule umm I work nights. there should 100% be an option to skip these journeys or convert them/ customize them/ change the time they’re to be accomplished, or something I don’t know but the user experience I do have in this area occasionally frustrates me.",2021-03-30 13:45:34,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

I do appreciate the task onboarding flow for night routines since I’m getting ready for bed and naturally have more time to spend on the app. 

This app should also come w/ a trigger warning as it stands today. The community posts aren’t filtered and the suicide notes were jarring for my first time looking through the community. Not saying we should sweep them under the rug, but these posts naturally get a lot of traffic because basic human instinct is to offer help to someone at their lowest point. However, I’m guessing the traffic pushed notes like this to the top of the feed. This resulted in me reading through at least 3-5 posts about suicide on day 1 using this app. Hoping there’s a compromise that can take place to remedy this issue.",2021-05-26 01:47:40,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
cataliep,False,5,Love this app,"I’ve been using Fabulous for a little over a week and I love it. The daily coaching can be very insightful and so far I’ve been able to cement the following morning habits: drinking water as soon as I wake up, eating a good breakfast to fuel up for the day, and doing some low-impact exercise in the mornings to help me wake up fully and get moving. This may not sound like a lot but just two weeks ago I was setting four alarms every night and snoozing them repeatedly in the morning, rolling out of bed and into the shower and trudging to work without having ingested anything but coffee. I particularly love that Fabulous discourages you from trying to take on too much at once or make too many changes; instead, the focus is on building one habit at a time and celebrating small victories. This makes it SO MUCH easier to actually stick with your new habits, without feeling overwhelmed.

The ambience within the app—the soothing & uplifting colors & music, even the voice of the “coach” in the mini-coaching sessions (2-3 mins)—is especially appealing to me, as I am a very visual person/learner. There are a few other features within the app that I’ve not yet fully explored; but overall, this app has helped me more in one week than any other accountability & encouragement avenues I’ve tried so far.

I’m never sure if I indeed checked off drinking water for that particular day or if i should add a afternoon habit & when. Sometimes, a video pops up when i accomplish a goal, sometimes it doesn’t. I’m unable to save the post to share tips on my phone.

Plus it’s got these cute stories, poems that are sort of like super quick mediation, and REALLY good animation. Plus it’s got a huge number of tips, gentle reminders, and inspirational messages to go along with the habits. So when it started telling me to eat breakfast every day (which you are technically allowed to delete if you’re super against breakfast I guess), it also started adding a daily tiny article about food, or breakfast ideas, or (my favorite) reminders to actually buy breakfast foods...

But it IS very good at tracking habits and offering motivation as well as sound principles and reasons for each step. I’m a fan! 

 I’ve at least been drinking water and usually eating breakfast as well as calming my self before bed—the three default habits the app starts you with. Aaaand I attached some other habits to the ones mentioned without actually logging them, just as part of completing the other steps like making my bed as I drink water in the morning and doing my skin care routine as part of my nightly coaching and wind down.

In fact, this app is my primary driver throughout the day. My days now have a beginning, middle, end. I am engaged in ways that make guide me to being present, inspired, and motivated to keep going. After first, we started small - 3 days in a row of drinking water. Then I added afternoon and evening routines. The app sends a morning, afternoon, and evening coaching clip - SUPER GOOD.

I feel like with other planning apps it leaves it all up to the user as to what you need to do and when and all those choices can seem overwhelming. I really appreciate the gentle introduction and slow adding of new habits which I’ve found has made them more lasting.

The second thing I’d like to see, being able to get back to videos or recordings that were available on previous days.

As someone who works at 4am in an actual shop, it’s really starting to worry me that I might not be able to keep up with the morning routine because I don’t want to wake up any earlier than I have to.

Gratification has always been an issue of mine. I love it for that. 

The only things that I would amend would be something like a “vacation mode” because when I am away or I have company I’m not always able to achieve each of my daily goals. This makes me feel like I haven’t done enough with my day. The inability to do that task sets me back. 

For instance: when it is pouring outside and my goal is to take a short walk with my dog, I am unable to do so and it sets me back for the day. My boyfriend stays over and feels that he needs television to sleep so I stay up later than I want to to “unplug and darken the room.”

You can only do one journey or goal at a time - which is totally fine - but it doesn’t really *show* you what it wants you to do at any given point in the journey. The app is also super intrusive — if you go to check off an item or complete a task, it’ll suddenly blast out sound with some cheesy letter (the voice acting/graphics are atrocious and make the whole thing feel cheap). At first, I was constantly silencing my phone or quickly closing out the app whenever I checked something off. It’s definitely not something you can effectively use without headphones in non-private spaces. 

But again, it’s just sooo confusing. You can see everything you can’t actually do yet (or shouldn’t - as it recommends), which clutters up the entire home screen and makes the things you’re actually using less accessible.

This is a self care app, it promotes a healthy well-being and one of the ways is through reducing stress. This charge is causing me so and it seems their support team doesn’t care and have no intentions to help. It seems very hypocritical given the purpose of the app they run.

My experience w/ the app itself wasn’t even satisfying enough for me to consider keeping the subscription so I’m basically out of money and stuck w/ a service I don’t want and again, they do not care.

I’ve asked apple for a refund bc there is no way to contact the actual app about one, or any way for me to contact them about switching to the monthly fee instead of the annual amount. I’m really disappointed that this wasn’t made VERY clear at the beginning of this is what they intended to do. I’ll update my review as soon as apple gets back to me if this is easily resolved. It’s frustrating though because even apple doesn’t have a way for you to actually explain the situation. So now even if I do want to continue to use the app for the monthly fee I can’t because there is no real way to communicate!!

Th3sky15falling,False,5,Excellent Guide,"There is definitely science behind this app. I’m still less than one week in, but something about it is working. I was in a productivity rut. And I appear to be making progress again. Time will tell but the combination of meditation (positivity) with  incorporating new self care routines is a lovely way to hold me accountable. It’s like I crave that glass of water in the morning. I’ve known for a long time that I needed more water, and I’d go thru spurts and stops. It’s not just that I know I should anymore. This ‘craving’ is different. I don’t think I will want to not drink water in the morning again. The app is a little hokey in places but I like that, it helps me trust its intent. Even if it ends up not sustainable for me, it feels good trying it.  The ME who showed up at work today was fabulous!!",2021-04-23 03:38:32,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

I turned on notifications but it didn’t send me very many and the ones it did send didn’t have anything to do with my goals that I was working on. So just like with everything else, I forgot about it. Made it the three days with the water goal before I gave up on the app. I was already starting to drink water before I downloaded the app, and the app didn’t help at all. I was drinking water because I already was doing it, and then I’d forget to put it into the app. Also you can’t choose which goals to do, it does it for you. Honestly, I would have much rather done something other than drinking water, because I was already doing it, but it made me do water. Also for someone with ADHD the immersive moment things are just annoying, not helpful.

By helping me isolate small new habits I’ve been able to celebrate small accomplishments and changes that have effected my life in big ways. To stay, my mental health and second, my physical. This app is the must have for those who don’t put themselves first and need to reconnect with who they are and maybe even readjust. I have a few friends on it now too and we do challenges together!

The nagging to upgrade fades after a couple days and I’m sure that the nagging to rate will end very soon now that I am writing this. If you can get past the annoyances of being bothered to rate and buy for a few days then the app is totally worth it. I understand that they need to recoup the cost of building this beautiful, well thought out app. No free app Worth it’s salt doesn’t pressure you to buy something at some point unless it has a lot of donor backing from some foundation.

Then what? Have a good breakfast for 3 days in a row! Wow. So I am blowing my free week with two mindlessly simple challenges and the rest is all on me to take part in the community? I guess? It’s not actually clear to me. The whole idea is to make this self-betterment stuff easier but the first two challenges that take up the bulk of the free week are two of the easiest things to do. If this is what the first week is like I can imagine how underwhelming the second week will be. This app totally had me going for the first day! That “future me” stuff was great! Then on the second day I was like “well, you’re awfully quiet.” Days 3 and 4 were even more quiet. I guess my future self lost interest?

I think it could benefit from being simplified a bit. Now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks, I get how it works better. There are still times when I’m not sure how to get back to something or whether or not I actually checked off a goal or accomplished my steps for the day. The things I really like are the morning and evening reflections and the reminders that help keep me accountable. I like “the journey” though, I admit, I haven’t been progressing and I’m not sure why?

YummYo,False,4,Helps me feel more motivated,"I enjoy using this app & paid for the premium service.

It can be a bit difficult to navigate the app & I missed out on inputting my first two days of success of my morning routine. But I got the hang of it fairly quickly. I’ve only used it for a couple of weeks but I believe these small incremental changes will help me live a healthier life. As someone who is completely unmotivated, Fabulous gives me a much-needed push. It may seem a bit metaphysical & new agey & some of the coaching sessions are downright treacly.

As someone in the field of behavioral psychology and education, once I heard this app concentrated on behavioral science, I knew I had to get it. I like that it starts off slow with one goal of drinking water and gradually adds more with praise and nice incentives for those who like stories. I greatly enjoy the theme. It reminds me of the game “Journey” by Thatgamecompany. It’s one of my favorite games and I’m unsure if the similarities were on purpose, but I love that it works with my association with the game nonetheless! I’m confident this app will be added to my conditioning tools considering it’s already getting me to drink water in a relaxing manner, which is one thing I struggle with lol.

After looking through some posts in the in-app networking feature, many other people also have this glitch. I know it’s not the most important thing ever, but if your team created the content, I’m kinda bummed to think that a glitch is keeping people from enjoying it.

Another thing I want to point out, is that the app is super non judgmental. if you missed a habit for a day or two, it reminds you that it is okay. It’s okay to slip up sometimes! and there’s no need in feeing bad about yourself over it. 
Also, it allows you to build your habits one at a time, which increases the chances of it sticking with you for the rest of your life.

The illustrations and story are AMAZING!! And very inspiring. However, I found that since this app doesn’t use Siri Shortcuts, doesn’t talk with Apple Health, because it seems so technically isolated on my phone, it was hard to not to think of my Fabulous habits as isolated and separate from my everyday “normal life”. This app does a wonderful job of utilizing the psychology of positive habits; I think this app could be taken to the next level by applying some of the psychological principles of how we relate to our phones, why we prioritize our relationships with our phones so highly.

I’ve enjoyed my journey so far, and am discovering that I had the potential to do what I want all along.

I would definitely recommend this app especially if u wanna set yourself a routine for each day. I only have 1 comment, I just really wish we can add our own habits/tasks/goals!

I started from square 1 and this has helped me so much. 

The little things in this app help you the most, it starts by telling you to put a glass of water by your bed every night or in the morning (whatever time you chose it to notify you) and if you go through with it...after a week you start to feel pretty good about yourself and are inspired to keep up the good work.

I love what the app is attempting though, and the mystery it presents and immerses you in. I just think it needs to be simplified.

Since this app seems to target individuals who are working on themselves and may be experiencing mental health challenges I think it’s important to add a little “grace” and “gentleness” in this app- maybe in the form of a bot that’s understanding and not pushy about reaching your goals.

I sometimes wish I could go back and listen to certain daily coaching when the day has passed but I feel that’s the point because maybe it’s a practice of mindfulness and moving forward.

Also the checking off of tasks or goals is weirdly arranged. Is it a check off or a fabulous moment? Or both? The coaching and other extras are also oddly placed. I’m hoping navigating the app becomes easier for me cause I’m really loving the results. For the record, I’m very tech savvy.

It’s a shame that distracting, messy, unclear design was chosen over functionality (exactly what people who need this app need). 

It also asked me what I want to stop using in the questionnaire, social media was one of only 2 options so I picked that, anything I do on this app it asks me to share on social media. I downloaded this app to improve myself, Im not interested in giving you free advertising, and that shouldn’t be on the table anyway for a user that has flagged social media as a trouble area.

Perhaps worst of all is that It has faux science, for example, it based a bad habit section on astrology, apparently I drink too much coffee since I’m a Gemini. I’m serious this was in the app, very very very disappointing for a ‘science based’ app

Perhaps you don’t know what “forward” means or is.

Fabulous has done work on that and can help you select your path / journey; but, get this, also help you re-direct your journey (even just temporarily) when need be.

You can't add more than 4 habits to your list unless you pay for premium.

You cant go back to the morning/afternoon if you forget to check off the habit then (even though you did it) which then messes up your progress through the app (which allows you to unlock extra habits and features)

- It starts you out with easy to attain goals
- There’s a social aspect (though the post I submitted was lost and there’s no where to view your own posts)
- let’s you customize your routines (can’t seem to delete the one you want though, at least for me. Submitted this to support and waiting for a response still)
- a lot of variety to choose from for adding to your routines
- comes with challenges (like cutting sugar, alcohol and even live challenges that let you participate with others)
- not toxic positivity 

Cons:
- There’s a social aspect 
- the reminders could be more “pushy” 
- support is lackluster
- the price is pretty high and in my trial so far I’ve yet to see the $50/year value (but I still have a few days left)

L. DeLuca,False,3,Immersive view is not great if you have ADHD,"I wanted to like Fabulous, because I really need routines in my day. I have ADHD and forming habits has been a life long struggle. 

The biggest issue is the immersive view. The idea behind it is great, but it is more cluttered and distracting than the list view. There’s a banner at the top encouraging me to take notes, a timer, music, artwork, sounds for everything, and like 3 banners at the bottom I couldn’t even process at that point. 

Secondly, the app keeps you from doing most things until you have read a lesson and answered a question about whether you agree. They also play cute videos at the end to tell you about your journey. Theoretically, that should improve your commitment to your goal. In practice, it acts as a distracting barrier to the routine. 

If I’m doing my morning or night routine, I’m already multitasking by using an app. I don’t need it demanding extra cognitive bandwidth on top of that.

A few things however I don’t quite understand.  In none of your emails or messages is there a name at the end.  It’s a bit impersonal I find.   Or are you trying to play ones future self?
Also, the daily coaching is done with such a calm and empathetic voice.  When I got to the exercises I was so surprised about the commanding tone in the instructors’ voice.  Is it on purpose to stimulate ones willpower?

It constantly shows 6 notifications & when I check the app, there is no clear indication of what the notifications are. The menu path is winding rather than logical. When I don’t want to do something the app wants me to do, there is no way out of the prompt other than closing the entire app. I’d like to explore it further, but the billing criticisms are a concern.

dfrankhauser,False,4,I love this dang app,"It really does help get you to start what you've set out to do, and using scientifically backed techniques, it sets the foundation of what will help make you the best person you can be.

My only complaint is a tiny one that's kind of like ""well now you're just being picky"", but I do sort of wish that we could save the daily journals and reflections to view later. I've been in the app for over a year and there have been so many wonderful quotes that I wish I could just pull them all up at once, but they currently disappear into the abysess. To be able to go into the archives and look back on all that you've achieved and seen would be phenomenal.

But really, I drink water when I get out of bed, my nightly routine is stronger, I'm eating healthier, I'm exercising daily-- and I can thank this app for helping me form those habits.

Maybe it’s my age (40) —I guess the app is designed for young people who find it really intuitive. (But I’m not new to using apps, either!)

MsJinny,False,5,Beautiful and well researched,"I like to set goals, but often don’t meet them. I start off strong and then let it just kind of fade. The good thing about Fabulous is that they won’t let you start off and be overly ambitious. Ridiculously easy goals to start and then they add just a little more. The idea is to boost your confidence so you know you really can complete a goal.

Not only can I customize how much and what I take on, the app (wisely) encourages moderation. The app is clearly designed for a certain, more privileged, segment of the population. As such, it is missing powerful dimensions that would tap more fully into my spirit and motivation. Perhaps there will be some evolution there.

It was this App.
I didn’t realize how much using it helped me stay on a healthy path.

I still enjoy “screen time” however

Unfortunately, the app does a real bad job at counting the days. It will skip some days even though I checked them (and I can go back up to 7 days and actually verify that it was indeed properly reported, but the Golden Triangle diagram would show it as a miss).

It’s frustrating because you cannot edit the past days when the software does that kind of mistakes.

I contacted support a couple of time about it and it took forever for them to give me a half baked answer. I don’t think they care about that issue.

Edit: after a few more months of using, the bugs are not improving. The counting of the days is all over the place. The app helped me, but I won’t be renewing because of that major flaw.",2021-06-03 00:19:23,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

It’s really sad because I payed the anual subscription. 

It’s just so annoying to receive a thousand notifications from Instagram, Facebook but none of Fabulous. 
It’s important to me because the first thing I do in the morning is checking my phone and not being able to see a single notification from this app when I activated all of them makes me very confused and I forget the app even exists. (I tried activating the notifications on settings as well) 

If someone knows how to fix this problem I will rate it 5*",2021-04-25 04:28:36,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

In honesty, this is my second day using the app and in my opinion it’s already starting to ease my mind and I feel relaxed for once. IConstantly think about death (not suicide but just the feeling after) or everything else around me. I never think about myself I honestly never journaled before and I’ve been to therapist but they never help. When I downloaded this app I honestly think it was just gonna be like every other app but I can honestly say it’s not this morning when I started logging my habits or habits I want to begin it says reminders for each thing and it will not let me add unless it warned me that too many habits to start with can make me overwhelmed and I never seen an app that had it to where I can see the support that the creators actually give until now.I never thought I can get my life in order but this app is helping me see that I can possibly do otherwise that if I feel like I have a problem with myself which I do feel that way just because of my mental disorders I can see that I can change my life around and hopefully not have to suffer from anxiety and depression the others will always be there but I’m hoping that I can change the small parts about myself that will eventually become bigger. And I honestly want to thank the creators for creating this app and I highly recommend!",2021-04-13 23:17:46,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

amos8086,False,4,Pretty good,"I feel there are many things this app can help with. Especially in the new year resolution area. Mine was to be more aware of what I wasn’t taking advantage of and setting routines for a better, more productive life. I always say I will take care of something, or I need to work out, or I wish I could have more time for me. This app, so far, is starting slowly to get me into that mindset of setting a routine daily. Now, there are some quirks to the app as how fast it may be taking you, and it really depends on your life, when you get up, and what your schedule looks like daily. This is more driven for people working the 9-5 jobs, whereas I work 6-3. I really hope this works to help me in my continued growth, and I’m learning slowly to change my life for the best one yet. 

I understand what they are aiming to do with the app, just wish it would stretch the challenges a little farther, instead of 3 days and a new routine, maybe every 5-7 days so I can get used to the idea of say, drinking water every morning. I like taking it slow, getting used to the idea, manipulating it and being excited about it, but within 7 days I’ve got 4 things they want me to be doing before going into work! Plus, maybe I’m not seeing all of the options, but I wish I could opt out of a challenge or snooze it for just a few days, let me get my head wrapped around the idea of my new routine, then I can progress with my journey. I have purchased the premium membership, I plan on using this to help me with my routines and mindsets, and I am committed to using the app. So just little things I’ve seen after the 7 initial days.

Overall, I believe in the end this will help me, but I do see where some won’t benefit and see it as more a burden daily. It’s a daily app that wants you to be committed, so if you’re not fully ready for a change, don’t purchase the premium, but definitely try the app out! They give you 7 day free trial, and with that it seems like the best app I’ve seen to help with self improvement. To a better 2021!",2021-01-05 17:35:33,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

BeesKnees1750,False,3,Customer service - NOT,"I've used Fabulous for years and absolutely love it... when it works, but customer support seems non-existent when it doesn't. On the one hand, it has worked for me most of the time, but it recently broke when I migrated to a new phone. Short version of the break - As long as I stay on my current journey I'm fine, but when I try to switch to a new challenge it requires me to sign in to my account (which I'm already signed into) and then it freezes. This is in spite of having followed the instructions for switching to a new device. I get that things happen, but the only option for customer support is an email in the app and responses are extremely slow, if you even get a response. I know because this is the third time I've contacted support. The first time they took weeks before getting back to me and the second request was a simple question that I sent them four days ago and haven't heard back. So, I'm not surprised I haven't heard from them in 24 hours about the break, but I am more frustrated this time because this issue prevents me from fully using the app. I will add that when I asked on the app's FB page the simple question about what time of day daily coaching was posted, my post was disapproved, within just a few hours, the moderator told me it was inappropriate for the FB group's purpose, and I was directed to use the help function in the app, which of course has received no response. Bottom line - It's great for setting up routines and developing new habits but for its price customer service is woefully lacking.",2021-06-08 13:55:10,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

MonzillaxoBride,False,3,I can’t say I’m feeling too Fabulous,"I agree with one of the other users who suggested allowing you to say “I already do this habit” would be helpful. If that’s the case I’m okay with keeping the habit, but amp it up with another option. The story telling is nice, but I’m not feeling super motivated by it. I like the quotes much better where I can journal my thoughts alongside it. I also really like the guides and other suggestions that pop up that I can even quickly post on Instagram or save in my phone. However, I am currently having a hard time even locating them at the moment. I could have sworn yesterday there was a way for me to go back to them. I would prefer prompts that keep me more interested and then have a place to go back to and access them again or a place where I can better see my daily progress outside of just the journey prompt with the habits. I’m not sure that I’ll keep the subscription after the 7 day trial. It’s a nice app and I do like being forced to slow down and ease into the goals since I’m often overloading myself with goals, but I don’t feel that challenged. You can’t build on a challenge and keep the habit, but maybe that’s the point that I’m not fully grasping. I’m not fully bought in because it hasn’t fully peaked my interest. It would be nice if the app maybe asked a series of questions and tried to learn a little more about you before it forced you into a specific set of habits to follow that may not apply to you. I have tried other apps that I like much better. This one is falling short for me. I’m on day 5 of 7 and will stay optimistic.",2021-04-15 11:50:25,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

LunaTh3Pup,False,5,Truly Amazing!!,"This game is absolutely amazing. I would recommend for all ages. Although paid version offers good stuff, can use perfectly well without paying anything.

Features:

1. Daily goals:

Fabulous offers daily goals in the best way possible. Not only are the beautiful artistic drawings customized to each routine, but there is tranquil and calming music playing through each. Once a routine is done, you hit a check mark and it moves to the next until you finish.

2. Fabulous moment:

This app offers a really cool feature called a fabulous moment. It runs you through the daily goals and then plays a tidbit of a story (totally optional) and let’s you see a bit more each day. This is great motivation to come back and really fun.

3. Letters:

Fabulous sends you letters of encouragement and even letters from your future self (if you enable them) which I personally love.

4. Fabulous community:

Though I personally opted out of joining the fabulous community (parents if you don’t want your kids to have social media you can use the app completely social media free) just to distance myself from social media, but it really is a great community. If you want to talk about issues or find a wholesome community of people with similar experiences, this app is for you.

5. Fabulous premium.

Fabulous premium is amazing. But the thing I LOVE ABOUT THIS APP is that you can use it and use it well without paying ANYTHING. Please consider trying this app, it has really changed me for the better.",2021-04-11 12:00:54,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

shesbellacole,False,5,Beautiful App,"To the creators of this app, thank you. You’ve already helped me so much when I didn’t think I could be helped at this point. 

I’ve been really struggling lately with my mental health and focus due to several factors including a breakup, debt with no job, and being kicked out of school (attendance issues, also due to deteriorating mental health). It’s gotten so bad that my suicidal thoughts have come back for the first time since I was 16 (I am currently a 20y old woman), and my mom has urged me to seek out therapy and medication for the first time in my life because I’m worrying my family so much. I’ve been isolating to an extreme degree, losing an unhealthy amount of weight due to not eating, and crying at uncontrollable intervals.
Then I found this app, and about 6 days in, I have HOPE. I feel like I am actually capable of taking control and making a change. It starts slow enough that if you’re already struggling with the small tasks, you won’t feel overwhelmed. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and there’s a “zen mode” for completing your daily tasks that I like to use  as a meditative state which leaves me feeling a little lighter after (not much, a realistic amount, meditation isn’t a miracle worker). The app could be organised a little better, I was able to find my way around the app easily but for those that aren’t as savvy with technology it would probably be a little confusing. 
And no, I was not paid to review this, I actually came into the app store by my own will to write this. I wish this was a paid review. I could really do with some cash haha. 
I wish I could give this app more praise. More than 5 stars. I’m considering purchasing the lifetime subscription which is like $200 something, when I get the money for it. That’s how much I think this app is worth it.",2021-03-17 14:40:15,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Momof2MessiGirls,False,1,Watch out! They will try to catch you off guard,"So this app, depending on where or how you download it will come with either a 7 day, 30 day or even a 90 day free trial and then will charge you $40 for the year even if you will never use it if you find out it’s not for you. They do NOT send any kind of reminder of upcoming charge email likely looking to catch people not into the app off guard. (I’ve checked and checked and there’s not even a confirmation of payment email even a week later. Had to find out via my monthly budgeting) Their messages eventually give a cold “it was on your original agreement” so sorry about your bad luck. They do not answer any emails asking for refunds manually. You never speak to a real person. You get sent to a type-form survey that will only give you a refund it seems if you have just been charged within 48 hours (maybe) even if you missed it or if they could easily check to see if you ever even used the app. It would seem that good people created this app until you see how little they care about those who tried it but it didn’t work for them. Seems weird to make getting a refund so difficult and alerting your subscribers they’re about to be charged so nonexistent. If you do try this app pay close attention to which trial you signed up for.  I thought mine was 90 days since that was the trial they allowed me to share with friends but I was wrong. It was 30 days and now I’m stuck with an app that I will not use again because they send no reminder and no confirmation of payment email. Not even a partial refund for time spent. Just a full year charge and the icky taste of underhanded business practices in my mouth. Ugh.",2021-04-14 16:40:23,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

ExhaustedAthena,False,5,So much more than a habit app!,"First of all, the fabulous app is based on research, which I love. 
It has structured “journeys” that guide you to establish habits progressively at a pace that won’t overwhelm you and cause you to give up. The habits build on each other such that establishing the one habit increases your likelihood of following through with the next habit.
Habits are grouped into “routines”. The morning routine helps me get out of bed and have a good productive day. The evening routine helps me wind down and sleep well. You can add more routines like afternoon, work, etc. And you can add custom habits to any routine. You can also add reminders. 
Like other habit apps, the fabulous app tracks your progress. You can look at your streak to motivate you to keep going. 
The fabulous app also gives you the tools you need for many habits. There are guided workouts, guided meditation, timers similar to the pomodoro method to study/work, bedtime stories and music to drift into sleep, and many other tools so that you can complete the habits without switching to another app. 
Also, there are optional challenges and groups you can join to get motivated by other people with the same goals. 
Overall, an amazing app that helps me everyday. I have tried many other apps to track my habits but this is the only app that guides me to do it at a pace and order that will help me succeed. My mental and physical health have significantly improved thanks to this app. 
After the free trial, you can continue to use the app for free with limited capabilities. I do think the paid version is worth the cost. It is $40 per year and you definitely get a lot out of it. But even the free version is so much better than any other app I’ve tried, free and paid.",2021-04-18 17:27:41,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

krismouse,False,3,Okay so far,"The Daily Coaching is excellent. The Habits/Routines building is also pretty good. The UI takes some getting used to. For example, the first thing in the Morning Routine is “drink water” but the things at the top of your Home Screen are a journal prompt and Daily Coaching. So it seems out of order. 

The Circles feature is a good idea poorly executed. Each Circle is a topic area with F*ceb**k style posts, but you get no notifications if anyone replies to your post and good luck finding your post again because only recent posts are displayed. And once you’ve scrolled down to the bottom and not found your post, there’s no way to pop back to the top of the feed; you’re gonna scroll scroll scroll aaaaaall the way back up. I’m not sure how Circles is supposed to foster conversation when it’s so hard to use. You don’t even get notified if people like your post, so how are you supposed to draw encouragement if you don’t know who “likes” you?

There’s so much going on in this app it’s easy to get confused. For example, there’s a Challenges section, but you can’t do a Journey and a Challenge at the same time, and you’re placed in a Journey when you start using the app—so why doesn’t the app hide Challenges until you’ve finished your first Journey? The app will say in one place }go slow and add one Habit and one Routine at a time,” but then in another place it presents a smorgasbord of options. Feed me one thing at a time or everything at once, but be consistent.

I’m still hoping this app will help me get my shtuff together, but so far it’s going about as well as every other life improvement app I’ve ever tried, which is to say, good but not great. I do like that I can build custom routines, for example start and end workday.",2021-06-12 18:47:26,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Ruby147468543,False,2,"Buggy, incohesive app with Pushy Ads for Premium","This app is great when it works for its Journeys. It it slow to get from one screen to the next when you check off that you've done something as it goes through 1-4 scenes of graphics to congratulate you depending on what all you've finished.

There are a few times throughout the day that what I click on doesn't respond on the main Routine page. I need to re-open the app to get it to work again. Going to a different page and back to Routine does not work.

There are a mysterious 6 ""notifications"" that appear once in a while through my two weeks of use. I contacted support about it and they said it's ""due to a feature they're testing."" ....that seems kinda yikes to ""test"" something on production for that long and not take it down to bug fix.

Anyways. Being a free user is a joke for Journeys. ALL of the Second Mountain Journeys are locked behind Premium. One out of the two Third Mountain is also. This renders the main goal of the building blocks of this app a Premium Only feature.

The app also offers a 30-day pass to Premium Subscription but only through browser. Not the app. It is difficult to navigate cancelling it because of how it's set up. Very predatory ON TOP of the constant in-app ad push for Premium.

Fabulous Moments (semi-guided activities for when you want to do....well anything) are great. There is a short <10min one I liked to use called Blast Off for getting a jumpstart onto tasks. Even something as small content as that is locked to premium. Can't use it anymore after my trial was over.

Aside from these, content outside of Journeys is pretty busy.  Journeys carefully limit you from over extending yourself with Too Many Tasks, however these other sections feel like FOMO breeding grounds for all the things you COULD do that you can get added to your Routine list with your Journeys. Very counterintuitive for these to exist in the same space as a ""building blocks are the key to success"" type of approach.  I can see how these can (and honestly? Should.) be limited to Premium users. It's too much for a new user who doesn't really know exactly what they can learn from the app just yet. 

Anyways. I feel gross finding out I can't even do a Second Mountain, like not even one of them, on Free. It feels like they were just chaining users like me along just to either get Premium or dump the app. Like I'm not mad at the price. It seems reasonable for a well designed app (fix the UI bugs and then it'll actually be worth). The way in which they've fished me along to try to extract it from me by wasting my energy is disgusting, really.

Isb123,False,1,THIS APP SCARRED ME,"So I downloaded this app after seeing an ad on Tik-Tok. It seemed like a great concept, I figured it could help me keep up with healthy habits and routines. Once I downloaded the first thing I decided to try was the morning routine, where my challenge was to drink water first thing when I woke up. It would’ve been more motivating if it had said a certain amount of water. I appreciate starting small but I could literally take one sip of water and check off the box for completing that task for the day. It wasn’t very gratifying and didn’t feel like an accomplishment. The second part of the routine was doing a one minute breathing exercise. I expected it the exercise to just pop up after that prompt but it didn’t. I had to search through the app for a breathing routine and the shortest one was 5 minutes. All of that is allot for me when I’m half awake. So I do the routine and while the narrator’s voice was nice she was talking so fast it actually gave me anxiety instead of relaxing me. I could barely even keep up with her instructions. 

Day two: “let me try something else”, I thought. So I chose the anxiety reduction challenge. The first day I was supposed to write down ways I avoid anxiety. Done. Then it made me choose an activity amongst a few things. One was a mirror pep talk and the other was based on holding myself accountable if I don’t complete the challenge. Kind of weird and aggressive. 

The final and most HORRIBLE part of the app were the stories to choose from! I picked a story that said under the title “it pays to be kind”. Thought it would be cute. The story starts out relaxing. The voice is great. Then it goes on to talk about the protagonist who kills dogs, makes amputees with magic to spite his competitor, has slaves, and in the end of the story kills someone who stole his ring AFTER MARRYING A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL. I can’t make this stuff up y’all. I couldn’t sleep for an hour after listening to the story. I have 5 days left in the free trial so I might continue to use some of the sounds to sleep but I definitely won’t risk listening to another disturbing story. 

My last comment is just that the app pressures you to share with your friends or challenge your friends many times throughout the duration of one use. It gets really annoying. The idea for the app is great but the layout is too complex and the actual processes to build habits are to simple. It needs more development. AND TAKE OFF THE DISTURBING STORIES!",2021-04-21 20:39:03,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

aenietes,False,1,Charged and then Info Deleted,"Do not download this app unless you’re committed to using it for a year. 

The first week of June I saw an ad for Fabulous on Instagram, went to their website and was interested in doing a free trial. Before the end of the 7 day free trial, my account was charged. I noticed that same day and immediately requested reimbursement because I did not enjoy the app and was planning on canceling the subscription before I was supposed to be charged for the full annual rate of $39.99. 

I never heard back but I kept the app to keep proof of the charge on my account. Now a week later, I tried to reach out to the contact team again and got an automated response and my information has been deleted from the app even though I have technically paid for an (unwanted) annual subscription. 

I have been getting notifications that I can’t turn off for some reason and daily emails offering me different deals on other/better “free” trials. 

I really wanted to love this app but the lack of customer service and messaging trying to “get me back” in marketing emails has completely turned me off.",2021-06-24 06:21:47,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Charmoni13,False,1,IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL!,"This looks like a wonderful app. However, during my free trial period,I decided that the habit-building exercises are pretty similar to another program I am doing with my husband. So I have tried to send an email requesting cancellation, but their email is from a “no reply “address. I’ve gone to the help and feedback section on the app, but all their instructions for cancellation have me going around in endless circles. Since I am in the trial period, my iPhone is not showing any active subscriptions to cancel. I do not wish for the premium charge to hit my account and then try to go through whatever steps would be needed to get a refund, if I can even do that. So if the developers are reading this message, please make it easier to cancel the free trial subscription, pretty please.

UPDATE 6/23/21: I sent a message to a Customer Support email address I discovered over two weeks ago and have yet to receive any response to my email. Therefore, I have reduced my rating to one star. The people behind this app are totally non-responsive and now that they have my credit card number, the renewal of this app will probably continue in perpetuity.",2021-06-23 11:35:40,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

After a few days I was very overwhelmed by the app. I struggle with clutter and I felt like the app was just very cluttered. I immediately went to my settings and canceled the subscription so that I would not be charged for the year. On Sunday June 13 I get an email from PayPal stating fabulous has charged me 39.99 I panicked and was so confused because I knew I canceled it. I went to my app and I could not cancel it because I had already canceled. I started to try to find the fabulous customer service number only to be led down a rabbit hole of automated responses. After speaking with my app customer service I realized I was signed up under two different emails which I obviously did not realize I had done or else I would have canceled both in time.

Acequiamadre,False,2,"App didn’t function for months, developer unwilling to resolve the issue","Dear Fab-  I updated you. I redownloaded you.  I reset you from setting just like they told me to. So.many. Times. I read you poetry and sang you songs. I gave you the last piece of Thanksgiving pie. But until two days ago, you refused to even show me my setting, coaching, or journey screen. Nada but white. Customer service guy says our difficulties was all me,  but he also said he had no answers and would chat with the developer, so I know the problem wasn’t just me. Fabulous, it could have been lovely!  I will miss you but I need a more reliable partner!  

When I first started using the premium app it was fine. Then it stopped recording my streaks. I emailed fabulous but did not hear back. After 37 days, this deflated my feeling fabulous bubble. I drifted away from the app after that because it kept loosing my streaks.  It’s a silly thing, but it felt Ike a letdown when your hard work is lost. 

Flash forward by the fall. I thought that I would give it another try, so I started being Fabulous again. The app had some nice improvements like daily coaching. And then the app stopped working completely on my iPhone 7+. I only got blank white screens. I reached out to Fabulous and, well, customer service has been unfabulous. 

 We had the regular update and reinstall conversations. I continued to dutifully send my screenshots showing the issue. Customer service says he will chat with the developer. We go back and forth. Two months pass with several email. Finally, after the last update, and almost three months, I can see all my Fabulous screen! I reach out and request that Fabulous extend my subscription to make up for the fact that the app didn’t work for almost 3 months of the year. First, customer service tells me that they cannot do that there is no way. When I call iTunes they reassured me that this was not the fact. Every developer can issue a courtesy code. I circle back to CS and let him know it is possibility for them to issue a code so that I can continue to use Fabulous, a subscription that I have paid for. I am told Fab won’t extend my subscription because he told me to update the app. I’m confused because that was the first thing he told me to do and the first thing I did. I even sent him an email about it.

If that is the type of journey you want to be on, Fabulous may be the app for you: unreliable app and uneven customer support. Take your chances. If it goes badly, it could be Fabulous.

Update: the customer service fellow and I are in touch. He says he will see if they can extend my subscription but it may take a few weeks to find out. Will fabulous be fabulous or it is just trying to keep me in the hook?

Update: after over eight emails, and waiting four weeks to hear “what they decided” I was offered a code for three months to cover the time my app was not working. The simple (SIMPLE) right thing—yet the amount of work to encourage Fabulous to follow through leaves me with less than a glowing review of their customer service. Now that I get to try the app I am not sure I want to love it; not excited to support a company with their level of customer service.

BlueberryPancakesYum,False,4,"Difficulty restoring paid account, slow customer service, good content","Update 1/24/21

Customer service got back to me and resolved the issue promptly.

Overall, I love the app’s simplicity, both in design and the starting program of habit building. The community element is also welcome. I love the app’s “gamification” of habit building too.

I’d give five stars if they made the transferring of your account to new devices more convenient and seamless.

———

Overall, the app content is good, but I’m rating the app one star because of unresponsive customer service for premium subscribers and difficulty restoring paid subscriptions when switching devices.

After upgrading from an older iPhone to a new one, I lost access to my premium subscription, so I lost all my saved info and do not have access to all the features. This issue seems common enough since there is a section in their FAQ on how to address this, but none of the steps listed worked for me. I also logged in and out of the app, and deleted and reinstalled the app with no success in restoring my premium account. It seems like others have encountered similar issues.

I subscribed to the app from a website, and it seems that restoring your account from a website is not as seamless as restoring access if you subscribed via the app store. There is no convenient existing user login page on the app or on their main website. I had to search for the existing user login page on a web browser to log in. While this is mildly inconvenient, because I do not have access to my account, I have to log in as a first time user and retake the onboarding survey each time, which only takes a minute or two but still frustrating when you have a paid account with them. 

The FAQ also states that they cannot port over subscriptions from Android to iOS, so this might also be an issue for premium subscribers that end up switching to a different OS. In my case, I upgraded from an old iPhone 6s to a new iPhone 12 Pro Max, but I have not been successful in restoring my subscription and saved data. 

Customer service has not yet responded to my issue; I emailed them about 10 days ago from this writing. I received a generic message from them stating that they are receiving a high volume of requests at the moment. I don’t know what the average wait time for a response would be, but, again, this feels like a lot for people that paid for the subscription. 

The gist of this is: I paid money for a subscription, and I’m bummed out because I don’t have access to what I’m paying for. It seems other subscribers have had problems too, so for anyone that is planning on paying for the premium service and upgrading their device or switching between iOS and Android, you may have similar issues.

I was pleased with the content of the app, and I felt that the price was fair. I’d happily rate them higher if I can get my issues resolved.

But the trouble of getting access to my paid account and slow customer service response time may cause me to cancel and get a partial refund if I don’t get this resolved soon.",2021-01-24 20:02:45,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
