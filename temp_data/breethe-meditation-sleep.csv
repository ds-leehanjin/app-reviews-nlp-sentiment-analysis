I really enjoy the stories and all the other content too. However I can only give it four stars because of the whispered stories. They are very hard to listen to and it is not relaxing at all trying to concentrate on something that should be easy to hear. In addition I wish they weren’t mixed in with the normal hearing sleep stories, perhaps they could have their own section because it’s frustrating to go through the whispered stories since they are not usable to me. It’s also disappointing that there’s so many great titles in the whispered stories and I will never be able to hear those ones. Please also consider recording whispered stories also as regular hearing stories.

The daily breathers are short and sweet so I do them almost every single day, but lately I find them less appealing. The whole “think about someone you love... now think about someone you’re neutral towards, etc ” approach not only makes for a really distracting meditation, but also makes me examine my relationships instead of looking inward. When I meditate, I try to calm the monkey mind - not feed it by thinking about the different people in my life. I already do that enough! Please pull back in that approach and guide us in the here-and-now instead like you use to. I was questioning whether or not I should subscribe to another year, but the last few months have made me think that I may not.

If you have any kind of anxiety, want to learn meditation, need help sleeping, need help getting started in the A.M., need help with patience with someone you live with, or for so many concerns.... this app is IT.  

Though most tapes are non religiously oriented, there are plenty that are. 
There’s prayers for wake up a, for bedtime, or any time. Prayers for help, for thanks, learning gratitude, inner peace, releasing pain, and learning to feel the Lord around me and to show his grace in the day’s interactions.
I’ve been listening for a month and feel it’s responsible for my increased energy and happiness.

I wanted to start meditating to calm my nerves and reactions so I downloaded this to try. I fell in love with it from the first day. I listened almost everyday as soon as I woke up. It made me feel so much better. Guided me on how to meditate bc I was a newby and had no idea what I was doing.  This app made me look inside myself and calmly deal with my internal problems as well as calmed my reactions to things and my complete outlook on life really. I was happier and calmer. I lived in the moment instead of worrying. But, I stopped listening when my soon to be ex cut my phone off and I had to get a new phone. I was just dealing with all of that drama, my kids and the holidays it was awful. I’ve had a rough week or so and I needed something to calm my nerves and make me focus. Then I remembered this app and immediately downloaded it. I have listened this morning and already feel a bit calmer. I have missed this app and when the 14 day free trial is up I am going to pay the $89.99/yr subscription fee Bc I can not go without this app again. I need it in my life on a daily basis. Period.  Thank you to whoever created it and all of the meditation help. Thank you for saving my life. Twice.",2021-02-03 16:41:16,AmberNYoung1983@,breethe-meditation-sleep,920161006

Even though I didn’t buy it.

So you can download this app it’s okay for me but.. not a huge fan😂 so it’s great but I sleep well.so guys I’m just telling you how I feel about the app. Not that I’m telling the owner they did a bad job.
