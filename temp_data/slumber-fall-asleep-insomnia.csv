"I‚Äôve used slumber for almost a year. Some of the narrators I like better than other, which is why being able to search by narrator is handy. They choice of stories is great, short stories to narratives that are a couple hours long. You can also learn something while listening, they have stories to take you to other countries or teach you about history, and some are just for fun. The sounds relaxing music is nice too but I still prefer to listen to the stories, with soft music in the background. There are even children‚Äôs stories for parent who need something to help their little ones fall asleep. Less expensive than other apps and I kinda of prefer not having ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù voices which make me start thinking about their movies or something instead of focusing on the story.",Great app for sleep,5,2021-05-12 14:51:26,False,Allykatrose,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,
"Slumber has a lot of the typical travel log type stories, some badly written formulaic story-like offerings, relaxation type meditations and these may be fine for many people to fall asleep. They also have a few of my favorites: wonderful voices reading very well written material. Some of these include The Jungle Book, Sherlock Holmes, The Wizard of Oz, etc. One of my very favorite readers, Abby Offer (sp? Sorry Abbie?) is found here but I wish she read better material. The guy who reads about the Norse gods, and the French Whisperer along with several others are excellent. If you want these readers, Slumber is a good second app to the best one, which eclipses them all with hundreds of thousands of free meditations and a sleep section far larger than any other entire app: Insight Timer.

I‚Äôm a psychiatrist and recommend this app to patients with sleep trouble regularly. I myself have been using it for a couple of years now and have listened to over 700 sessions so far and continue to love how it‚Äôs developed over time. I now have a nursing newborn and this program is a lifesaver when trying to get back to sleep after a night waking. The premium subscription has been worth it for the variety offered and the regularly new content. The customer service has been great. I can‚Äôt say enough positive about Slumber. It has definitely changed the sleep game for me. I highly recommend using sleep headphones with it.

"I have a special needs child who has difficulty falling asleep. Slumber has changed all that, and there is less ‚Äòdrama‚Äô at bedtime, due to the variety of stories and how well the stories are presented. New stories are added on a regular basis, so we don‚Äôt have to keep cycling through the same ones.
   One thing I‚Äôd like to see added is a way to know which new stories were recently added, such as a counter showing how many times the given story was selected / played, by the individual user. This would also help determine which stories may be favorites or less favorite. Ordering options by most frequently played vs least played would be very helpful.",Great Variety of Stories,4,2021-01-05 03:07:05,False,rmesoo,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,
"I've been using this app without a subscription for months and I LOVE it. I can only listen to the free stories/sounds, which rotate every once in a while. 

There are so many types of sleep stories to choose from. They vary from adventures, to travel, to boring stuff like bird migration (honestly my fave) and different voices tell each story. 

You can add background noises such as a calming music, running river, crickets chirping, fire crackling, a ceiling fan, and a few others. It gets even cooler because you can adjust the volume of each sound individually! For example, I like my sleep story to have low music, fire crackling and river flowing in the background. 

You can set the story to play once, repeat twice, or infinity times. I like to set it for 2x just in case it takes me a while to fall asleep. The app also has an optional bedtime reminder notification. 

Definitely no need for subscription (use the FREE stories!) although I may invest in a subscription considering I use the app every night for bed.","Awesome sleep app, FREE section is plenty",5,2021-03-02 03:56:16,False,ToriRose11,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

The trick is to try to stay awake, and you‚Äôll fall asleep. It it turns out, however, that there‚Äôs also a podcast that has almost all the same stuff, and more, at least the stories.  So I feel kind of silly having paid for this. I don‚Äôt really need the soothing music as there are hundreds of those on streaming services. The podcast is called get sleepy.

I thought that hearing voices while trying to fall asleep would not work‚Äîbut it does. The stories are great because I dont like typical meditations that force me to focus on my body, breath, etc. because I want to GET OUT of my achey body.

"Has helped me fall asleep, highly recommend. Calm has lots of different things, whereas slumber focuses more on just sleep stories - a relaxing narrator telling a relaxing story. These are not only fiction ‚Äústories‚Äù - my favorite are the science or history based ones - for example, teaching you about prehistoric structures. My favorite narrators are ‚Äúthe French whisperer‚Äù and Abbe Opher.

"Edit: Editing this review because, while I appreciate that they actually have been adding new free stories like I suggested, they have locked previously free ones. My all time favorite was the Birds of Yosemite. Great narrator, beautiful musings about nature, and it is now locked. Previously permanent free stories should be grandfathered in, even if new free ones since the change are on a rotating basis (idk if they are but i cant think of why else they would lock old free ones). Dreams of Grasmere is also locked now and that one was also pretty successful at helping me sleep. Sidenote, I just checked the premium price and its now $40/yr, which is not as ridiculous a price as it was before

- - -
This app is fantastic, the stories help my brain focus on the narrative rather than a bunch of inner chaotic thoughts, which helps me fall asleep. I especially love The Birds of Yosemite, which seems to be a reading of an actual published journal of some sort. And it has such rich and beautiful descriptions and the narrator does a wonderful job. The optional sound effects & mixing are also very subtle & pleasant. HOWEVER I have to knock my review down a whole two stars because there is such a small handful of free episodes. Only someone with a superfluous amount of spending money would pay $10/mo for a single sleep app, as much as it may help their (my) chronic insomnia. I would love to fall asleep to more nature journals, or more simple stories like The Cats Journey, but there has not been a single new free episode in the months I‚Äôve had this app. And the problem with listening to the same stories over and over is that your brain starts to tune them out because they are familiar, and instead becomes overrun with thoughts once again and stays awake. If the devs would consider at least releasing ONE new free story for every 5 or 10 new locked stories (new locked stories get released at an impressive rate), I would easily give the app 5 stars.",(NEW EDIT) Good app BUT,3,2021-03-01 07:52:14,False,Xhfeu,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

"This, now, this, is crossing the line. These stories and background noises and completely unreal! I love the attention to detail in each and every one of these books. So far, my two favorites are The White Cat and The Sleepy Caterpillar. My little brother LOVED The Sleepy Caterpillar, and fell asleep almost instantly after his beloved bedtime story. I personally like The White Cat the best. The daring story of a princess journeying to a Cat Kingdom, befriending cats of all kinds, and a great rescue kept me awake all the way through it, but I did eventually fall asleep. I am a very rough sleeper. I‚Äôm terrible at falling asleep, and sometimes it takes hours. This has put me asleep so quickly, and this is only my first day using it! Me and my family are about to go on a LONG trip to California, and I will definitely listen to these stories while on the road. It‚Äôs strange, but road noises seem to soothe me...

Dear Abbe Opher,
Hello! I am 10 years old, and I really like your The White Cat story. I am super excited to hear your other stories, and I‚Äôd like to say, your voice is very soothing! Keep up your great work. ‚úåüèªü•≥üåü.    Sincerely, Catelyn Calvert in Texas

Dear Nadine Brown,
Hello! I am 10 years old, and I love your The Sleepy Caterpillar story! It put my brother to sleep, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs waking up anytime soon. The serenity of being a caterpillar sounds so soothing and nice; the chocolate acorns, bird siblings, and the sleepy cocoon. It makes me think of what it REALLY would be like. Your story was the first story I heard on this app, and I thank, thank, thank you for getting my brother to sleep. He‚Äôs a little ball of energy and won‚Äôt stop talking.   Sincerely, Catelyn Calvert in Texas
