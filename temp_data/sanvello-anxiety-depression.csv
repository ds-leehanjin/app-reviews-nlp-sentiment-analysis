And the first step was using Sanvello. My anxiety is getting so much better, and I‚Äôve completely engaged in social activities and started dabbling in minimalism for my sake of OCD.
Next, the committee section. I have made so many allies and good advice givers here. The report section is top-notch, and I can find people with fellow interests without being afraid of internet bullying, homophobic people, and etc. I seriously don‚Äôt deserve the kindness here. 
Lastly, the shorts. I personally enjoy Garden Mark, where he talks about plans, moving on, and other things while you see him tending to his plants. It keeps me focused but also calm! 
The only thing I dislike is I‚Äôm not able to pay 10$ a month for more lessons. Please either lower the price or stop premium! People with mental health issues should have less expensive options! 
Overall, mostly fantastic app, and anyone, and I mean ANYONE, who has stress should get this app.",HeyYallItsKawaiiKunüëª,2021-03-16 01:10:11,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861
5,False,User of 6 years and I can‚Äôt recommend enough,,"Sanvello (previously Pacifica) is the perfect app for improving mood, CBT, and anger management. I have used this app for nearly 6 years (since I was 12 or 13) and I have had a positive experience with it every year of use. 

The best unique features of this app currently include: (in order of what I like most)

‚Ä¢In-Depth Mood Tracking and feelings log
‚Ä¢Health Habit Tracking (Sleep, meals, exercise, etc.) and this even has the option to make custom bad habits like nail biting or smoking.
‚Ä¢Specified anonymous forums/group chats for peer-to-peer support with many different struggles 
‚Ä¢Automatic weekly check ins (short quiz to determine levels of anxiety, depression, etc.)
‚Ä¢Small library of great meditations for various situations you might be facing. 

... and as usual, more premium features are available for a subscription. Even though subscriptions are available and recommend, I have used this app for six whole years and never felt like I was lacking the tools that this app provides to help improve my life. So this app definitely gets the award of ‚Äòbest option for free mental health services‚Äô by a LONG shot. 

SAnvello is just sooooo much better than other apps like it, because it seems like they genuinely care about your mental health by making the most important tools free to everyone to use and take advantage of. ‚ù§Ô∏è",Heral0204,2021-03-07 20:24:03,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861

As far as assessments, I like them. They‚Äôre diverse enough to get me started without being overwhelming. As a dftba fan, I couldn‚Äôt help but love that they used John Green for one of the anxiety educational videos. Every other person or voice they use is soothing and not ‚Äúover doing it.‚Äù I‚Äôm interested by the community feature, but I don‚Äôt use it as much as the activities. 

As far as UX, just a couple things: some buttons are not compatible with iPhone features, for example, the adjust volume slider is too close to the bottom of the screen, and so my phone thinks I want to swipe away from the app or close it.

First it makes me choose a theme. Stars seems nice! No, it spins at a pace that dizzied me and confused my brain. I quickly chose another. Lightning? That means constant flashing! Turns out none of the themes aren‚Äôt animated (at a weird rapid pace - if they were slow they wouldn‚Äôt bother me nearly so much.) So right off the bat, I‚Äôm frustrated. 

Then some of the text is barely readable against the background, for some reason? Black text against the theme background, in a few different screens. 

I get it that the lessons talk about the causes of anxiety, although apparently, according to this app, all of them are external? Let me tell you, my brain does a great job of giving me internal reasons to be anxious. But then it repeated it during the breathing exercise. I don‚Äôt want to think about the causes of my anxiety when I‚Äôm trying to clear my mind. Why even mention it there? I didn‚Äôt even make it three minutes into the seven minute relaxation because I kept getting angry at the relaxation exercise. 

I don‚Äôt know if it gets better at all, but just the basic stuff seems to frustrate me way more than relax me. These shouldn‚Äôt be roadblocks. Stick to lessons during lessons and relaxation during breathing exercises. Fix your visual stuff.

I feel calmer and incredibly tired now, and I think that fatigue is from finally relaxing after being so very anxious for so very long. I cannot afford a therapist, so I never had any tools to manage my anxiety. This app has taught me those tools.

I managed to build up the strength to get a session scheduled. I was excited!

Sanvello charged me 120 dollars for the initial consultation. After going through and answering many personal questions and medical history we were closing up. They determined that they would be unable to help me and I should find a different provider.

They did not give me phone numbers, or offer to help. They simply abandoned me with a bill telling me to go else where.

I‚Äôm sure they had reasons, legal an other reasons they are asked to tell high risk patients this. I find this hugely unethical knowing how difficult it is for those struggling to ask for health, to leave them worse off then they came.

Under no circumstance would I ever recommend Sanvello for this reason. If they were to give free consultations rather than scamming the worst hurting people out of money and denying service I would change this review. For now my advice is to avoid. Sanvello left me worse than when I first tried it, without help and with an additional bill.

When writing review it is white text on white background.(Copy and pasting text from elsewhere made it black text on white background.)

The Basic free version help ends with no warning making me feel more abandoned.

Why can‚Äôt you get grants or donations instead of telling people they have to pay to live when they are at their worst? 

Ask for some of the INSANE amount of tax payer money wasted on weapons of war? No? 

Just going to continue to glorify BROKEN money?

Money means nothing without people. :/ :/ :/

I hate money.

Plenty of cultures are happy without money - $$$ doesn‚Äôt actually need to exist.

Why can‚Äôt the part of the app to be paid for be the interaction with doctors?

Poor people or those having trouble with insurance just supposed to suffer more?

The doctor that created insulin sold the patent for 1$ because ‚Äúit is unethical to profit off of saving lives.‚Äù 

Some doctors still today take whatever compensation people can give because they also think it is unethical to profit off saving lives.

Many parts of the app are pay only or insurance. Medical insurance is so broken and messed up that often makes me think they want me to die. 

Some parts that are paid only aren‚Äôt clear - don‚Äôt show desperate people what they can‚Äôt have is more humane.

Seeing posts of other users being happy is more depressing when depressed.

It doesn‚Äôt help to tell someone that doesn‚Äôt have friends or family‚Ä¶ to talk to friends or family. Some friends or family are what people need to get away from.

Many of the things the user has to reply ‚ÄúYep‚Äù to are too generic and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have another button or just do ‚Äúnext‚Äù and not have the user confused with something that they don‚Äôt actually agree with.

The ‚Äúhelps‚Äù or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt help‚Äù needs an unsure option.

 The one in which focused on thinking about positive memories very much was ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt help‚Äù it made me cry the entire time because I have no positive memories that aren‚Äôt corrupted with pain.

Feel dumb for telling someone this app helped when only a few days in going to delete it already.

Came to this app because I have no other options right now. All the other apps were completely horrible or pay only.

And no, I don‚Äôt agree that all people can control their thoughts with willpower and practice alone.

Great to know I fall in all the mental traps ‚Äú that aren‚Äôt based in reality.‚Äù :/ :/ :/ 

Few parts needed more examples or instructions instead of the user trying to point out which they thought was the case.",xedftyuiop,2021-06-27 19:08:01,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861
