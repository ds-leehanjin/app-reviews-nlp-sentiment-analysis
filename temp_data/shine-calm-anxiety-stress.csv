5,2021-01-07 22:55:25,A MUST HAVE after 2020,False,"Like pretty much everyone else, I noticed my mental health had a deep decline in the fall and winter months. I already suffer from anxiety and I knew I needed to make some changes in my life, but I wasn’t sure where to start or what app might be best. I have had one other meditation app in the past and went to use it again, but I was frustrated with the pay wall so I kept searching, hoping I could find something that would also help me set intentions for what I want to get out of my practice. I was especially interested in something that would correspond between meditation and sleep, as I have been experiencing sleep problems in recent months which are completely new to me.

I am so thankful and happy to have come across Shine! The structure of the app is both easy to navigate for simple daily use, but also wonderful to explore deeper practices. I really enjoy having bios of all the speakers, as it makes me feel more connected to who I am taking time to meditate with.I literally just downloaded the app two and a half days ago, so I haven’t had as much time to explore all the features and benefits but I’m already cooked.

Speaking back to the paywall, I was even more excited to learn that this is a minority and female owned company, so I had zero hesitation in paying for premium. The cost is about the same for many other apps, so why not support the awesome women behind this fantastic app?!?!!",SillyR1015,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2020-12-09 14:54:58,The shine app is a must-have,False,"I absolutely love the shine app. It’s so thoughtfully and intentionally curated with targeted daily meditations and so much more. It is extremely user-friendly and simple to navigate. I have had the free version for years and while it is lovely, I recently upgraded to the premium version as they were offering a sale. I purchased the premium version as a gift for a friend as well and she is loving it - my other friends I’ve introduced are hooked now too. 

The only changes I would like to see: while I love the sleep meditations (they’ve helped me ease into slumber the past several nights when I was feeling restless), I would love to see a longer one, around 10-15 minutes. Sort of an in-between of the 5 min. meditations and the longer, ~30 minute stories as sometimes I want something that falls in the middle. Lastly, they offer so many other wonderful, external resources/readings. I would love the ability to be able to save certain readings to refer back to when I need them without forgetting. Other than that, this app is perfect and I tell everyone and anyone about it - highly recommend whether you are just trying out meditation for the first time or you are a seasoned professional: there’s something for everyone.",Mia nic,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2020-07-28 17:03:49,thank you from a queer neurodivergent person,False,"it’s great to use an app made by and supportive of BIPOC, women, people with mental illnesses/nerurodivergence, and the LGBTQ+ community. it acknowledges our specific issues and gives us specific tools to cope with them. i love the sense of kindness, nonjudgement, and inclusivity it exudes, and i love that it has acknowledged BLM, covid-19, and BIPOC mental health month, and provided resources specific to these issues and the people they affect most — while also including those who are affected in a more subtle way. it gives me encouragement to be kind to myself and accept my feelings while reflecting on what i could work on in myself and my life and how i can better support others. it gives me space to be myself, in the moment. and the free version doesn’t give you everything, as is expected, but it gives you enough to be genuinely helpful. it also uses money from premium accounts to give back to organizations helping communities in need, like BIPOC and LGBTQ+ orgs. most other self care and meditation apps don’t do all these things — i’ve tried a few others and this one is my favorite. thank you everyone at shine!",LiveSpontaneous,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
3,2020-09-01 13:32:24,For Those New to Meditation,False,"I really enjoyed Shine when I first started using it about 1.5 - 2 years ago, they even gave me a reduced rate when I couldn’t pay the full cost! However, recently I haven’t been connecting to all of the app updates they’ve been making. This morning I opened the app and saw meditations sponsored by GrubHub and it just felt cheap and tasteless (no pun intended). I don’t want to use a platform that I value for my mental health to see sponsored content. If you’re new to meditation this might be a great entry point, but I find myself using Liberate or Calm more than I do Shine. Shine was my to go to and I would recommend it to friends all the time, now I just don’t get the same support I used to from it anymore. The daily check-in isn’t  what it used to be and I miss that. In my opinion, it’s become too hip trying to please it’s rise in popularity, but for folks who deal with mental health issues it can be a little challenging to adjust to when you’re looking for helpful meditation guides. If you’re BIPOC, I highly recommend Liberate app to go along with the Shine. I’m not affiliated with them, just found them to be the next level up from Shine. I’m invested in my mental health and found meditation to help me tremendously so I’m hoping I can offer some helpful tips.",A.RNTR,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
3,2020-03-22 18:44:57,Premium Cancellation Woes for a Lackluster App,False,"Like another reviewer, I decided to give Shine Premium a try. About 3 months in, I cancelled the auto-new option both through the App Store. I received an email asking to update my payment information- I logged into my account for the first time in 6 months and there was nothing on there that indicated I was a Premium member. I woke up today to find they charged me for another year of Premium. I’m frustrated because I do not like this app because I find their texts and exercises both patronizing and superficial. I’ve already reached out via email several times (no response), so I’m hoping this review will catch someone’s attention.

I feel older teenagers and women in their young 20s miiiiiiiiight benefit from this app. I really did not like their approach- it always felt patronizing and superficial to me. For example, I don’t want to be told to yell, “I AM WORTHY.” I also didn’t like how slow the narrator spoke- I often played it double speed and still would find myself rolling my eyes at the “message.” Overtime, it felt like lip-service feminism and would give me the same sensation as nails on a chalkboard do.

All in all, the app is like a cupcake: pretty to look at, but lacks real substance.",balloondogspop,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2020-01-07 03:53:30,No words can describe what this app has done for me,False,"I started using shine about a month and a half ago on the recommendation from a friend. I had tried other apps similar to Shine and assumed it would be like the rest, but I still gave it an honest effort because I was in such a deep hole at that point in my life that I was willing to reach for anything to pull me out. Within 24 hours, I bought the annual subscription and have not gone a day without a meditation or reading an article. I never realized the impact this app had made on me until I was speaking to my therapist and he asked me what it is that made me change my outlook on so many things. I realized it was the 10-15 minutes I spent being present and focusing on myself everyday that changed those feelings. I see things in a new light now and the work that the Shine team does along with collaboration from the community has changed my life and quite possibly could have saved it. Thank you to Naomi, Marah, and the rest of the Shine Squad for all that you do!",melissanicoleexo,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
3,2020-01-25 14:57:49,Good but could be better,False,"I like the app and features are improving but still needs work.  For example, The “journaling” check-in part of the app is very limited and I would like it to be more free-form (isn’t the point of journaling to allow a stream of consciousness to flow?!). Also the mediations are just ok. The articles proceeding the mediations generally have the most meat, as they are chock full of good tips and tricks. The daily focus topics are varied which is nice but sometimes I feel like it’s all over the place. Maybe weekly/monthly THEMES would be better....to build on what we are learning and/or practicing re habits, mindsets, etc.  There’s far more to do using Shine than I have time for.. I try to listen and read the daily talk in the AM, but I rarely have time for any additional listens.  The community chat is too much for me, more like a social medial rabbit hole (but way more positive).  I imagine the community chat is a good reference on topics, if ever needed.  If your curious, give the app a try. It’s good and I expect it will improve. I get something good out of, just want more.",eatlikeyougiveadamn,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2020-05-10 14:15:33,Great for motivation and anxiety,False,"I bought the Shine app through a promotion, and have enjoyed it as a mental health add on. The daily pep talks tend to be about anxiety, focus, and motivation, but they branch out to different subjects as well. They have separate meditation guides as well, but not as in depth as HeadSpace. They also include journaling, and you can “text” for help with issues, but it’s not a real person, just a way to let you write out any frustration or problem you may not want to keep bottled inside. They also have play lists of calming music (which I love when getting ready and doing makeup) and take old popular movies and recap them to help you sleep. I look forward to listening (when I remember!) as I had to turn the text reminders off as there were a lot of them. Overall, I like the app and think it is definitely a good tool for mental health, but not a replacement for real therapy.",Poverbaugh,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
4,2020-09-03 15:56:40,Most beautiful self love app,False,"I genuinely love this app. I love that I downloaded it and hadn’t touched it for over a month- but was getting daily notifications on my phone from it and every time I read one, makes my heart smile and gives me a little reminder to breathe. I love that this entire app seems to empower oneself and helps teach self love and  focus on self care. It’s easy to use, and not isn’t time consuming. One thing I think would be really nice to have on it is a section that you could access for some counseling or mentoring for some additional help. I’d definitely pay for a subscription if they had some sort of one on one communication like that.(I think that’s the only reason I didn’t give the full 5stars, if it included some sort of additional support- even if it cost something more, I would have to give it like ten stars. Aside from that, I am grateful for this app and the new support for self love and self care support. ) Thanks!",RockinRisa,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2021-03-15 17:07:33,Best meditation app EVER,False,"I can’t get over how much I love Shine. I used to use headspace but I found the meditations repetitive and I didn’t feel like they did much more than tell me to breathe. Shine has so many different kids of meditations, one of my favorites being the daily rituals that go along with activities like drinking coffee, doing makeup, commuting, doing dishes, and even waiting. And the daily shine always feels tailored to me, like they know exactly what I need to hear that day. And I love the encouragement to reflect and jot down a few notes, which I like looking back on. I just love this app so much!!! 

(If a developer is reading this, I do have two minor requests. When I finish the meditation, the quiet music continues for a moment but then stops during the reflection. Is there a way for it to keep going while I type and reflect? Two — it always seems to miscount my streak, I think that might be a bug. Love you!)",andyesse57,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2021-05-07 11:30:48,Love love love!,False,"I am a behavioral therapist and I recommend this app to all of my clients, and use it myself as often as I can. I love the meditations, I’m OBSESSED with the guided journaling, and the sleep music library has honestly been a game changer for my nighttime routine. My only suggestion for the creators is to get some content regarding frustration with one’s health and specifically loving oneself when it feels like your body or your mental health are working against you. I am disabled and could see myself making content like this for my clients because it’s difficult to find elsewhere, but I would love even more for it to be on this app so I can do them for myself (it’s more difficult to be kind to oneself than others in my experience). Overall the app is wonderful and absolutely worth the subscription fee even though I don’t use it every day. Please keep up the great work.",EdgarAlliePoe,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,2021-01-26 17:27:14,Best. App. Ever.,False,"I’ve tried many meditation apps and podcasts before, but I’ve never found something as unique as The Shine App.

The app is so intuitively created, and well written so that you truly have a self-care journey. Special mentions to the weekly intentions that they let you set, so that recommended content is shown to fit your chosen affirmation!

The Shine App also excels with it’s guided structure. Every morning they prompt you with an exceptional guided meditation, a reflection, written takeaways, recommended articles, and then 2 quick questions to note down your gratitude. It has introduced the perfect morning routine!

The meditations are extremely well edited, with high quality audio and soothing tones! I have to give a shout-out to Mel Chanté, her daily meditations are well written and amazingly delivered.

Lastly, I have to applaud the fact that the app is created by two women of color— this is well reflected in the content created. As the majority of the meditation speakers are of color! Not to mention, many meditations touch on racial healing and wellness. 

As a WOC who meditates, much of the podcasts I listen to are mostly led by white women, so it is nice to see my values and identity represented at Shine. 

Best. App. Ever.

Will continued to support as much as possible. Thank you to everyone who helped created this! ✨",scorpioofcolor,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,

I use to be able to listen to new voices and people helping me every day. I use to connect with them on social media. Tracking my mood. Listening to meditations and enjoying daily shines, sleep help, so much and I go into a slump for some months to come back to find out all I can do I pretty much check in. You have to pay to have access to more than 90% of the app now. Banking off people on a app that cost not only significanty less not even a year ago, but yeah didn't cost to track moods... Like come on. Most people can't even afford health care and you've turned Shine into one of ""THOSE"" apps. I guess I'll find an alternative to get back into shape and help me with my anxiety. Youper now offers the best help, along with ""insight timer"". Over 90k free meditations free. Smh. It's so unethical and sad what this app has changed into. So so much different.

5,2021-02-28 18:21:02,A Mind Saver,False,"This app has been a mind saver. Mental health has always been a struggle for me. I’ve had much trauma in my life, so have always read and been immersed in the practices of mindfulness and resilience. I needed something to go along with the therapy I was doing, and wasn’t finding anything that I could solely rely on. The Shine app served it all! As a POC it was refreshing to find a community here of POC’s sharing their wisdom. It’s so rare to see POC’s in this industry. Knowing that they were POC gave me an added layer of comfort and relatability which has definitely been a refreshingly different experience. I started the app on free service for a few weeks to really learn if it was for me. I’ve just subscribed to the paid today, absolutely no regrets and continue to look forward to the progress I can learn here. Thank you Shine App!",Minsi Li,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,

5,2021-06-10 00:33:21,"Amazing, some room for improvement",False,"I love the Shine app. I used to use Headspace but I’ve found this app to be more personal and helpful. Compared to Shine, headspace is sterile, un-interactive, and less diverse. The subscription is totally worth it. 
Room for improvement: the app doesn’t work well with Sign In With Apple so I had to switch to an email for a smoother experience. I’m my experience, the start-up screen flashes once or twice which isn't a big deal but makes the app feel a bit less polished. Lastly, I would love to have a dark mode. I use the app at night a lot and the white background is super bright. Overall, amazing app and I would recommend to anyone looking for mindfulness and less worries in their daily life.

1,2020-05-26 00:56:53,Take my money.... really... please???,False,"I’ve never tried to throw money at an app harder than I have today with Shine.  I decided to drop the $50 and get the annual premium subscription which the transaction happily processed... except the app’s features won’t unlock.  App Store Subscriptions reflect that I have purchased the Annual Premium Subscription, however my in-app profile still shows the Free subscription, I still have in-app messaging to purchase, and  every time I try to use a locked feature, I am again messaged to purchase... 

OK, I’ll play - maybe I need to unstick something?  So I move forward with the repurchase, and receive a message that I have already purchased.  Great!! Progress!!  So I click the option to continue only to enter into the same experience of a locked feature asking me to purchase.  👎🏽 

Round and round we go... I cancelled the subscription, repurchased, deleted the app (which recognized I had a subscription and asked me if I wanted to keep it although I was deleting the app... ding, ding, ding 🛎), reinstalled - all the standard “trying to unstick something” protocol.  

I wouldn’t be so triggered except **it’s a $50 app and I can’t unlock the Features that I just paid for**, and the app knows I have paid for them, but the UI isn’t reflecting the same.

I appreciate voices other than Caucasian North American English sounding dialects. I love anything POC/Black owned and operated. Its unfortunate the service lacks in this company.

I use this everyday to get my morning started and even turn to the app when I need to check in or listen to uplifting meditation when I need it. This app has helped me be more self aware with how I’m feeling. The daily check in’s helps me to slow down and sit with how I’m feeling and reflect on the support I can give myself.

4,2021-03-24 13:32:58,Shine Review,False,"Context: I only tried the free version, not the premium

This app uses psychological treatment for anxiety using mindfulness, the awareness of experience in the present, and acceptance and commitment therapy which uses mindfulness skills that helps to accept and deal with upsetting  thoughts or feelings, understanding values and using values to change said behavior. 
The app also gives an outlet to others to talk to which isn’t something that connects specifically to a psychological treatment but is a good way to relieve some stresses of anxiety. 
Overall, this app features many good options for someone with anxiety. Some features that I thought were great resources or options for someone who has anxiety are:

Journaling
Talking with others (that use the app)
Meditation
In the moment joys

I would give this app a 4.5 but I can’t give half stars (I’m not sure why). I think that the app could improve by adding an option to talk with a therapist or having a therapist look over group conversations (I couldn’t tell if something like this was happening or not so I was a bit concerned).",Shiloh T.,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,

4,2020-03-27 16:46:43,Great app but...,False,"I absolutely love this app and the different meditations and exercises that it offers, however, I don’t like that even with premium you can only check in once a day. It is a very therapeutic app, and check ins help a lot when people are stressed or anxiety ridden, but not if they’re a once a day thing. I feel like this makes people who have really bad anxiety feel boxed in, limited and helpless. I love being able to vent and communicate when I feel anxious or upset, and checking in is a great way to do this if you’re afraid to talk to someone about your problems, but when you limit that, it leaves very little room for personal growth and development.",Emyli Thompson,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,

I love that it gives you options if there is a section you aren’t in the mindset to complete if you aren’t able to gather your thoughts in that moment. I also like that it gives you the option to listen to a meditation, read something, type something, or speak vocally- it is inclusive of all forms of communication! You also have the option of connecting with others and seeing what they want to share on their. It is uplifting, positive, and calming.

But.

Since the format has changed, I feel scattered, I have to jump all around the app in order to get the meditation, article, and then finally the check in. The way it was—in text form—was so intuitive and had a wonderful flow. This is disjointed and it’s just really disappointing. Not only that, but since the change none of the things I have bookmarked have shown up in my favorites, so now I cannot access certain things.

There’s a great variety of meditations for just about every situation possible, and I love, love the “daily check-in” feature. It’s so amazing for starting your day on a good note (if you do it in the morning) or for reflecting on it (if you do it in the evening).

The soothing voices, the wonderful messages, the breathing. It’s all been so good. I know I’ll be sad when my year subscription runs out, but am so thankful for the time we’ve had so far.

As June brought on more public racial trauma, the app I was previously using Simple Habit left me completely disappointed. It added a section to attract Black users but offered general meditations on stress that did not relate to racial trauma or healing at all.

I love everything about it, the check-ins, the articles you can read, the choices it gives, the reflective questions it asks, and the fact that it is simple, straight forward, and easy to use and understand.  My absolute FAVORITE part about this app is that it has women of color...WOMEN OF COLOR.  I can’t tell you how valuable and important that piece is to me.

Better yet, it’s been 3 days and they still haven’t emailed me back after requesting cancellation of my account, and a second email requesting a refund! I had to get my credit card company involved to get a charge back since the lack of communication from the creators of this app lacks greatly.

After renewing Shine premium & updating the app.  I’m disappointed the menu was taken away that used to be on the left side. It was a much easier way to find articles 
especially without having to check in first, etc. Also,  seems after the updates besides the deleted side menu....something is missing🤔or am I missing something🧐?

I emailed Shine customer service and also the “vip” email they are telling others to contact on here and nothing. I spoke with a rep from Apple who looked at my banking statement and App purchase history. Somehow the subscription was through Apple but Shine has collected payment info on their own as my recent charge from them was billed directly from the Shine office. Super sketchy!
