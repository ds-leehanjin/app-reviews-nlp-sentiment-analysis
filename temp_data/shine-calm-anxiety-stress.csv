5,A MUST HAVE after 2020,"Like pretty much everyone else, I noticed my mental health had a deep decline in the fall and winter months. I already suffer from anxiety and I knew I needed to make some changes in my life, but I wasn’t sure where to start or what app might be best. I have had one other meditation app in the past and went to use it again, but I was frustrated with the pay wall so I kept searching, hoping I could find something that would also help me set intentions for what I want to get out of my practice. I was especially interested in something that would correspond between meditation and sleep, as I have been experiencing sleep problems in recent months which are completely new to me.

I am so thankful and happy to have come across Shine! The structure of the app is both easy to navigate for simple daily use, but also wonderful to explore deeper practices. I really enjoy having bios of all the speakers, as it makes me feel more connected to who I am taking time to meditate with.I literally just downloaded the app two and a half days ago, so I haven’t had as much time to explore all the features and benefits but I’m already cooked.

Speaking back to the paywall, I was even more excited to learn that this is a minority and female owned company, so I had zero hesitation in paying for premium. The cost is about the same for many other apps, so why not support the awesome women behind this fantastic app?!?!!",SillyR1015,2021-01-07 22:55:25,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,Best meditation app EVER,"I can’t get over how much I love Shine. I used to use headspace but I found the meditations repetitive and I didn’t feel like they did much more than tell me to breathe. Shine has so many different kids of meditations, one of my favorites being the daily rituals that go along with activities like drinking coffee, doing makeup, commuting, doing dishes, and even waiting. And the daily shine always feels tailored to me, like they know exactly what I need to hear that day. And I love the encouragement to reflect and jot down a few notes, which I like looking back on. I just love this app so much!!! 

(If a developer is reading this, I do have two minor requests. When I finish the meditation, the quiet music continues for a moment but then stops during the reflection. Is there a way for it to keep going while I type and reflect? Two — it always seems to miscount my streak, I think that might be a bug. Love you!)",andyesse57,2021-03-15 17:07:33,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,Love love love!,"I am a behavioral therapist and I recommend this app to all of my clients, and use it myself as often as I can. I love the meditations, I’m OBSESSED with the guided journaling, and the sleep music library has honestly been a game changer for my nighttime routine. My only suggestion for the creators is to get some content regarding frustration with one’s health and specifically loving oneself when it feels like your body or your mental health are working against you. I am disabled and could see myself making content like this for my clients because it’s difficult to find elsewhere, but I would love even more for it to be on this app so I can do them for myself (it’s more difficult to be kind to oneself than others in my experience). Overall the app is wonderful and absolutely worth the subscription fee even though I don’t use it every day. Please keep up the great work.",EdgarAlliePoe,2021-05-07 11:30:48,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,Best. App. Ever.,"I’ve tried many meditation apps and podcasts before, but I’ve never found something as unique as The Shine App.

The app is so intuitively created, and well written so that you truly have a self-care journey. Special mentions to the weekly intentions that they let you set, so that recommended content is shown to fit your chosen affirmation!

The Shine App also excels with it’s guided structure. Every morning they prompt you with an exceptional guided meditation, a reflection, written takeaways, recommended articles, and then 2 quick questions to note down your gratitude. It has introduced the perfect morning routine!

The meditations are extremely well edited, with high quality audio and soothing tones! I have to give a shout-out to Mel Chanté, her daily meditations are well written and amazingly delivered.

Lastly, I have to applaud the fact that the app is created by two women of color— this is well reflected in the content created. As the majority of the meditation speakers are of color! Not to mention, many meditations touch on racial healing and wellness. 

As a WOC who meditates, much of the podcasts I listen to are mostly led by white women, so it is nice to see my values and identity represented at Shine. 

Best. App. Ever.

Will continued to support as much as possible. Thank you to everyone who helped created this! ✨",scorpioofcolor,2021-01-26 17:27:14,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
1,SHINE,"I use to love Shine.... I used it every single day. You know, shine use to be a beautiful app that helped me so much with my anxiety and depression. I use to be able to listen to new voices and people helping me every day. I use to connect with them on social media. Tracking my mood. Listening to meditations and enjoying daily shines, sleep help, so much and I go into a slump for some months to come back to find out all I can do I pretty much check in. You have to pay to have access to more than 90% of the app now. Banking off people on a app that cost not only significanty less not even a year ago, but yeah didn't cost to track moods... Like come on. Most people can't even afford health care and you've turned Shine into one of ""THOSE"" apps. I guess I'll find an alternative to get back into shape and help me with my anxiety. Youper now offers the best help, along with ""insight timer"". Over 90k free meditations free. Smh. It's so unethical and sad what this app has changed into. So so much different. I never leave all reviews or have to delete apps I love but this will be it. :(",SammieBR93,2021-05-03 18:20:53,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,"{'id': 22633474, 'body': 'Hi there, thanks for reaching out!

5,A Mind Saver,"This app has been a mind saver. Mental health has always been a struggle for me. I’ve had much trauma in my life, so have always read and been immersed in the practices of mindfulness and resilience. I needed something to go along with the therapy I was doing, and wasn’t finding anything that I could solely rely on. The Shine app served it all! As a POC it was refreshing to find a community here of POC’s sharing their wisdom. It’s so rare to see POC’s in this industry. Knowing that they were POC gave me an added layer of comfort and relatability which has definitely been a refreshingly different experience. I started the app on free service for a few weeks to really learn if it was for me. I’ve just subscribed to the paid today, absolutely no regrets and continue to look forward to the progress I can learn here. Thank you Shine App!",Minsi Li,2021-02-28 18:21:02,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,"Amazing, some room for improvement","I love the Shine app. I used to use Headspace but I’ve found this app to be more personal and helpful. Compared to Shine, headspace is sterile, un-interactive, and less diverse. The subscription is totally worth it. 
Room for improvement: the app doesn’t work well with Sign In With Apple so I had to switch to an email for a smoother experience. I’m my experience, the start-up screen flashes once or twice which isn't a big deal but makes the app feel a bit less polished. Lastly, I would love to have a dark mode. I use the app at night a lot and the white background is super bright. Overall, amazing app and I would recommend to anyone looking for mindfulness and less worries in their daily life. This app is a great addition to my ‘toolkit’.",Liamlicious14,2021-06-10 00:33:21,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,Meditation Encouraging Self Compassion and Love,"I've really been enjoying taking little breaks here and there with the meditative sessions curated to my weekly goals and just looking through the library for what I want to work on in that particular moment: calming my anxiety, staying motivated, or taking a moment to be grateful. 

I love that there's a range of shorter to longer sessions for any occasion or mood. An improvement I'd like is for the audio to keep playing even after my screen locks. Otherwise if I fall asleep to a relaxation session, my phone will just stay in the app all night until it dies which isn't great when I use my phone for an alarm.",Jess Dreams,2021-02-05 00:42:41,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
4,"Love the app, check-in is glitchy, though","I love this app and have been using it to maintain my commitment to meditation and mental health! Unfortunately, I find that usually at night, the check-in function gets glitchy and it’s impossible to move forward and complete it—at least, it appears incomplete. The next day, however, I discover that my attempts at entering information have gone through, to the tune of four or five times. So i’ll have 4 or 5 copies of the same “my gratitude” information, for example. Since I cannot erase them after the fact, I’m  stuck with all of it. Irritating. Either fix the bug and make users able to remove what they entered.",zenma25,2021-06-21 17:42:07,True,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,"{'id': 22512047, 'body': 'Hi there, thanks for reaching out!

4,Shine Review,"Context: I only tried the free version, not the premium

This app uses psychological treatment for anxiety using mindfulness, the awareness of experience in the present, and acceptance and commitment therapy which uses mindfulness skills that helps to accept and deal with upsetting  thoughts or feelings, understanding values and using values to change said behavior. 
The app also gives an outlet to others to talk to which isn’t something that connects specifically to a psychological treatment but is a good way to relieve some stresses of anxiety. 
Overall, this app features many good options for someone with anxiety. Some features that I thought were great resources or options for someone who has anxiety are:

Journaling
Talking with others (that use the app)
Meditation
In the moment joys

I would give this app a 4.5 but I can’t give half stars (I’m not sure why). I think that the app could improve by adding an option to talk with a therapist or having a therapist look over group conversations (I couldn’t tell if something like this was happening or not so I was a bit concerned).",Shiloh T.,2021-03-24 13:32:58,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,Wonderful!,"This app is really great! It is easy to use, feels safe and welcoming. I love that it gives you options if there is a section you aren’t in the mindset to complete if you aren’t able to gather your thoughts in that moment. I also like that it gives you the option to listen to a meditation, read something, type something, or speak vocally- it is inclusive of all forms of communication! You also have the option of connecting with others and seeing what they want to share on their. It is uplifting, positive, and calming.

3,Missing the lengthy text,"I’ve been a member of shine for so long I’m at 800 check ins. I love the content and it’s finally something I have that fits me and my morning routine.

But.

Since the format has changed, I feel scattered, I have to jump all around the app in order to get the meditation, article, and then finally the check in. The way it was—in text form—was so intuitive and had a wonderful flow. This is disjointed and it’s just really disappointing. Not only that, but since the change none of the things I have bookmarked have shown up in my favorites, so now I cannot access certain things. I know I am not the only one struggling with this but I just can’t get used to it.",Itsshxpxptspycbjkkjctsajnk,2021-02-03 12:48:23,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,My Favorite Place To Be,"This app has meant so much to me. Even my 4 year old daughter loves it & asks for it every night before bed. She calls it “the calm thing”. The soothing voices, the wonderful messages, the breathing. It’s all been so good. I know I’ll be sad when my year subscription runs out, but am so thankful for the time we’ve had so far. Especially during this exceptionally bizarre time in life, pandemic, presidencies, staying distant from our friends & family... it’s nice to have a “friend” who can give you some positive words of support & reassurance.

5,LOVE + Adjustments Needed,"I love this app. It is so well designed and the content is quality. If everyone used this app, they would be happier. There are a few things I wish this app had: a longer journaling section, as to reflect more in depth , an option to view previous days and journaling to reflect on your progress and previous lessons, a way to queue meditations or articles to read for later or for the next day.

5,Great for Beginners,"I would undoubtedly recommend this app to anyone. If you have stress or anxiety, a lack of confidence or self esteem, or just want to relax your mind, this app is for you. I would recommend trying their free meditations first to make sure you like it, but paying for all the mediations is well worth it. Their SHINE method for anxiety is amazing, and doing the daily shine every morning makes my days start off so much better. Plus I genuinely feel like they are a great company with good intent and give love and support to any marginalized group.",A Non-Bearded Vegan,2021-03-23 23:06:06,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,
5,Just for me!,"It’s wild how much someone can feel seen all through a meditation app. I just started using meditation apps before I downloaded this one and now I’ve deleted the others. Having women of color from around the world being the voices for this is nothing short of amazing. On top of that the simple examples of struggles, the topics, they just relate so well to women of color. I didn’t realize their could be something like this and now I can’t go back.

Affirmations, gratitude, guided meditation, and awesome notifications that allow me to check in with myself and my goals.

3,I did not find app very helpful,"I found a lot of the content was recycled. I receive emails from shine way too often. And, while I downgraded my subscription months ago, earlier this month it had been renewed anyway. Had I not reviewed my credit card statement I would not have noticed. I’m not sure if this is because they are somewhat disconnected from the subscriptions in the App Store. I submitted a case to Apple Card. Also, I find the app glitchy.

Am I signing up for a service or have I already signed my information over to your company? I don’t like the start of this, already. Only the content YOU put out should be under YOUR paywall.

Forcing politics in to every turn, they just want to add to the overwhelming situations. Trying to put enough guilt on someone to stay with this half-baked app despite so many shortfalls. 

So many great options exist, this needs to fade away and go where apps go after their time is up. Look in to Insight Timer, Headspace, or Calm for a real meditation app, this doesn't cut it.",SingleServPepper,2021-02-01 15:27:16,False,shine-calm-anxiety-stress,1293721589,

5,Shining,This is my favorite app. I’ve tried Calm. These mediations are more in tuned with what I need on a day to day.
