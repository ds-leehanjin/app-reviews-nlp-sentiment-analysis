"Edit: After deleting and reinstalling the app, Noisli regained its functionality. I’ve also changed my rating from one to five stars. 

Since updating my iOS, the app no longer functions as others have said. I enjoyed  the app on an almost nightly basis, in order to help me fall asleep, for 5 years. I hope there’s an update soon. If there’s an update, I’ll change my rating to reflect the app’s current functionality.",StephBRogers,False,App crashes,5,2021-01-02 21:27:50,noisli,862773459
"It sure does a good job of mixing rain and thunder and has nice lights but the whole reason i got the app was so i could relax, and calm my mind, read a book, listen to a podcast etc.

But i cannot find where it allows you to DO anything…  i feel like a bait and switch victim.

Even if there is a way the rating stays at 2 stars because it’s impossible to find, but more likely doesn’t exist?

I can surf the web… while listening.. amazing… i dont need help focusing on the Internet, its the Internet-  its literally the most focused on “thing” of all time.  

So now im the opposite of relaxed.

Even my Task Manager allows background sound mixing and its a free task manager (and better than things 3 and Noisli.

The app of the day is like Noisli but with better sounds and … it allows you to play it while listening to an audiobook or podcast.

Bait and Switch.",DEMON on GOD,False,A little disappointed,2,2021-05-06 08:25:37,noisli,862773459
