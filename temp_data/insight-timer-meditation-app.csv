Best meditation app hands down!,sober mama,2020-07-30 11:19:25,"I don’t write reviews for apps. I felt compelled to do so for this one. First off, i have been trying to get into the practice of meditation for several years now. I’ve tried classes, doing it on my own, and various other apps: Calm, HeadSpace, etc. Problem with those apps is they all charge you a monthly fee after the trial period. This is the only truly free app for meditation. Once I got into it, it’s laid out so beautifully, easy to find specific meditations, and its so user friendly. I really found myself looking forward to meditating after the first couple of days. It is now a part of my morning routine and i could not imagine my life without it. They do offer courses in addition to the over 45,000 free meditations. I fell in love with one meditation guide in particular who led a Smiling Meditation which literally brought happy tears to my eyes while meditating! I found that she offered a 10-day self-confidence workshop. I wound up going ahead and purchasing the yearly membership for $65. Well worth it to me bc i don’t think I could run out of courses or premium content on this app! Could not recommend enough! If you have had other apps collecting space on your phone, do yourself a favor and delete them! Get Insight Timer!",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Almost Perfect,Braveorchid,2020-04-12 06:55:55,"I love this app and use it daily. There are so many content options it’s a bit two sided—it’s a lot to sort through. My biggest pretty please wish is that it return to saving my preference to sort my bookmarks from short to long. It used to remember the last sort setting, but for some reason it was taken away (and the bookmarks kind of buried) a couple of versions ago.

Edit: I still enjoy this app, but with each new version I’m a little disappointed. I had liked the opening screen with the map of where people were meditating, but also that it wasn’t more than that, as meditation is a private thing. A quiet connection felt much more comfortable. It feels much more commercial now—I’m constantly being advertised at with smiling headshots. I doubt that would change if I subscribed, and I’d prefer to buy rather than rent the app anyway. It’s also constantly being redesigned, making it hard to know where to find things. And the last update completely took away the ability for me to sort my bookmarked meditations from shortest to longest, which I really preferred as my default and used to be able to set it to.",5,True,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,"{'id': 3061395, 'body': ""Hi Braveorchid - We're so pleased to hear you love the app. Thanks for taking the time to  provide useful feedback.

70+ days in and still LOVE this app!,KonaHIMike,2020-10-10 04:03:55,"Update — now three years in & would prefer it stop being so commercial. Meditation is not complicated, does not require going to class for the rest of your life. Those of us who just want to use the timer function — it gets put in with constant ads in your face. It is shameful actually that an organization that says it wants to make your life better pushes you to do routines and classes that actually detract from getting from point A to point B. Oh well, if the times keep getting stuck behind commercialization, at least I’m not addicted to these classes at all, I can use alternative timers or none at all.

I still mostly use it for the great sounding sequential timers. Who wants to be blasted out of their session? Not me, and this app provides quality sounds to let me first relax, sound so I know to move into my first part, then when that time has passed, sound, so I know to move into my second (rest) part, then a nice gentle sound to let me know I can comfortably open my eyes and end my ""meditation"". Works perfect -- and is all I need to use -- I can add friends when I have extra time or browse the ""forums"" but totally not necessary to do Turning Within meditation (Kelvin Chin) -- a sort of hybrid of TM, a sort of mantra meditation. It has made a world of difference and this app helps me keep my place and incidentally tracks the days that turn to weeks and months. Very happy with this app!",1,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Unable to leave reviews for meditations,Lunabeat,2021-05-26 18:29:09,"The review button on the site is broken and users are no longer able to update old reviews that we have written or leave new ones. This problem started about 2 weeks ago. I have emailed the app about 6 times over this period, but nothing has been done to fix the problem. 

I am in the habit of listening to new meditations and then leaving reviews (which are never negative) so I know which meditations I have already listened to, which I love or merely like. I enjoy reading the reviews of others as well. So the fact that this review button is not working is a problem. 

Otherwise, I love Insight Timer. I have been using it for 3 years and 3 months and have clocked over 10k minutes of meditation. The topics are varied and interesting. I bounce around a lot to new meditations based on the topics I am working on in my life. I find some of the meditations to be incredible and in the style I enjoy and others to be just good, in my opinion, but not my style. That is why the review button is so important, so I don’t unintentionally begin a meditation that I have already listened to in the past and just found to be ok, but unmotivating to me.",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
All the features you could want and then some,Flamingjellyfish,2020-01-28 02:22:03,"I like that it's versatile enough that I can also use it when I want to do yin yoga where I hold each pose for five minutes. Over time I've been starting to use features I thought I didn't even want at first, like joining groups and listening to guided meditations. This app has everything. (And if you just want a timer that starts and ends with a gong sound, it can do that too, although it does take long enough to load that if you just want a timer you might want something simpler.) Really I'm kind of astonished that subscription-based meditation apps even exist, given how good Insight Timer is.

One minor complaint...I do wish there was a way to opt out of being shown your “streak” at the end of every meditation session. I realize many people appreciate the feature, but I would really, really like to be able to opt out of it. It’s like a little guilt-trip when I miss a day or just...meditate or do yoga without using the app. Or, when I do have a good streak going, I’m still irritated because I don’t want to be “rewarded” for using the app each time.",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Best Meditation App By a Mile,SammaSam2012,2021-01-13 16:30:48,"Insight Timer is by far the best meditation app available, I’ve tried all the top apps and nothing compares. Most of the other major meditation apps are focused on selling you hardware or a subscription - Insight Timer is free and has additional content you can pay for but it’s not built as a “money machine” the way the others are. Plus, there are legitimately excellent, experienced and trained meditation instructors like Tara Brach who post free guided meditations to get you started. My only “complaint,” if you can even call it that, is that there is now a TON of essentially worthless “woo-woo” visualization exercises and “healings” posted by an increasing number of “meditation teachers” who clearly have no training or credentials and are just using the app to build an audience for their personal brand. It didn’t used to be like that, but now it’s common to see three pieces of new-age nonsense for every one actual guided meditation. I worry a bit that beginning meditators would easily get sidetracked down an endless rabbit hole of “mind candy” and miss the core point of meditation - training the mind to be present, empty, and completely open.",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
"Wonderful app, illusory privacy “rights”",SMDOK,2021-06-05 20:49:44,"I really love this app. I’ve been using it for several years now, paid and unpaid, and it does not disappoint. I have tried other products and they do not work as well. Unlike other consumers, I do not want a social network, I want a sleep app, and this one absolutely does the trick. The problem is data collection and an utter lack of any privacy rights, including third party giveaways. I was completely prepared to renew the paid version, and then I fully read the, in my opinion, wholly illusory “Privacy Policy”. 
However, I have requested opt outs and “shine the light” under the California privacy rights laws TWICE and I have heard nothing. (I understand that this app uses Google Cloud AI; there are cookies that can stay in place for two years. This, it seems, has added to the value of the app due to automation eliminating costly pesky customer service.) Now, perhaps other people are just hunky-dory with giving literally all of their personal information out with no limits, but I’m not one of them. I’m waiting to renew until I hear something about addressing my legal California privacy rights. (I’ve read in other places that there is little customer service for this app and I believe it.)

I’ve been using Insight for YEARS!,ErikaLMoon,2021-04-28 09:33:00,"Truthfully, there is no better app for meditating whether you are just beginning your journey or have already found and are simply improving your zen. You’ve found the app you are probably looking for. The guided meditations are my favorite because my brain has a habit of wandering off to things I need/want to do later, maybe a conversation that already happened, where the person is going whose loud car just drove by... so listening to someone else guide my thoughts into focus by following my breath is EXACTLY what I never knew I needed. They have tons of instrumentals you can choose from, which I have used before and practiced yoga or just worked on something with it playing in the background. Oh my, and endless sleep sounds like will knock you ouuuuut. The actually timer within the app, I honestly probably use the least. So, if you are on the fence about if this should be the one you download because you don’t just want to delete after a few weeks or months because you didn’t get out of it what you thought... you do what you choose. ✨",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Try it. You’ll like it.,Cateink,2021-02-13 13:42:43,"I love so many things about this app. First all the meditations, playlists and live feeds are free. It’s really important to me that everyone can have free access. That being said, I upgraded to get the extra perks, but mostly to support IT, so it they can continue to offer all the free stuff. That’s the goal. One can also contribute to individuals teacher, one can support that way which starts at 1.99 (US). Drawbacks: it can be overwhelming when one first encounters it, but the daily suggestions, playlists, and live feeds introduce new teachers & meditation types, mitigating the overwhelming number of meditations. So do the search features. The other drawback, in my opinion, is it’s seems they aren’t vetting their contributors as carefully as they used to, and some teachers don’t have credentials in meditation, mindfulness, yoga...., but they consider everyone an expert. Still I highly recommend it for beginners & novices. It’s changed my life for the better, and I recommend it to my therapy clients, many of whom have started their own practices.

Have to pay to rewind,Tiigraine,2021-03-24 15:25:06,"Overall I think Insight Timer is pretty good.  There is a ton of content you can access for free.  It can be a bit to dig through to find what you like, but once you do, it’s a great resource.  However, if you’re listening to a talk and want to skip back a few seconds so you can write something down, tough luck.  There are ‘skip back’ and ‘skip forward’ buttons but if you click them you’re redirected to subscribe so you can access the ‘advanced player.’  The abundance of free content means I’ve never felt a need to shell out $60 for Member Plus status.  I’m certainly not going to for the privilege of rewinding.  Also the rating system is weighted towards good reviews.  I started listening to a 45 minute talk that turned out to be very amateurish and condescending.  I discovered that Insight Timer requires you to listen to at least half a recording before you are allowed to review.  I understand why they do this, but it seriously skews results.  No one is going to sit through 23 minutes of that talk just so they can leave a review.  With this policy in place it’s highly unlikely you’re ever going to see less than a 3.5 star average review.

This is it!,yuhfdfbged,2020-12-02 01:27:16,"This is the free guided meditation app with minimal obvious data mining that I have been looking for. I feel comfortable using the app, which is easy to understand with a pleasant and intuitive interface. There is a lot of content to discover. I appreciate the diversity of the teachers, both backgrounds and styles. I did not have to answer a bunch of personal questions to get started but that kind of filtering is optional if you want it. I did not have to make an account or set up yet another password. It is really and truly free to use long term, but it is easy to donate to your favorite teachers if you are so able and so inclined. There is a social media aspect available but it is not required. I never would have found this app based on just the name but I’m so glad I read a review somewhere and decided to try it. It is non-threatening, inclusive, feels private with my opt-outs, and is very easy to get started. It even works with my truly crummy rural internet.

Why Insight Timer is my favorite app,Moxie Carol,2020-05-16 07:26:13,"Insight Timer is wonderful. I love the variety of offerings, teachers who the reflect the cultures in our world, the many approaches, from mindfulness to music. I learned about something new to help me fall asleep, Yoga Nidra. Sometimes I just try something or someone completely new, and through that have discovered some favorite teachers and readers. I tried some other meditation apps before I found Insight Timer. This is the best meditation app in my opinion, because there’s plenty of content to explore and it’s free. I did buy the Premium membership when it was on sale, so that I could take some courses and also to support IT, their staff and teachers. I listen to a meditation every night and sometimes during the day. The coronavirus talks and meditations have been outstanding and full of variety. Not everything is to my taste or needs, but it’s all such high quality that I know I can find what I need at a given time. I recommend Insight Timer frequently. Thank you for

All You Could Ask For,Dharmamama,2020-09-17 07:40:23,"This app is wonderful! I downloaded it to help me get to sleep, and there are many meditations here (guided, nature sounds, music) that have helped immensely with that. A life-changing bonus has been starting my day, rather than with news or social media, with uplifting, positive meditations - there are even some that talk you through stretching or other gentle exercises. This has really improved my outlook, which affects my whole day in a good way, and that, of course, positively affects those around me, which, hopefully, they then share...

I appreciate that the teachers and guides receive payment for their work via the app, and additionally, the app makes it easy to donate to them. I’m not yet able to afford the paid version, but plan to make that purchase as soon as possible to do my part to support them & the developers. My previous review was very critical of the free version not offering rewind & fast-forward; I don’t even miss that now because of how many great things this app offers.",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

I’d been using it for free for years and honestly it is a good price for the fact I use it every day. The benefits are wonderful, I really love the features like the playlists and the free courses. My eight year old also uses the kids section and we do meditations together because of this app. I don’t really go for the “online community“ aspect, but that is active if you want it.

Big let down.,Jgrimsley6,2021-02-24 12:32:33,"I have been using insight timer, on and off, for a couple of years but never without difficulty getting the timer set the way I wanted. I wanted interval bells and got them but never at the intervals I had them set for. Recently I decided to contact insight timer for help with this issue and the only thing that they found appropriate was to send me two notification emails with nothing in them except the automated response that they received my email and someone would contact me, they never did that. I try to meditate, partially because of almost nonexistent self esteem. It took a lot, for me, just to ask for help and then, for all intents and purposes to get completely rejected didn’t help at all. If a company isn’t interested in helping a customer then why bother with having a customer support contact in the first place? A giant let down from another company pretending to have customer support.

This ritual lasts 25 minutes. And I love it.

I also particularly like the opportunity to participate in interest groups. My current favorite is the group led by Australian meditation teacher Stephen Proctor.

The subscription is well worth the money as it connects you to daily insight and guided course work to work on personal development and spiritual growth in a wide range of areas. I think the biggest benefit is the community.

So far it is my favorite meditation app because it gives your hundreds of meditations to choose from, a large majority for free! The fact that many meditation apps are paid is what held me back from getting into meditation in the first place.

This skeptic loves it.,The Best Food Blog Ever,2021-01-17 22:10:24,"As a recovering evangelical, I am extremely allergic to all forms of woo. But I’d had so many friends talk about how great this app is, so I finally decided to give it a try, starting with the sleep meditations. I don’t have a hard time falling asleep, generally, but I do struggle a lot with falling *back* asleep if I wake up in the middle of the night. The sleep meditations saved me. Every time I’ve used it, I go right back to sleep. I’ve started using them at bedtime, and it might be psychosomatic, but I’m definitely waking up far less now than I did before I started making the sleep meditations a regular practice. 

The regular guided meditations are really great as well. I have never been good at keeping my mind focused (which was why prayer was always hard for me, lol), and I’ve tried meditation on my own, but never really hooked into it. There are several absolute beginner’s courses which have been a great starting point for me. Looking forward to getting into it a lot more! 

Literally the only change I wish they’d make is being able to filter individual artists’ offerings. Like: I can go into the sleep meditations, sort by the longest, most popular, etc. But if I go into a specific artist’s page, there aren’t the same filters available. It’s a minor issue, and doesn’t detract from my love of this app at all.

After some googling I eventually found a playlist created by Insight Timer that highlights Teachers of Color - many of whom have become my favorite meditation teachers to practice with - but the playlist isn’t easy to find within the app interface. 

As a woman of color, I’ve found it much easier to identify and connect with meditations led by non-white teachers, and it’s unfortunate that the algorithm doesn’t easily enable new users to discover these teachers on their own.

This app is a gem at an extremely fair annual subscription. What absolutely amazes me about this app are the courses. They are super high quality with excellent instructors. All you need are  15 minutes a day and most courses are 10 days long. With the 400 + courses they offer, needless to say, I am always taking a course. I finish one and I start another, lol.

Lovely app that needs one improvement.,Antilabel13,2020-08-18 10:45:13,"Really enjoying this app and using it a lot. I use the timer for meditation, and listen to the music selections to go to sleep. The one thing I think needs to be improved on is the background music/noise for the meditation timer. Some of the ones on there are a little funky in my opinion; there is one with rainfall which is great until every few seconds there is 3 chimes or something that play, it’s a small loop and they don’t feel very natural in there. Same goes for the ocean background, would be great to just listen to waves but there is some low overtone going on thats rather distracting. 

I actually would really like to be able to access the mantras or the binaural beats from the music area of the app while running the timer, that would make this app perfect. So if they could figure out a way for the meditation timer to access the music selection to be played while timing I would give this 5 stars.",4,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Elite Meditation App,localnative319,2020-11-04 18:02:48,"I’ve tried so many other apps for meditation and as soon as I tried this one, I did away with all others. No other app has such an expansive community of teachers, which was important for me to find teachers of color that I resonate with. There’s also the option to design your own unguided meditation preset, meditation music, mindfulness talks, etc. There’s also a really good range of meditations in terms of “depth,” giving beginners the option to do basic body scans and breath work, and seasoned mindfulness practitioners the option to longer and more spiritually engaging work. I didn’t meditate consistently until I started using Insight Timer, so I’m incredibly grateful. Oh, and it’s genuinely free- not the pushy kind where you can only access 10% of features. This has encouraged me to donate to teachers and maybe try a paid course in the future. I couldn’t recommend this app more!",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Problems,Addicted to puzzle,2021-06-02 17:13:03,"Unfortunately recent updates have made the app more glitchy and less useful. I have used your out for a while.  But it seems that it's become more difficult to use the simple timer.  The need to constantly tinker with things and the inability to leave things as they are seems to be a problem with all technology. It seems that you have missed the point of what you're trying to teach. Less is more.  Just to use the timer now, which I find glitchy and sometimes pauses for no reason, it is necessary to be asked if you want to do a daily check in. Why? I want to start my meditation and first I have to answer a question.  There is something wrong there. Why complicate very simple thing?  I think the assumption is this everybody needs guidance, but please don't interrupt something that is so simple with what you think someone might need.

Today’s update made a mess,Jai-Jagdeesh,2021-05-17 06:12:14,"Folks, hi. I’m a longtime user of the app, and have seen a lot of nice improvements over the years (I haven’t loved all of them, but that’s beside the point), however, today’s update was a real bummer. I suddenly have a ton of old (deleted long ago) presets showing up, many of which have something in common with current presets, so there was a vet & delete process to go through to be able to do my practice this evening... and that was not easy because the updated user interface is *reeeeeally* jumpy. If my finger didn’t hit the center of the very small ‘delete’ button **dead** on, I’d be taken *out* of edit mode, and the preset would load up as if I’d chosen it for a practice. I had to backtrack from that jumpy accident about a dozen times to be able to fulfill the ‘delete’ mission. Not the end of the world, but also not my favorite moment of usage within this app. I hope it can be calmed down a bit (without reloading any deleted stuff). Thanks!

Love timer for meditation...,SKeeZiXS is ME!,2020-08-30 14:49:18,"Yes! The timer for meditation works very well for a meditation with “steps”—I use it when meditating with either three or six “aspects”/steps. 
However, although I recognize that folks also do a more open/Zen meditation which doesn’t need such close timing, I wonder if “folks” could choose to have the music sequences “not count” as meditations. Reason:  I am getting “credit” for using music to help me get to sleep OR “return to sleep” as I adjust to a new sometimes noisy home (during a pandemic)...

Re: I also loved the webinar “gentle yoga class” class with Carolyn Budgell. I actually felt wonderful—beyond any expectations for a remote class. Amazing calm and my body relaxed and I remained in silence in body and mind. Is Carolyn offering a series? I’ll go back and check

I signed up for other classes that were more like lectures—folks were messaging and adding contributions while the presenter/s were talking. My Insight was there was too much busyness...for me, that is! 
And I missed three workshops that I’d signed up for—a sign to me to make decisions based on current needs rather than curiosity because, I imagine that it’s disconcerting for someone to see folks leaving.

The Insight Timer free app was amazing! I loved it.  Then they launched premium and I knew it had been to good to last.  But you assured us the free part of the app would not change.  IT CHANGED!  The advertisements to UPGRADE TO PREMIUM were so obnoxious it became literally stressful to get to my meditations.  I hated it and was about to delete the application.

But I can now enjoy the free meditations without constantly being bombarded with click-bait and advertisements to upgrade to premium.

Also, the ‘courses’ are structured in the most ridiculous way. Who has EVER taken a class that only lasts 10-15 minutes?

There is some really good content on this app but I think the developers are a little egotistical about their products and methods.

It became unhealthy and was defeating the purpose of meditation.

My question is...is there a way to turn off the “consecutive day” report? If I meditate for 4 our of 7 days I’d rather not see “2 consecutive days” when I’ve meditated for many days that week.

This is the best for an adhd mind so I can get all kinds of help here with whatever I’m going through and time frames. Most important - 1 minute breathing to over an hour.

My only disappointment is that I so love this app and would have purchased it as a gift for so many friends (nurses on the front line that would have benefited as it’s really helped with trauma I’ve seen). Sadly a lot of other apps either had free or discounts for other apps that I see other people are using.

A blessing for the planet!,Calm and Serene,2020-09-03 01:46:18,"I’ve been practicing mindfulness on Insight Timer for ... 4 years now! What a wonderful community brought together via this wonderful app. The fundamental principle behind its offering a ***free*** library of tens of thousands of meditations is that the more people meditate, the more peace will arise around us. Sure, you can subscribe to access courses and other features, and it is well worthwhile. You don’t need to, though. I started out needing to find ways to sleep more deeply and rest rather that feel restless.

Help!!!!!,need resl help,2020-05-01 16:08:36,"I have used this app for a few years. Now that you updated it I no longer can understand how to use it. Very disappointed.

Just be forewarned,  on occasion you May be expected to turn yourself into your own IT person to resolve update issues. And it could happen when it is midnight and you are trying desperately to use  this APP to fall asleep. 

I really do like this APP and  am now determined to understand how to resolve all issues when the APP does not work as expected.

My first recommendation is to have a backup to aid sleeping when you cannot get this APP to work. 

I have now been able to resolve my most pressing issue, the loss of the meditations I frequently use to fall asleep.  I did this by simply updating the APP.  It should have been my first step to resolve the issue. I admit it was my BAD!!!!!  However with too many years on me it took me days to come up with this solution.

I now have only one burning issue with this APP and am patiently waiting to hear back from the developers. The issue is how can I use it his APP offline?  Sometimes my WIFI at home goes down. Or I am traveling and hotel WIFI does allow for unlimited connected time.  

I would like the developers to be more personal when responding to requests for help. I tend to get a laundry list of suggestions none of which apply to my issue.

Super Dissappinted,wmdb,2020-10-23 18:13:05,"I’ve been using this app off and on for a while now and decided to start using courses to deepen my meditation practice, particularly in regards to managing anxiety. I was really disappointed in the Day 5 program of the Learn to Meditate in 7 Days course, Exploring Emotions. I don’t need to explore where stress and anxiety live in my body—I feel it everyday. Furthermore, it is IRRESPONSIBLE for a faceless teacher to ask users to explore that emotion out of the myriad of emotions that can be used. That is for myself and a qualified medical professional to do. She goes as far to state not to think of anything traumatizing or painful, which is presumptuous at best, as she has no idea what my experience with anxiety in my life has been. This is an extremely bad look, Insight Timer. Putting that course in a beginning meditation course for anyone to access without knowledge or forewarning of what it entails does not bode well for bringing people to meditation, especially those who may need it most.",1,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

For instance, I really would like to be able to search for a keyword within a certain person’s meditations. Say I found someone who I really like, and want to find more meditations about “sleep”. Searching the persons name and the keyword doesn’t work; I tried. It comes up with other meditations that match the keyword and not the name.

Also, there’s no way to filter meditations from a person. I found one person who I wanted to listen to more, but almost all of her meditations were in a different language or far too long.

Still use the app...but don’t like all changes,otterki,2020-10-16 12:04:02,"Below is my review from several years ago when I just started using the app. I still use the app, but am frustrated by all the extra screens and added content. I used the app primarily for the timer and found the bonus of seeing other people meditating along with me, or adding journal entries or offline sessions an easy an pleasurable extra. I can still easily use the timer and, really that’s all I really need.  But I miss the easy ability to do the other things in a click. There are too many places and different screens now so I just don’t bother.

I think this app is easy to understand and use right away. I had gone to a meditation weekend retreat and worried I wouldn't be able to carry over the practice in daily life, but this app was recommended and I have used it every day to meditate.",3,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

You never have an “excuse” or can say that nothing will help, because every flavor of spiritual food is within your reach on this app. I think the reason it is so good and helpful is because how genuine the resources are.

My only negative view is that if Tom Brady’s Wife. It seemed week one of NFL she is somehow the new face of this app. I’ve not opened one of hers because for whatever reason the amount of money they have seems to be the reason she is poster childed on the front of every genre of meditation now. That kind of strips me of my natural feel. Just because she has all the money and fame in the world, doesn’t mean she deserves to be on the top of all the other amazing people in this app! 

I noticed a movement of interface as well. And it made me think of the documentary out on Netflix ‘Social Dilemma’ I myself have zero forms of social media, for whatever reason, that I wouldn’t expect... Insight Timer seems to replicate forms of social media. Which confuses me a little bit. I don’t want this source of health and wellness to transition into, or resemble any form of social media, butttt looks like that’s the direction it’s going...

Additionally, my logs are not automatically updating— I’m having to go in and manually enter my sessions. Editing playlists is more complicated as well.

Of course there are levels now which is understandable but frustrating.  Kind of like boarding a plane and knowing I am not a gold member.  But part  of my practice is not to compare so it offers opportunities to learn.

The only issue is that there is so much that it can be overwhelming - a great problem to have. I’m not sure how the developers can address this further (maybe new algorithms that more accurately suggest meditations based on your likes? Other presentation improvements?).

The only other suggestion I have is with the “timer” in Insight Timer: the idea for ambient sounds is great, but please include a selection of pure, isolated nature sounds (various kinds of rain, for instance), without music or bells or chanting, etc. If that isn’t possible, consider allowing ambient sounds from the catalog to be played at a low volume while the timer is used.",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

I use it primarily for timed meditation and love the ability to set the timer to all different lengths and the various gong and chime options to begin, end, or mark midpoints.

I also use guided meditations, usually searching among Daily meditations for one that speaks to me, and occasionally searching other guided meditation menus for the same purpose. I’ve always found something to try. My frustration with this app is that there’s no way I’ve discovered to bookmark or save a favorite guided meditation to easily find it again. I’ve tried before. In the course of that trying I “followed” a teacher thinking it might link me to a menu of that teacher’s contributions to the app. However, it didn’t. This is the reason this review is four stars rather than five.  

I’ve also taken some courses on this app, which are not free. Paying a subscription price unlocks everything on the app for a year. It’s been worth it for me this past year.

Let your monkey mind chatter all it wants about spending money on an app that creates time to be silent. Yeah, okay.

Not so productive it seems? Well, this app has been around for many years. I have had it for many years, and while I didn’t always pay for premium, the free version was always there for me when I needed it too, and it has taken care of me for a long time. I respect their offerings on the free version, and the upgrade encourages me to use it even more like a utility app, a part of my every day.

If you’re a beginner meditator or a long time yogi you’ll ALWAYS find something. Keep searching and the one you need will be there. 

You’ll be more in control of your mind and your life. Who would not want that for themselves? What’s not productive about being centered every moment? And having a full and grateful heart?

You can tell everyone - literally thousands of people each - “Thanks for meditating with me” individually if you want.

The only things I’d suggest are 
1) make the meditations count toward your milestones across all devices (my friend lost milestones across devices with the same profile) 
2) make the live sessions count toward milestones (I lost 50 consecutive days of progress because live didn’t count and I didn’t realize it), 
3) maybe add an exercise component (cardio), &
4) add a mindful dating piece for mindful singles.

I have tried a few other meditation apps and nothing compares to this one! Do you live meditation and class offerings are such a beautiful new addition. The offerings on this app are endless. I love the fact that you can make friends and send messages to other people worldwide. I mostly use the meditation timer and make sure to thank a few people for meditating with me each time.

Great Meditation Assistant,KidsHaveRights2,2020-12-09 21:05:15,"Many excellent instructors and guides for any level. Great if you prefer to meditate without instructors. Many opportunities to work and share with others, if you want. An astounding assortment of people of different levels to connect with on specific questions that you may not have wanted to post universally. And, very easy to use. 

However, many questions about the app seem like they should be directed to the creators and not the users. Not everything is as intuitive (obvious) as the FAQ appears to think. If my answers are there, they are not as easy to find using my search language.

I like Insight Timer, it is one of the better meditation apps. One of the things I do not like is the “non privacy” aspect of the app. Meditation is a sacred private thing, “Mind and body practices focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior.” I do not want a friends list, I do not want to communicate with other meditators or teachers within the app. Communicating with others makes this a social media app not a meditation app. If you must have it then have a one button to disable all aspects of social media communication. I do not want others using this app to communicate with me.

2.  In Weekly section, the week no longer starts on a Monday, but is a rolling average. I prefer the old way so I can see my time build up during the week. 

3.  In Monthly, the current month display in bar chart does not match the time spent in meditation so far for the month. Looks like a flat out bug. 

4.  In total progress section, and in others, the app no longer calculates and displays the percentage of total days (hours) with meditation during a particular time frame. Please put back the percentages (with tenth of a percent displayed in Total section) or at the very least provide a valid denominator for me to calculate my own.

Excellent app,JennyRaeS,2020-10-18 14:16:29,"Update: 
Did I just get a pop up about new live yoga right after I started my meditation timer? Yes. Yes, I did. Um, can’t the ads wait until after I’ve done my sitting practice? 

Updated review: some of the changes are good, but I think now that I've been using guided meditations more I've noticed places for improvement. First - it no longer switches to landscape view on the iPad - that's a small thing but it used to so now it's just frustrating. More importantly, to get to my bookmarked meditations, I have to go through something like 5 screens, many of them with very bright white backgrounds. In the dark morning this is very off putting. Finally, still, no download option means you have to be connected to the internet. 

I still love Insight Timer. The changes are great! One thing I would change: you can't rate a guided mediation unless you listen all the way thru. This means that 1)of course all the ratings are high bc who's going to sit thru 60 minutes of a bad mediation to rate it? and 2) there's no way to track those I've tried and didn't like. I wish there was some way to track negative ones as well as good ones.

Almost good.  Updated to Good.,Hokan__,2020-07-14 02:04:33,"My initial review liked the app but complained about two things missing.  Having had more of a chance to explore, I realize that my two missing desires are not really missing:

I said:
Turn off screen during session to save battery.

The app doesn’t do that but, unusually, the app keeps running after I push the “sleep” button.  So, it takes a tiny extra step, but that app seems to run fine in “sleep” mode and the bells sound when they should.

I said:
Allow for multiple sessions with a set break time between them.

I was thinking of zazen sessions with walking meditation between them.  Well, with the app’s “interval timer” I can do exactly that; I set a total meditation time of 1 hour 30 minutes, and set an interval timer for 40 minutes to get up from my seat and start walking, one for 49 minutes to stop waking and return to my seat, and one for 50 minutes to start the next sitting session.

It allowed me to experiment and find out how much I really enjoyed it.  It’s also helped me meditate more frequently than I have in the past even when going to classes.  I downloaded this app a couple years ago and have used it on and off when I’m stressed. It’s always been here for me and never asked for anything in return.
 I’ve been needing it more recently with the pandemic, where I found it extremely helpful and calming myself and getting a great meditation experience right here at home.
The teachers are amazing and the amount of content is spectacular. Again Thank you so much for offering this to us for free. 
 I did sign up for member plus today mostly because of my appreciation for this app and it’s generosity and compassion.  I also appreciate that half the donations generated goes towards the teachers.

BEST MEDITATION APP,Nuwdbjnw,2020-12-19 22:30:33,"This is the BEST meditation app available. I have tried all the other popular ones including headspace, calm, and simple habit - none of them compare to Insight Timer. 
The app has a ton of variety. You are bound to find meditations and teachers that you like. 
I also really like the new Circles feature because I can join groups of my choice and share meditation recommendations. I also love the new Live meditations. I have found some new teachers through this feature. 

I have been using this app for over a year now and have enjoyed all of these awesome features and meditations for FREE. I haven’t paid a penny. 
They have an option where you can donate to any teacher you like, but they don’t require you to pay anything. I really like this! 
Most other meditation apps MAKE you pay to meditate, which is ridiculous. 

Overall, I think this is the best meditation app on the market. I use it daily and it has helped my spiritual journey.

Request for feature,hatter lord,2020-06-30 02:42:11,"Love the features and especially the timer. Would love to see these features:

1. Would love to see a fractional second option while setting the repeat bells. I want to set the repeat bells to sound every 2.5 seconds but there is no option to input a half second. 

2. The minimum time for the repeat bells is set to 5 seconds. Would you please reduce it to 2 seconds? 

3. The sound for the bell starts a little after I tap on the bell/gong/bowl. This makes it impossible to use it as an actual physical bell because I have to try to tap the bowl a little ahead of when I want the bell to sound. This is a tiny feature but it would make a world of difference 

4. The tap area for the bells are tiny. I have to hit the exact image to sound the bell. I miss the bell many times if I am not actively looking where I am tapping. Please make the area around it actively part of the bell. 

Thanks again and would love a response from the developers!",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Should have done this before now,Gosh Darn!,2020-09-29 20:13:04,"Three months from today I turn 70.  I have never been a meditator.  Certainly not a daily one.  I’ve had a curiosity about it, but I think that part of my atheism is that I tend to be pretty much a skeptic.

In February of this year, I began daily meditation, using a few different apps I’d downloaded.  They were all okay.  Solidly good, perfectly fine.  But there were fewer options on one, or too new-ages (for want of a better term), or there would be some perceived lack.  Then I stumbled across Insight Timer.

This has felt like a fundamental shift in my experience of life, and I’ll attribute it to my time with many of the teachers here.  Both courses and guided meditations for me... a friend uses the app strictly for the “timer” aspect....bells, chimes, gongs...

Sleazy treatment of existing contract. Do not trust them!!,CoderAtty2020,2021-01-29 18:17:43,"Several years ago I bought a subscription from these people. Their service was very good, apparently so good, at least according to them, that it warrants a one-sided, non-negotiated increase in the existing membership fee, to $59 per year. Ok they have good stuff, but it is not worth getting screwed around with by having to repay a contract I had already bought and reasonably assumed would be grandfathered, as such contracts normally are, and should be. What they are trying to do is immoral and unethical. Does anyone think there are similar services out there that are better and, at least, that don’t try to screw their customers out of what they already paid for? Please be aware.

For years the app has worked pretty well but recently has stopped. It doesn’t track my sittings accurately making errors everyday and hasn’t shown my friends or others activity.

When I reported these failures I received an email stating a new update would address these issues. It hasn’t.

I don’t know what the problem is but suspect management is more concerned with capitalizing on the apps more complex advanced features than taking care of its basic core features.

Unless this app is repaired soon I will abandon it. It doesn’t work as well as a timer. I’ll miss my friends from this app but since this feature has stopped working using the app doesn’t provide any benefit other than practice dealing with frustration.

Honestly horrible,RiennaKay,2021-04-27 20:53:37,"I’ve been paying for insight timer membership plus for about a year now.

I just noticed... that the app never registered that I pay for a membership.

I can only listen to the free meditations. I cannot join classes or download. I constantly keep receiving ads to buy the membership, when I press it, it tells me that I am already subscribed, then I try to chose a meditation and it goes back to saying I need to buy membership. 
I literally cannot do anything that they promised I’d be getting when I pay.

I’ve emailed, called, wrote on Instagram, wrote teachers, I have no idea how to get what I'm literally paying for. I loved this app so much it helped me out of a dark time.

Adding guided meditations was a good idea but the sheer volume of content now is both visually distracting and difficult to navigate. 

The Circles feature is potentially harmful to users - especially in the case of circles that purport to be for users with mental health issues. Anyone can form or join a circle and use it for predatory purposes. The circles feature is also being exploited for self promotion by individuals offering paid services.

The interface makes it difficult to circumvent the cluttered default home screen and to leave circles.

"Fantastic app for less stress, more joy!!!",Millie Second,2020-01-04 20:48:03,"Insight Timer is by far the greatest meditation (calming music, sleep aid, life teachers, entrainment, emotional support) resource on the planet! This app is what the internet was invented for!!! There are hundreds of generous teachers who put their content out for free in IT, just to give back to the world in gratitude. I subscribe to support the content providers who don’t have that luxury, and for the extras, but you can access most of the content for free, no ads and no strings. If you use any apps for meditation, anxiety help, sleep, etc., the content you are using is probably also here. I love the amazing variety of practices presented with no judgements - yoga, science-based, health improvement, new age, hypnosis, and on and on. Meditation can improve your outlook, productivity, sleep, health and general well-being. Insight Timer has helped me increase my joy, energy, wellness, and creativity. 

Suggestions for the developer: I would like to have more options for keeping track of favorites. There is so much content, I bookmark a lot of what I listen to. I would like to categorize them, or at least have a small list of ones I want to listen to most often. When I go to the list of my courses and choose one, it goes to the screen to pick a lesson. Can there be a way to go from that screen to the course description? Also, since any course I listen to just to try it goes on my list, can I take a course off my list, or pick my favorites?

Getting worse with each update,zerotimesinfinity,2021-06-18 22:02:02,"They are moving further and further afield from the original point of this app, what was to be a solid and reliable timer for meditation.  They seem to be focused now on adding what to me are pointless social media features like the new mood tracker. It wouldn't be such a big deal except every update also introduces new bugs which make the timer harder to use and less reliable. With this latest update, all the timers I had created were placed in a random order and I had to spend about 20 minutes putting them back in order. Now, when I change a timer and save it, it is saved out of order and I have to go back and put it in the correct order again, which, because the interface is so clunky, takes about 5 extra minutes. Worst of all, now about half of my mediation sessions are logged with the incorrect time and I have to go in and manually edit the logs to record the correct time. This also has such a poor interface that it takes way more time to do this than it should, especially since I now have to do it for about half of my sessions. As an example, one of my 35 minute sessions was logged as 7 and a half hours. Another 20 minute session was logged as an hour and a half. The whole point of this app, and the reason I had been using it for so long, was to accurately keep track of my meditation time so I could look back and see how I'm doing over a period of time. If things keep going in this direction, in a couple of updates this app will become useless to me.",2,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,"{'id': 23484558, 'body': ""We are very sorry you are experiencing these issues with the new update.

Best Meditation App,GardenArtist,2020-01-04 15:08:08,"UPDATE:  As of January 1, 2020, I’m having trouble with this app, and it’s frustrating.  I woke up to discover that items I had never seen had been added to my bookmarks, and the most recently played within my bookmarks is virtually useless.  Every time I open the app, I have to use the “sort” button in bookmarks to try to find my most used meditations, but the system still doesn’t bring up all the most recently played.  Some of the meditations I use daily are at the bottom of a very long list of items (due to the addition of things I didn’t bookmark).  I spent almost an hour yesterday trying to delete items from my bookmarks.  This app’s organization setting needs some major help.  Only only item at a time can be changed, so it takes forever to organize.  I emailed your help center on January 2nd and was told the developers are aware of the situation, so apparently I’m not the only one who is experiencing the issues.  I’ve been using this app for almost four years, but I’m thinking of moving on to something that’s easier to use. You’ve gone from five stars to two because of the problems.

I've downloaded so many meditation apps, I've lost count.  I'm new to this experience and didn't think I could learn to meditate...until I found this.  I've deleted all other similar apps, and I find myself using this one several times a day.  It allows for individual work using bells or guided sessions (and there are literally thousands of them).  It shows you who is meditating with you around the world and lets you communicate with others if you choose to do so.  It tracks your progress and offers milestones for consecutive days of meditation.  You can also review the individual sessions and bookmark your favorites.  I'm no longer looking for any other meditation apps.  I've found the best one for me.  If I could change anything about this app, it would be the way to organize bookmarked meditations.  Although there are several options, I wish the app had a way to organize by putting like meditations together.  For example, align all morning sessions; put all sleep sessions in line, etc.  Allowing me to organize in this manner would make this app perfect.",2,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Excellent content & instructors once you get over the buggy software,Shiessica,2021-07-01 11:46:46,"I’ve been using the app for about a year now and the content / instructors and live events are incredible. I really enjoy the circles feature that allows you to connect and meditate with people all over. The tracking option gameifies it which helps me stay motivated. I love the platform and would have given it 5 stars except that it is so darn buggy! I have opened at least 10 different support tickets by things that should have been caught by their developers or QA team prior to releasing. I will add that I am a QA tester of apps and software for a fortune 100 company so I might be prone to notice (and less accepting of) these things (unable to enter live event, unable to send thanks for meditating with me messages, etc.). The number of development related issues experienced by me, and others I meditate with on the app is wild. Being in the field of technology I take it on myself to open these tickets since I know how to troubleshoot them to make sure it’s not a user error and to help others on the app experiencing the same. Tech support asks a lot of users who open a support ticket - screen shots, then screen recordings, then allow them to log in as you, emails from multiple people asking for the same thing ... they are all incredibly helpful, professional, and polite, and I believe doing what they’ve been instructed to do, but it’s *a lot* to ask for someone who isn’t being paid to QA their work. The content though, again, is incredible and I find a lot of value in that. Only marking it down because of how I find the user experience when I have to open a ticket to report something g that’s not working as designed.",2,True,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,"{'id': 23146532, 'body': ""Thank you for your feedback.

Amazing,helpineedaname,2021-06-27 14:46:15,"Unlike a lot of meditation apps, there’s A LOT of quality material on the app that’s free.  No free trial - then pay, there’s no pressure to subscribe to the full site.     There’s so much variety and I can’t imagine how someone wouldn’t be able to find meditations, music, talks or live events to meet their needs on the free side.    The variety and quality of material is phenomenal.    And I’m really starting to enjoy getting more into the circles (Or communities).     

I’ve tried quite a few of the other meditation apps out there and this app is just on a different level than the rest of them.   Truly in a class of its own.   

I like that we can subscribe to get enhanced features.     I also like that we have the option to donate to individual teachers as well.    I also just love the variety of material that’s available.   If I need a 10 minute meditation, I can sort and find something.    If I wanna listen to something longer, I can find that too.   It’s so easy to navigate!    

This app was a life saver for me last year during the height of the pandemic.   I recommend it to everyone I know w/o prompting.   I am not a paid spokesperson and rarely gush like this about apps I like. 

 I simply love telling people about this app because it helped me change my life for the better - and I didn’t have to spend a lot of money to make these changes and explore my spirituality more deeply.    I’ll always be grateful for the skills I’ve learned because of insight timer!     

People are wasting their time, effort and money trying to use other meditation apps.   I’m speaking as someone ‘who’s been there and done that.’     Insight timer is truly a game-changer.    Much love and gratitude.  ❤️❤️

Happy meditator for 9 years & counting!,leslie knope of pawnee,2020-03-16 14:38:11,"I started using Insight Timer back in early 2011, and I loved it back then. I’m still using it today and I still love it. I have tried other meditation apps, just out of curiosity about what else is out there, but always return to Insight Timer. It’s simply got the best of all worlds. I recommend it unreservedly. 

Timer: IT’s timer is easily configurable, from a basic bell at the end of your time to multiple bells at various intervals you select, and with or without a variety of background sounds. You can name and save your favorite timer configurations for easy access. 

Guided Meditation: From breath focus to motivation, open awareness to relaxing into sleep, body scans to visualizations (and more), there are thousands to choose from, and easy to search. View by length, type of meditation, tradition, benefit, good for beginners, and if you find a teacher you like it’s easy to see all of their offerings in one place. You can bookmark the meditations and teachers you like best so you can easily find them again. 

Music: Thousands of these as well, and also easily searchable as described above. These are my favorite: unguided music meditations in many forms, from soft piano to drums to mantras to upbeat to ambient multi-instrument to sounds of nature... and much more. Like with Guided Meditations, you can bookmark your favorite meditations and composers (teachers). 

IT also offers courses on a wide variety of topics, which I haven’t delved into, so I can’t comment on those. There are new meditations and music being uploaded every day, so you won’t run out of options or get bored. I hope you’ll give it a whirl!",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

love IT and how to improve,sunsunsf,2021-02-01 14:52:56,"first I love this app, I use meditations almost daily. it’s is my companion in a time when nearly all my other routines and comforts have disappeared! 

here are a few ways to improve. 

there should be a section of life events that you have selected for yourself, you can see “my courses“ but you can’t see your life events with a schedule 

from the iPhone app you should also be able to add them to your calendar

The sound doesn’t work when I play meditations or yoga live stream sessions on my laptop, only from my phone

Once a session is live, it should say when it started, and what the session is! If you have noted to attend a few live sessions at the same time, the app will only tell you their live, and when you click in the session is going on, but there’s no way to see the description of the app and remind yourself what you thought you might

finally and possibly most important, you should be able to set up a “watch next“ list! Sort of like a playlist, this way I can tag meditations that I come across for a later time, and explore different teachers. This would really help me understand different teachers, instead I spend a lot more time scrolling through trying to find them again 

please be encouraged this app has been my friend through Covid, through loss of job, through a second break up in this pandemic, I really appreciate everything you do! I probably will be upgrading as well, I really love how there’s so many events to accommodate yourself before upgrading, all the free events have helped me become a meditator, and feel confident enough to upgrade, which I plan to do in the next few weeks, so I can start taking some courses",4,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Unmatched library of great meditations with room to get better,Definitely not Schwa,2021-03-28 16:10:50,"I’ve used both the free version and paid version of Insight Timer for 3+ years. In terms of having access to some of the most amazing, well known, and even unknown teachers with lessons to share, I find the app to be great. I’m a casual meditator who tries to log at least 5 sessions per week, so I use the app somewhat regularly. For casual and intermediate meditators, I think this app will serve your needs. I can’t speak to advanced and expert level because, well, I’m not there and not sure what that level requires in terms of support. I have a hunch that an app is probably not part of those needs, but again, that’s not where I’m at.

I do think the app and experience could be better in a couple of ways. First, I signed up for a 12 month membership that was recently renewed. I didn’t receive an advanced notice of this renewal which was a bit frustrating, but in the world of subscription services, this seems to be common practice. I wished the team would have provided advanced notice of the renewal because had they done that, I would have chosen the free version over the paid service. Mainly, I use the guided meditations, talks, and timer, all of which are available for free. I thought the courses would be a more regular part of my experience on the app, but they haven’t been, so that’s one area I felt the customer service/marketing teams at Insight could have taken initiative and not fallen into a practice of assuming the user is aware of the renewal date. 

I’ve enjoyed the playlists that have been created by the team, but they aren’t really discoverable. This could be my lacking of knowledge on how to discover them, but even if I type in “playlist” into the search function, none of them populate in the results. I’ve found some of my favorite guided sessions on playlists, and when trying to rediscover those, have not been able to because 1) I admittedly didn’t save it 2) I remember the playlist but not the meditation name and 3) Playlists are just not visible anywhere in the experience.

All in all, it’s a great app for meditators looking for support in their journey. I would recommend this app, though I would personally say “stick with the free version”. The value of becoming a paying member just didn’t really deliver for me, but now that I’ve been renewed for another year, I’m going to try and take advantage of those “extra features” afforded to paying members while also keeping a close eye on that renewal date so I can respectfully decline and stick to the free option.

Pure Source of Good Will and some,Sasha B 🌱,2020-11-29 20:28:21,"I became aware of the existence of this app during a professional training on Mindfulness. My roommate kindly shared it with me and I am forever grateful to her. It was in February of 2015. Ever since then this app became an important part of my daily life. It is simple to navigate, trustworthy and supportive. I can follow my mentors and teachers in their latest practices and techniques. Or, I can explore something new and out of my comfort zone. Being with IT helped me to keep my practice in meditation continue to grow stronger. It is truly my daily routine and inspiration. I enjoy the genuine communal feeling that the creators of this app were able to create. It makes me feel close to my relatives abroad, as well as all the IT virtual relatives that share similar interests and motivation. The idea of live events became a prodigy. Ironically, pandemic made our IT community stronger and more resilient as you can always rely on a “just right “ practice to be available for your emotional needs during these uniquely trying times we are living right now.  

To the Team of those who keep a loving eye on this app and check its pulse with far more insight and vision that I can imagine, all my Love, Gratitude and Best Wishes. 💞Just continue to Be. 

Quick suggestion/inquiry: is it possible to create a reminder within this app for the live events? Something akin to the alarm clock on the day of the event, maybe within one hour of its start? Just a thought.

Bait & switch on subscription content,Sherylc6,2020-02-12 04:39:42,"I’ve used Insight Timer since before 2013, when it started as basically a meditation timer app (hence the name).  The great thing about it is that it offers a huge free community of content creators. 

I guess they felt the need to upgrade their content & design to compete in the growing meditation app market, so they started offering a subscription upgrade (like so many apps now, not just meditation ones). And that’s fine - the design changes last year were fantastic, although I wasn’t thrilled about paying for yet another subscription. I live on a tight budget, so it took me a few months to prioritize the $60 for an annual subscription, especially since there was still a lot of free content. 

Finally, I went for it a few months ago. But, I was in a meditation slump, and Insight Timer has never been my only source for meditation content. For the New Year, I was excited to do the Daily Insight every day for more than 5 minutes (which is the main reason I wanted to upgrade). I assumed when they added these at the same time as their paid subscription, that they were part of the deal - new Daily Insights every day. Low and behold, though, when I went in on New Year’s Day, there were no new Daily Insights. They added a tab with a year of old ones, and that’s it. I messaged customer service who simply told me they were discontinuing Daily Insights in place of “future features”. One of these apparently is a playlist feature, which is great, but I still feel a bit cheated. 

It’s not that Insight Timer doesn’t have plenty of other content, but having themed curated content is important, too, especially considering all the competition out there. I’ve never been the type to stick to one resource, and I’m always browsing new options. I’ve tried a course or two on Insight Timer since upgrading and I’m not that impressed. Insight Timer has professional creators, but it was started as a community where anyone could add content, so it’s sometimes difficult to differentiate between the types of instructors. And I am tempted to explore other options out there for my default meditation app, where I know I’ll get great content every time. Sure there are thousands of meditations, by far the most vast library out there, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best option. Especially if you’re looking for a curated experience.",3,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Paying customer denied access to account and accused of violating race hate policy.,justin 937392973737,2021-06-26 18:35:26,"I have been an Insight Timer user for 5 years and a paid customer for a 3-4 years. I use the app everyday and love love love the classes, teachers, and meditation. This is the space I come to for rest everyday and I am very grateful for the app. 

Last month I was having issues logging in and tried multiple times with password, apple Face ID, Facebook ID, and resetting the password through my email. It then prompted me to contact customer service. This took them a couple weeks to get back to me and i tried multiple mornings to access my account and allowed this to frustrate me when I was trying to meditate and start my morning ritual. Universe testing my patience I guess!

When Customer service (Vivian) did return my email, they accused me of violating their race and anti-hate speech policy inside the chat rooms and course classrooms and threatened permanent termination and told me to sign this policy (which I’m sure I already signed) and they would allow me to have access to my account again.

I replied letting them know that I don’t use the app for messaging people or chatting in rooms, so my account must have been hacked and I don’t appreciate being accused for something I don’t partake in when I’m a paying customer and if they need me to sign something to access my account I can do that but please look into my history and if someone has hacked my account.

A week or 2 later Vivian gets back to me apologizing and reinstating my account without me signing anything but still didn’t answer any of my questions as to what happened with my account. She actually implied that there were still complaints about my activity in chat rooms and classrooms.

I rewrote her explaining again that I don’t message people or use chat rooms or classrooms to communicate with other members and could she please investigate my account and find out what’s going on or if this is an internal issue.

A week later I received an email reply encouraging me to fill out a customer service review and not answering any of my question or looking into the issues with my account. I plan to fill that out shortly after this. At the time I ignored it and they allowed me to use the app for a couple more week.  

Now back to real time, yesterday I was trying to set up my mom on insight timers and wasn’t able to access my account. I went through the same process multiple times of password, Apple ID, Facebook ID, email password change with no luck and more frustration. 

So I can’t access my account again and they advised me to contact customer service so I did yesterday I’m sure I will hear back from Vivian in 7-10 business days…

Love the app when they allow me to use it, super lame customer service on so many different levels.

Data doesn’t sync across devices into Health,JRF_USA,2021-06-28 11:50:50,"UPDATE late June 2021: Since April, including update 15.14.2, sessions originating on the iPad sync properly to the iPhone Insight app BUT THEN THAT DATA DOES NOT sync into the Health app on the iPhone.

Insight Timer has actually changed my life,L Blechman,2021-05-10 13:27:33,"My husband and I have been dealing with has stage four cancer diagnosis sense March 15, 2020. It is been the most challenging year of my life and his.
On February 11, 2021 he had a very intense, 11 hour surgery after being told three times that he was not a surgical candidate. 
He had a very advanced signet ring cell carcinoma that had spread throughout his abdomen. 
I begged him not to do the surgery, his cancer is considered the “mother” and that her job was to spread and make millions of “babies”, those babies are stem cells that are undetectable by science or healthy cells. The job of the “babies” is to attack when mother is threatened. Mother is threatened when she is removed surgically. It is an in curable cancer.
My husband will not listen to me, instead, he listened to his sister and brother. 
He has not only still in the hospital, primarily and ICU, he hasn’t eaten since February 22 and I have been living in the hotel six hours away from home. He also had to be taken by helicopter to their big hospital in another state. 
During the surgery they removed half of his large intestine, all but 4 feet of his small intestine and now has a stoma, they removed his gallbladder and spleen, the entire lining of his stomach and it was caked onto his stomach so half of his stomach is gone too.
When the oncology surgeons from Sloan and MD Anderson told him that if he attempted to do this surgery, his life will never be the same. They were not lying. 
He now has so many holes in his small intestine that he couldn’t eat if he wanted to. He has been septic and just got another infection and when this clears up he will be transferred to an ICU type facility aka an LTACH. 
His big surgery has now turned into 3 and currently has tubes coming out of his abdomen to drain all the fluids, pus and output from his ostomy. 
He finally knows what my name is but the oncologists were right, he’s never been the same. 
Insight timer has been the one single thing that has kept me spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally able to get up each day and do what I have to do as a wife and sit my husband side 7 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Sadly, his cancer load was SO high, the stem cells are already coming and it is only a matter of time but this man is a fighter!! He won’t stop moving forward and I think our long haul will continue but at least we’ll be closer to home so friends and family can come visit.

"It’s the best meditation app currently available, recommended to me by my therapist",ktronelemenopeq,2021-05-05 06:59:32,"I think it’s only a short matter of time before insight time reaches an optimal level of user friendliness and overall organization/simplicity. It’s so close to being at its best, and while it can be difficult to traverse at times, I get so much out of it and its VAST library of all kinds of different types of meditation/mindfulness practices that I have to give it a 5, but it’s more like 4.5... When family sharing on the iOS app is possible, along with what I listed above, it will be perfect. This app was recommended to me by my therapist and my nutritionist, both of whom emphasized how much MORE content was available on this app, as well as how much MORE helpful content it has than comparable apps (I switched over from the calm app). There’s no comparison in quality, and the vastness of different levels and types of content available on insight timer, as well as the capabilities to connect with friends or make your own meditation circles, join all kinds of live classes that are available at all different times, the journaling capability is super helpful, and the app keeps your activity logged in a small variety of ways. You can personalize your privacy and just about everything else on the app. Favorites, personalized playlists, and many more options available to make using this app genuinely helpful for anyone who is interested in personal growth and progression. The superiority over other meditation apps like Calm is immediately obvious upon switching, and the cost to get the premium membership ($59.99/year) is close to the same price as Calm but you get SOOOO much more. I view this price as an investment in myself. I definitely think it’s worth it.

Everyone should have this app,888K888,2021-03-01 12:25:33,"2021.03.01 review: The app keeps getting better and better, like love meditation and yoga.  So I’ve joined “member plus” and enjoy the extra features and functionality — especially the courses, ability to download and rewind, and the fact that 50% of subscription supports the teachers.  Thank you Insight Timer!

Note — a couple of minor glitches to resolve: (1) notifications come in three minutes after the actual start time; (2) sometimes I’m listed as “Anonymous” (instead of my screen name) during a group or live meditation.

2017 review:
This is an update of my previous (early 2017) review for this app - still very positive, while adjusting for the features in the new version released in late 2017:

There is such a wonderful variety of meditations that everyone will find something here.   I like the area called ""popular"" for finding new things like guided meditations for morning, yoga, sleep, metta, etc.  There are ""motivational talks"" too, which I don't usually think of as meditation, but certainly could be helpful for many.  

I also enjoy the curated series ""365 days playlist"" where there is a theme and intro for each week, and then an individual meditation for each day. It is a nice way to learn about different meditation practices and find new things.  Most are 10-15 minutes but a few run longer.   Varies by the day.  

The ""in app purchases"" of extra timer bells and ambient sounds like birds, and flowing water round out the experience nicely.  I like that I can use those timer bells offline.
   
For people with long stretches and/or uneven wifi/data availability you can also pay a small monthly fee that enables you to download the meditations to your device.

To prevent battery drain at night after a sleep meditation, make sure you select sleep mode within that meditation.  (You have to do that on each of your devices because this feature doesn't seem to sync across devices.)  And of course, on Apple devices  you can also turn off location services and background app refresh, and swipe off the timer when not in use to preserve battery life any time.   

The ""social"" features of the app are unobtrusive and adaptable to individual preferences through privacy settings.  At the minimum, seeing the numbers of people around the world meditating at once brings hope and encouragement.  While most of the meditations are in English, many are in other languages (you can filter for this) which makes it very global.

Overall the app is very intuitive. The few times I had questions, the support folks were very prompt and helpful.   I reviewed an earlier version of the app and included a wishlist - and I can tell how attentive and dedicated the developers for this app are because every single one of the suggestions was answered in the new version.

Thank you, Insight timer!",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
PastLove,yamswire,2021-03-01 14:03:02,I’ve had this app since before they turned into a yoga/mindfulness app. Ok but they belittled what was intentionally a nice meditation timer with all tibetan bells and others. Although i paid for one year subscription. i am not happy that there is no contact information That all the icons for setting a time are so tiny it’s ridiculous. i used like when right when my meditation finished it would straight to journal pad where i would write notes And if you want to just use it for meditation only without the cast of characters and film they offer it’s really hard to at the beginning to find your way to go solo. The being.able to get any support for issues is the worst especially when you’re a paid subscriber.,2,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Your best bet for a better life. 💫,Chillbizzee,2021-02-23 23:19:54,"This is the original, the genuine and the broadest. This is the only app I can think of that could save or greatly improve your life. 30 years ago I took a course in Transcendental Meditation, it never stuck. I downloaded IT 2 yrs. ago and before long committed daily for life. I don’t commit to much, so that alone was a breakthrough. 

I know some others apps have attracted big VC money and IPO riches but I have not tried, for researched well and I appreciate this is essentially a non-profit where most proceeds go to contributors. 

It’s had some nice improvements and format changes recently such as to its SLEEP section. It has not made some obvious improvements I sent them. Such as they misuse the word FINNISH at least as American English speakers use it. Bless their hearts but they are either trying to avoid the word END and any perceived negativity or the cynic might guess they mislead to increase their metrics? I continue to mistakenly read it as RESUME. 

In the end I have trust for IT and everyone in the community. There are only beautiful people here seeking better lives and relationships. Give yourself the gift of this app, give it some time and you will come to realize why you are so deserving of this gift and so much more. 🙏🏻

2/2021 Update
IT recently came out with ‘Live’, this is teachers giving their wisdom, running yoga classes, making music, answering questions and leading meditations. The users have an opportunity to say “Hello” and comment which gives a lovely sense of community.

Now you have to toggle filters and cross your fingers and hope you can find what you’re looking for amongst 70k meditations. Incredibly disappointing. It was much easier to find what I wanted before.

The cost for the paid version is $59.99/year which is comparable to many other apps. I haven’t upgraded yet but if/when I do, I’ll update my review. 
You also have the option to donate directly to teachers you like and want to support which is pretty cool.

Every time I make a donation to a teacher, the app starts having glitches such as not responding, not displaying content, and blocking me from making any other donations after the first one.  I have deleted and restored the app at least 3 times in the last month.  It takes a great deal of time for all my information to load back into the app, and during that time I cannot take advantage of all the resources on the app.  I think the app has grown too complicated and unwieldy.

NO SUPPORT :-(,Elisa Painter,2020-12-20 13:19:38,"A year & a half ago, I gave the app rave reviews. But since the recent June 2019 update, I am far less pleased. As of the update, my Stats backtracked to lose about 40 days or more ‘work,’ & conflicting stats show between Profile pages. I contacted their Support line for help over a week ago. No response. This is the 2nd time I spent time outlining an issue using the Help feature with ZERO response. The 1st time, about 8 mos ago, was on a Courses question; & I won’t take the courses without the missing piece of info. And seeing stats build is very motivational, but that feature is useless if unreliable & not fixable. As well, not so crazy about the new format. The added features are ok, but having 2  profile pgs is confusing (especially in my case where they conflict). And I lost a lot of meds from Last Played which is how I access my MOST played. Seems as if it no longer stores as many? Finally, I miss the simplicity & directness of the old format. :-(

UPDATE 12/19/20
Just try and reach Help/Support. I dare you. Still love the meditations and ability to build playlists, which gains it the 2 stars; but good luck getting Help/Support if you’re not Members Plus. I just spent an hour simply trying to edit/update my location after a move -which I thought would take about 30 secs - as well as tried to reach Help/Support when the update just would not save. My assumption is (since before you can reach “Support” it specifically REQUIRES you to answer the question) if you are NOT a Plus Member, you do not get Support. Your request is ignored. Nice. I base this assumption, too, on the fact that this is the fourth or fifth time I have contacted their “Help/Support” and I have NEVER received a response from them.  As a retiree, I simply can’t afford to add the membership expense to my already straightened budget. To be totally ignored when asking for help smacks of discrimination.

Long Time User Perspective,jen!ya,2020-11-10 16:11:20,"TL; DR: Excellent if you just need a free timer. There are far better, less buggy, better supported paid subscription apps like 10% Happier, Calm, or Headspace out there if you want more. 

I have been using Insight Timer since 2010. It has gone through many incarnations in that time. Some time ago, it was taken over by new owners. For a time, they were engaged, transparent, and community based. But over the last few years, this has changed. 

Over time, the developers have become more distant and eventually stopped engaging at all with the community. They discontinued the tech support forum, saying it was “too negative.” Um, it’s tech support. 

As a result, there have been several bugs and tech issues that go unresolved, esp on Android. In one case, users lost copy and paste functionality for weeks. 

Recently, they began advertising a “new” service called Circles, touting it as improved functionality. In actual fact, they are killing off the rich, vital forums (Groups) and replacing them with a FB Messenger type functionality. This is not an improvement. It is a mercenary, bottom line focused move to decrease maintanance and provide an easier way to get people to promote their app for them. 

I am sadly disappointed in the direction of the developers of this app, who are now embracing the Facebook philosophy of “if it’s free, you are the product.” I will respond appropriately.",2,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

I hadn’t heard of it, but I was excited to join up, being a healer and guide for astral meditations, and putting on live events is something I’ve been called to do.

Upon joining up, downloading the app, it became clear that something was off. 

The instructions for going live aren’t valid. On both my iPhone and desktop. On the app there’s no teacher controls, and on the desktop there isn’t a live event tab, making it impossible to go live. 

It is 10.21.2020, I sent my first request for help on 10.13, and have yet to receive any response other than the automated one I got right after sending my request for help. 

I sent another one on 10.17, thinking that maybe the first request got lost and to try again, only to have the same thing happen. 

Still no response other than “we’ll get back to you shortly”. 

8 days and counting isn’t shortly by anyone’s standards.

the BEST meditation app there is,steph_taylor_,2020-08-24 18:39:42,"nuff said. but i’ll say more.... this app offers a huge variety of guided meditations for beginners and advanced meditators alike. it spans mindfulness, breathwork, shamanic drumming, anxiety reduction, and so so much more, on top of the option to set a timer with music or no music. anyone can benefit from the free version of this app, but i highly recommend investing in an annual subscription because it takes a great thing and makes it even better and more worthwhile.
i love listening to a guided meditation to get in the zone, then letting myself sit in silence as long after as feels right, and really appreciate that it 1. continues the timer and 2. doesn’t auto-play another suggested video after (as i’ve experienced too many times on youtube). i like to find teachers i respect and follow, then see what playlists they’ve curated to add to my own playlists and bookmarks.

"Life Changing, Soul Saving, Best Addiction!",LunacyGraphicDesigns,2020-06-07 18:25:13,"I absolutely love this app and use it everyday!! 
I suffer from episodes of depression, severe PTSD, anxiety, ADHD, and excruciating pain due to Radial Nerve Palsy that was caused from an officer using extreme excessive and unnecessary force against me. I am still currently being tested for the damage done and what else is going on because there are other symptoms causing pain and the doctors aren’t sure yet but they can’t rule out fibromyalgia or possibly even MS. 
Dealing with this alone is extremely difficult for me right now as well as my haunting past trauma and 8 concussions, 2 of them also being TBIs. And I’m only 29...
I’m sharing my story here for anyone who is going through their own struggles or struggling their own demons - for anyone with mental illnesses, emotional, physical, or sexual assault, any type of addiction, self esteem issues, or if you simply love meditation then THIS IS BEST APP for you! 
I purchased the full version only because I want to do the courses (& I like the dark theme. Lol). It is a bit expensive but if you aren’t interested in the courses than the free version gives you access to ALL of the 40.000+ meditations - which BTW there are HUNDREDS of different types of practices; guided meditations, yoga, music, binaural beats, hypnotherapy, subliminal, affirmations, Buddhist, Tibetan,  Christian practices, Law of Attraction, they even have ones for children! That’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this app. There’s also a community and groups where you can connect with people who also use this app near you or across the globe! You can even message the instructors or teachers directly from the app! They love hearing your feedback, so I highly recommend rating and reviewing every session you do. Plus these are certified, real teachers, instructors, therapists, scientists, shamans, etc. who genuinely care about humanity and our wellbeing. They donate their time and these sessions for everyone to access for FREE! There are buttons on their individual profiles where you are able to donate to them but it is not required. Also you can find their professional websites for more information about them and their practices. And every single day there are dozens of new sessions, talks, music, and courses added! 
This app has everything you’re looking for in it - even if you don’t know what you’re looking for, like me when I stumbled across it. It has truly saved my life and changed my attitude AND go on forever about this app, (I even got my old school punk rock boyfriend addicted to this app to help with his drinking, temper, anxiety and insomnia.)

Love it - but,Emryldeyes,2020-05-01 12:21:42,"Update 5/1/2020:
My original rating is below. Unfortunately it seems that with each update the developers make this app less enjoyable to use. My suggestion below still stands but at this point I wish they’d bring back filtering by length of time. I can’t believe someone not only suggested getting rid of that feature but that it was approved! That is literally the main way I found which of my bookmarks I’d use when I wanted to meditate. Important enough to me to drop my rating from 5 to 3 stars. I try to keep low expectations when I’m using a free app, but this is something I can’t just overlook. 

Bring back the short-long and long-short filter!!

********************************************** 

Best app out there for meditation. The content is amazing, I use this app regularly and recommend it frequently to others. 

The biggest improvement they could make though would be a more convenient way to access and organize your saved bookmarks. It would be helpful to have my own folders to more easily find what I'm looking for.",3,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Absolutely wonderful,TimDurkin,2020-03-08 12:35:28,"The best meditation app I have found...by far.  Much better than the way more expensive apps that I won’t name. 
There are tens of thousands of meditations to choose from and for all kinds of situations.
Personally, I shy away from the ones that are too “airy fairy” yet can always find something more grounded.  Not judging anyone that does prefer those just not my style.
My suggestion would be start with the free version and if the app works for you go to the paid version which is incredibly inexpensive, especially compared to the other more famous meditation apps.
I’m still in the free section and I always find a great session.

Seems to have potential but...,JC322,2020-03-01 21:17:58,"The app is not bad thus far, and I could see changing my rating pending some improvements, but...

I’m considering trying out your subscription service, however the only option appears to be the yearly 59.99 price and duration. The description within the App Store indicates that a 9.99/month option is available, however this option does not appear in the constant in app prompting for subscription. Is there not a monthly option available? Also, are the courses downloaded during the subscription period available after a subscription has been cancelled/expired? 

I would note that imo not offering a course by course purchase option is a mistake. While it does indicate that purchases might be made for some course via your website, your service is likely losing a great deal of support from those who wish to purchase courses conveniently but do not want to be yoked beneath yet another monthly subscription policy, certainly not a yearly one. 

With the ease of ‘tap and pay’ purchases so prevalent in our era, making it easy for people accidentally sign up for a yearly plan by making monthly and/or course by course purchasing either obscured or unavailable seems nothing less than extortive to those seeking to better themselves through meditation.",3,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Fantastic!,Jam rocking,2020-02-27 04:43:18,"I had a subscription with headspace and it was a great meditation app.  However, insight timer has an amazing variety and the content pretty amazing.  I like that you can set your own timer and even utilize singing bowls and nature background for settings.  I honestly am interested in a subscription, but I would only want to pay a lifetime fee instead of the 59.99/year.  I think if Insight timer had a lifetime option, say for 300 or 400 dollars I would be more willing to invest.    Either way, this is one of the best meditation apps out there and I would recommend it for anyone.  Thank you for this amazing platform.",5,False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Love it!,DDarlingDD,2020-01-04 05:52:28,"This is a great app. I use it daily. The new update would be better if it would allow my phone to go into sleep mode like the old version did. I use it for the sleep meditations, usually falling asleep. It’s disconcerting to awaken a few hours later with the phone shining brightly. It disturbs my sleep which is counter productive for a sleep meditation. I wish you could fix that. That’s really my only complaint but I am curious why the end screen of a meditation says for example  “47 consecutive days” but my home page says 364 consecutive days. Not a big deal but shouldn’t it be the same? And I don’t understand the add time feature. I love this app and the variety of meditations available. Sometimes less is more. Don’t make it too fancy or complicated.

01/03/2020 Update: i think the developers screwed it up with the latest update. Now to find more frequently played meditations one  have to go through all bookmarks which is a pain  and quite inconvenient. I guess I need to delete bookmarks but that seems like a shame.
