"I‚Äôm mostly doing a review to ask more different levels of the paid version. I don‚Äôt want/need every thing in the fancy version, there are just some sound options I wish I could have. I‚Äôd be willing to pay (reasonably) a 1 time fee to get the extra sounds. But right now the only option is a 1 yr subscription that includes a bunch of things I don‚Äôt need. Others may, and may they enjoy the option. However, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if there weren‚Äôt others who would be willing to pay a smaller 1x fee for a partial upgrade rather than the $60 for everything that only covers 1 yr. Also, would love more low pitched sound options. I rather like the brain scan sound that‚Äôs on 1 of your other apps.  Positives: really like the flexibility in this app, particularly the timer. Works great as a. Reverse alarm clock.",2021-03-06 06:04:42,Really useful but....,zatitag,3,False,relax-meditation-guided-mind,367506176
"Been using this app for a long time, I like the music and there's very good recordings of nature sounds which helps me fall asleep. I just wish the music didn't loop so soon, would have liked the songs to be at least 5-10 minutes long. Also, I would have liked to see more frequent updates with new music and sounds but it seems like they discontinued support for it.",2021-03-07 07:47:13,Great app!,Jeff Pham,5,False,relax-meditation-guided-mind,367506176
I love that I can customize my meditation modes. Thought I had purchased the lifetime years back but can‚Äôt restore my purchase. It‚Äôs worth it though being able to customize each mediation to the sounds needed to sleep better or put you into a receiving mode focus.,2021-01-20 03:46:06,Great meditation mode,swtdrgrl,5,False,relax-meditation-guided-mind,367506176
"I have loved this app for several years, having used it strictly for the white noise function. Now I can‚Äôt access some of the sounds, such as brown noise and pink noise. App says it‚Äôs trying to download them. Never does. 

I‚Äôm pretty confident the developers can help, so I‚Äôm putting this out there. Thanks for your time!
