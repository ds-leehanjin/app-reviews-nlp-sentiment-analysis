4,"Love this app but, …","I love this app very much. I really like all the tools it has to improve mood. The primary reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five stars Hass to do with the accessibility with voiceover. Voiceover is an accessibility service that changes how the device works to help blind and visually impaired people like me use the touchscreen. In order for voiceover to work well, the app and the interface Hass to be programmed right. Don't get me wrong, because I do think this is one of the most accessible apps for mood out there, but it is lacking a couple of things with voiceover accessibility. For example, when I try to customize the days for a reminder, voiceover does not give me any indication of which days are checked off. For the days that are checked off for the reminders, why not have voiceover say something like M selected or M checked? That would give blind and visually impaired users an indication that Monday is checked off. Otherwise, everything else about this app is great. If it wasn't for the voiceover accessibility problem, then I would give this five stars.",KNE06482,2021-01-03 20:28:01,False,"{'id': 20562233, 'body': ""Thank you for taking the time to provide this feedback.

5,App has helped me out a lot 💪,"The app is pretty awesome to be honest. I never thought I’d be keeping track of my moods through an app but here I am…. And it’s definitely helped me with keeping track of my moods and other daily goals I set. The CBT part of the app is probably my favorite though. Anytime I have distorted thinking, I’ll go in the app and write out why I was feeling the way I was, or at least try to figure out why I was feeling like I was and try to work through it so I can try to rewire the way my brain acts I’m certain situations. I have adhd, bi-polar disorder as well as a couple other disorders and this app has definitely helped in keeping me somewhat sane….

4,Amazing!,"I truly love this app. I've been using it since around September 2020, and I am starting to schedule it back into my routine again. It helps me to develop a schedule around understanding my emotions and anchoring me during rough parts of the day. 

The only thing that I wish was better was how long the loading time is when I update an activity. Navigating the app is a difficult because the page-loading-time is slow, even when connected to stable WiFi. This is something that needs to be improved upon, especially when you have a subscription. However, it is a wonderful resource despite app navigation.",26454!,2021-03-01 02:04:45,False,"{'id': 22201095, 'body': 'Thank you for the review. We have worked to improve the performance.

5,Free Yet Complete,"I have been testing several free emotion trackers as a therapist to recommend to my clients and this one is my favorite. It’s not super fancy or cute like some of the others, but it is incredibly easy and straightforward, and has several helpful (and research based) tips and skills for different moods and such. It does a lot more than track mood, but food, exercise, gratitude, etc. The designers did a great job.",Hne913,2021-02-12 00:08:21,False,"{'id': 21119944, 'body': 'Thank you for the review and for recommending Moodfit to your clients!
