5,"I downloaded this app right after i had a panic attack and a friend told me about it. so far it’s helped a lot when i have my panic attacks . when my panic attacks start or i feel as if i’m going to have one i hit the rootr button and it gives me two options , help me feel okay and let’s do this which are very helpful because if i just need a little bit of assistance with my panic attack i can hit the let’s do this button then it still gives you help and walks you through a little bit but it is a lot faster then if you hit the “help me feel okay “ button it says a lot of different things that help make you feel okay. and you can even tap the screen to have them read aloud to you. and it keeps going and asks you if you feel the panic had ended and if you hit the no button then it keeps going through things but if you hit the yes button then it’s over with . overall i gave rootd a 5/5 stars because of how helpful it is .","{'id': 23557384, 'body': 'We are so so happy Rootd has been helpful.

5,"I have never written a review for any app before, but I had to for this one if it means possibly helping someone. I have tried many anxiety relief apps that I ultimately end up deleting because they simply aren’t effective. They always seem so limited and robotic, and this is a breath of fresh air from that. It makes me feel supported, like I’m not going through this alone. There are two options for when you need help, which adjusts to your mood, depending if you want to be comforted or if you feel like fighting your anxiety that day. There are features that make this journal seem more honest and real, instead of just going through the motions. Honestly, thank you for this. If you deal with anxiety on a daily basis or get attacks, I urge you to get this app. You might find it more helpful than you expect. Wish you all the best 🤍","{'id': 23027267, 'body': 'Thank you so much for taking the time to write your first app review.

5,"This app makes me feel like I’m not as alone as I normally would feel. I am a 14 year old girl who is struggling with depression, body imagine and most of all anxiety and panic attacks. They are very scary and make me feel like I’m stuck in a dream and can’t get out. I have a ton of medication but I thing seems to work, this app helps a lot! Knowing that I’m not the only one who feels this way and I’m not alone, I never thought life could get this hard especially so early on but it can and it did 😢 this app helps me breathe and focus.

5,"I am really grateful for this app! I have started having panic attacks recently and was very confused and worried about my health. I have done a few medical exams, but did not find any serious issues. However, every time i am starting to feel anxious, i keep on thinking that something is wrong with me and wind up having a panic attack feeling like i am suffocating and losing ground. Reading the Rootd explanation of how panic attacks work really helped me calm down and prevented an onset of another attack. Just by having an app on my phone i am already feeling more confident that i can deal with a panic attack (which hopefully won’t occur at a level it has before simply due to the knowledge of having Rootd support).

4,"i really like this app. i mean REALLY like this app. i wish we could give half stars because it would be a 4.5 star rating. the only thing that keeps me giving a 5 star rating is that the education or techniques are seemingly limited and don’t renew themselves. 

i tried the premium version on a week trial base. i even found myself wishing for more techniques and education to be available because i had gone through a great deal of it. i couldn’t help but wonder whether i would eventually get bored with this app and forget that it existed or move onto to something else that seemed to better meet my need for a little more variety and choices. 

that aside, i do enjoy this app and find it helpful and the graphics are adorable. great job rootd.","{'id': 21997097, 'body': 'Thank you very much for your review.

5,"Aa I assume whoever is reading this is doing right now, I downloaded Rootd (along with several several other anxiety relief apps) in the midst of a panic attack and I'm really glad I did. I had been going to therapy but it wasn't really helping me understand how to deal with panic attacks when they're actually happening, and I would often just cry it out. Thankfully, this made my attacks much shorter, it's so user friendly and I really appreciate the affirmations it comes with in the SOS feature... while most apps just have a breathing graphic, I feel like I personally need affirmations during attacks and this is perfect for that.","{'id': 22204828, 'body': 'Thank you so much for your feedback.

5,"I’ve been dealing with and learning about anxiety my whole life, and Rootd is one of the first apps that truly helps. Unlike the ones in general meditation apps, its “panic button” concentrates on the feelings of severe anxiety only some people face. The fact that the watch app speaks aloud instead of requiring headphones is a godsend. I do wish there was volume control, but I don’t think that’s a fault on the developer’s end. One thing I would say would push this over would be being able to select a number of “motivation notifications” throughout the day. I’m saving up for the lifetime version.","{'id': 23267992, 'body': 'Thank you so much for your lovely review. Really like your idea for motivating notifications too!

The only paid lesson content is the short and long term lessons, and they are for when you’re ready to use Rootd to manage panic attacks and anxiety for the long term. Creating and maintaining an app is quite expensive and the proceeds help us make sure the app continues to be great! \n2) when we say panic attacks don’t last 24/7, we mean a single panic attack cannot last 24/7.

4,"I can only speak on my experiences, so I love this app! The content of this app, it has helped me through a very stressful and anxious week. For some reason this week alone I’ve had daily panic attacks, but this app has helped tremendously with relief. I love the factual information they send you with the panic button. I can’t recall what I already know when I’m in a panic state; I lose all sense of reasoning and fact finding, so reading the information in this app helps a lot with returning to a coherent calm state, and reminding me of what I already know about panic attacks. 

My favorite part is Rootd’s push to help you overcome and understand your anxiety issues from a root cause level, rather than just a quick fix. When on the purchased version they provide tools to help you investigate and resolve your root issues. This helped me identify several causes of my panic attacks from this week, and I see some long term patterns that have been toxic in my life. I am starting to build confidence and feel in control again! 

So now the reason for 4 stars instead of 5:

I ran into a snag with the purchase. I bought this on my laptop, and the directions said to open up the app on my mobile and restore purchase. It didn’t work. I tried multiple times across multiple days. After three days of no success I contacted support through the website contact form. No response, ever. I finally found the email to contact the company directly through my emailed receipt. Once I got in touch, they validated my purchase and unlocked the premium content on my account. Phew! 
BTW, they are very friendly and helpful, they just need to fix their website. Thanks Rootd!!!","{'id': 21079378, 'body': ""Hi there Yermel,\n\nWe're so happy you found Rootd!
