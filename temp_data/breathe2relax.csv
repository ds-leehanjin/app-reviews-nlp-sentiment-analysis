3,Never Connects to Apple Watch,"This is a great app that needs to be updated. I open the app on my series 4 Apple Watch and it always tells me phone not reachable and never says anything else, even while the phone is in my hands searching for the heart rate. So it becomes a bit frustrating with each use but the breathing section works very well to easily change the times for inhaling and exhaling. I would give five stars when the app actually works with my watch.",False,2021-05-11 17:30:43,trw234,breathe2relax,425720246
5,This app really works to relax you,"The proven science is that slowing your breathing relaxes you.  That’s all that’s needed to calm yourself.  Inhale and exhale when the app says to, and you will get a very nice meditative feeling.   Be sure to set the number of seconds for the inhale and the exhale; these will vary from person to person.",False,2021-01-18 12:16:41,Mr A Magoo,breathe2relax,425720246
