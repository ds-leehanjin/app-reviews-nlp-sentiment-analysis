I had one this morning, somewhere along the lines of \"what are you then, a mere body? a ration being.\" And I'm staring at my screen like how do I even answer this if I don't understand the question? There's other ones that are similar and because I don't understand what it's asking me to write, sometimes I'll just put \"lol\" so I can move to the next page. Then when you're done with your questions it will ask if you feel better and mostly my answer has been no because the questions it gave me were weird. You can pick what questions you'd like to be asked everyday but none of them really jump out to me as something I'd want to answer daily besides the one sentence summary of your day but even that is whatever. I do like that it tracks your mood, would be cool to have another tracker for what is causing your mood instead of the sad to happy face scale. The quotes are cool too. I've been using the app for about 2 weeks now and I feel like maybe twice out of the 14 days, it's actually asked me something relevant. More often than not, I'm using the blank page entries instead but I could just write those in my actual journal. Perhaps this app isn't for me, but it seems to work for people.</td>\n",

Perfect.\\nJournal history view is scroll-only with effective use of emoji to efficiently encode the information. Perfect.\\n\\n2) Need multiple apps\\n\\nBy way of illustration, prior to finding this app, I was using and paying for multiple apps featuring breathing exercises and CBT, to name a couple. A dedicated breathing exercise app may still be desirable for you, but if you’re easily overwhelmed such that the prospect of needing multiple apps will increase your chances of failure, know that this app contains breathing exercises and guided meditations alongside the best-in-class CBT, in my opinion.  Perfect.\\n\\n3) Daily commitment feels to complicated or involved.\\n\\nMany apps make me dizzy with what they want me to do to get better.  This one asks me to select a minimal drawing of a mouth to indicate my mood, quotes a stoic philosopher to inspire me and then gives me the option of what I want to do from there, while first gently encouraging me to journal by prompting a conversation.

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones.

I had one this morning, somewhere along the lines of \"what are you then, a mere body? a ration being.\" And I'm staring at my screen like how do I even answer this if I don't understand the question? There's other ones that are similar and because I don't understand what it's asking me to write, sometimes I'll just put \"lol\" so I can move to the next page. Then when you're done with your questions it will ask if you feel better and mostly my answer has been no because the questions it gave me were weird. You can pick what questions you'd like to be asked everyday but none of them really jump out to me as something I'd want to answer daily besides the one sentence summary of your day but even that is whatever. I do like that it tracks your mood, would be cool to have another tracker for what is causing your mood instead of the sad to happy face scale. The quotes are cool too. I've been using the app for about 2 weeks now and I feel like maybe twice out of the 14 days, it's actually asked me something relevant. More often than not, I'm using the blank page entries instead but I could just write those in my actual journal. Perhaps this app isn't for me, but it seems to work for people.   \n",

I’ve only started using this app a few days ago and OMG😳 This app is so beautiful. I’m only writing a review just so I can ask if you guys can put a password for the journal part because my mom looks through my phone and I don’t want her to read the things I write in there💀 Anyways, I do actually really love this app and its perfect from the bottom of those codes and to the top of the icon. It’s iconic honestly. Not to forget the fact that it’s been lifting burdens and weights off of my back when I type everything in details. It’s like a friend that I’ve always wanted, which is sad because none of my real (alive) friends are there for me and asks me how I am like how stoic is🥲 Ever since the app asked me the first question, I’ve poured allllll of the things I wanted to say and in details too. I- this app is like that one friend that you have that’s always there for you no matter what and genuinely cares for you so deeply and that you’re comfortable being around them even though you’ve only met last week. yknow? this app is my twin flame.   \n",

The focus breathing, the journaling, and the adaptability to each user. I have never seen such an app before. I have downloaded over 20 journaling apps, but I eventually always delete the app because I forget to journal because the app doesn’t help me. Now, this journaling app is incredible. I write 3-5 times a day and use its focus breathing exercises so much. This is the only app I want to actually support with money even though I am a stingy person.\\n\\n——\\n\\nUpdate: I do dislike the new feature where it asks you to think negatively to become grateful without being able to decline like last update. For those who are suffering depression, anxiety, and other mental issues, this is a big black hole that one can go into. I plead the developers to lock this feature away by being able to decline before the app asks you that question.   \n",
       "3      This is the app I needed. I’ve been looking for this for a long time.  What I’m here to treat: Bipolar Disorder 1, ADD, Anxiety and Relationship problems.\\n\\nWhy I have failed with past apps and what this one gets right\\n\\n1) Clutter/Non-optimal design\\n\\nDue to my extreme sensitivity and need for minimalism, other apps with their colors and complex menus were usually too much.\\n\\nThis one is white one black. Perfect.\\nJournal history view is scroll-only with effective use of emoji to efficiently encode the information. Perfect.\\n\\n2) Need multiple apps\\n\\nBy way of illustration, prior to finding this app, I was using and paying for multiple apps featuring breathing exercises and CBT, to name a couple. A dedicated breathing exercise app may still be desirable for you, but if you’re easily overwhelmed such that the prospect of needing multiple apps will increase your chances of failure, know that this app contains breathing exercises and guided meditations alongside the best-in-class CBT, in my opinion.  Perfect.\\n\\n3) Daily commitment feels to complicated or involved.\\n\\nMany apps make me dizzy with what they want me to do to get better.  This one asks me to select a minimal drawing of a mouth to indicate my mood, quotes a stoic philosopher to inspire me and then gives me the option of what I want to do from there, while first gently encouraging me to journal by prompting a conversation.  Perfect.   \n",

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.   \n",

I downloaded a couple of apps and ended up feeling like a dummy, which I was, I just didn’t want to acknowledge it I guess. Petit bambou gave me the space to try toe-dipping then wading in it and eventually sneaking off to go full on swimming with backstrokes et al in it. How did I become this addicted? Lawd !   \n",

I’ve tried some similar apps but did not give me the freedom to select different types - made me go through levels. Easy to use and pleasant voice. And the price is reasonable and got a quick response to a question I had.   \n",

None of them compare to Petite BamBou! After about a week of guided meditation, I’m calmer, more serene, with less judgement for myself and others. Can’t say enough good things about the app. & it’s various programs. Wish I’d found it years ago.   \n",

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.</td>\n",

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.   \n",

Perfect.,I’ve written a couple app reviews for this app before, but I just want to put in that after using it for about three months now, I must say that stoic is quite a wonderful app! It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.,I feel a deep debt of gratitude to the makers of this app. I feel as if I’ve been searching for just the right journaling app and this one feels like coming home to the one made just for me. I am remembering back to the time around eleven years ago when I was jumping around between different Buddhist groups trying to find where I fit in before finally feeling at home with a Zen/Ch’an Buddhist group in Colorado. Anyways, to get back on the toping of Journaling. As I’ve been exploring my inner self through meditative practices, I’ve found journaling more and more useful. I’ve also discovered practices such as Stoicism that have been very helpful too. This app seems to combine  meditative breathing exercises, with Zen and Stoic philosophy and also to be great at guiding the individual to emotional well being. Thanks for making such a great app!,I’ve tried a lot of apps like Stoic. and it’s unquestionably the best, and the only one I’ve consistently stuck with. It’s simple but comprehensive and powerful. I love it, and use the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch versions daily to very positive effect.\\n\\nMy only critique is that sometimes the morning and evening question prompts will include questions that are very similar (“how do you plan to spend the rest of today?”, “what do you plan to do today?” in the morning) and/or outright repeat questions (often “what made you smile today?” in the evening). I suspect that I could avoid this by selecting/customizing my questions, but I like the sometimes unique questions that pop up and worry that if I don’t let the app decide, my experience with that feature of the app will stagnate. However, it is sometimes disruptive to the flow to have the same or similar question come up again.,I already begin my mornings with two excellent meditation apps (Calm and Waking Up), but felt I needed something additional from a different perspective. None of the many CBT and other self-help apps was successfully filling that void. \\n\\nstoic helps me to find peace by way of a variety of tools including journaling, breathing exercises, walking meditations and other thoughtful guidance. Indeed, all common techniques, but the particular approach taken by stoic, with its clean user interface and striking graphical design, all resonated so quickly and completely within me that I paid for lifetime premium access almost immediately upon installing it.   \\n\\nMay this app be as helpful to you as it is for me.,Before finding the Stoic Journal I was on the hunt for a typical journal to write my thoughts down. One downside to a typical journal is that I always have to rely on myself to create prompts and ask myself questions. I downloaded Stoic Journal because I’m somewhat familiar with the stoic ideaology and believe in the power it can hold. \\n\\nI have been using this journal (almost daily) for just over 2 weeks now and I am loving it. It is simple to use, combines meditation and breathing exercises into my daily reflection routine and creates the prompts for me so I’m not limited to only reflecting on what I think is important. 10/10 I love this app, very well made and does what it is supposed to.,(Note: I have the premium version) I honestly love this app. As someone who had ADHD and has trouble keeping up with everyday life, this app is a good way to sit down for a second every morning and evening and think about my day. I have the questions “What are your goals for today?” And “what do you plan to do today?” asked every morning and it really helps me organize my thoughts. One suggestion I would have is the ability to turn off certain questions. Some of them I don’t understand therefore it is not helpful. Overall though, this app is wonderful and I would 100% recommend it.,Reviews are a rare occurance for me, especially for the app store, but this app has just completely changed the way I deal with things. I tried the meditation for ten minutes after school today and it\\'s just such a calming, worthwhile way to spend my time that I already signed up for the premium so I can access it on my macbook and phone. I emplore you to actually go through with this and give it a go – I deleted it after a day cause I didn\\'t think I needed it, but after downloading again I\\'m convinced this is something that makes me a better person overall.,Excellent app overall. The UI is very minimalistic and organised, yet full of things you can do. The daily reports are also very well desgined and planned out. This app is definitely one of those apps that are just present in every phone you will have owned in your life, it’s just that good! The designs and the actual usefulness of the app is very well balanced. I also have to appreciate that the app can also be customized and personalized a lot, like chaning the app icon to changing the kind of quotes you’d get, as well! \\n\\nThere is one problem though. For students like me, I think it would be very nice if you’d add an option for students like when the app asks “What is your goal?” we could answer something like\\n “📖School” and “📚Projects”. Along with that, I’d also like to ask if you can add a bit more options for the “How did you feel today?” question.\\n\\nThe app is still very nice even without these suggestions. Did and still will continue to recommend this to everyone I know!,Um, yes!\\nThis is a really great app because it helps me with my anxiety and when I get stressed out the most. It asked me how I feel about it how motivated I am and then it asks me how can I prevent it from happening. This app is really great because it just it’s like a therapist I’m telling you that now it’s like a therapist. I really suggest it but one thing it could have is a passcode maybe. I have four siblings and they might just want to annoy me like all Brothers and sisters do. They might be going to my iPad and be like oh what’s this app and then see a lot of things that I never tell them so it might be best if they add a passcode, but other than that it’s the best app that I have ever had.,I am in awe of this app and I am so glad I discovered it. I am so grateful for the personal growth I have made in the past months since I’ve been using it, and the peace of mind that I have found through using this app. It has helped me manage my fears and my anxieties, as well as introduced me to the practice of stoicism, which I have taken to heart in my every day life. I am thankful that there are so many features that I can use for free, as it can be tough to pursue guided self help on a budget. I will continue to use this app every day, and improve my life and my attitude towards existence.,i’ve been using stoic for about a week now. i had previously used a different smart journaling app, that recently locked all their content behind a paywall, which is when i switched to stoic. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING SWITCH. stoic has more than the other app had, does a better job of making me feel prepared for my day, or ready for bed, and has quality content even on the free version. i don’t often pay for apps, but plan to subscribe to stoic to show my appreciation for the high-quality product they offer!,After using this app for a week I absolutely love it and can’t recommend it enough. I’ve been reading stoicism lately and randomly came across this app. I started with the trial and decided I had to keep it.\\n\\nWhoever created this app had a really great intention because this apps core features are great. Not only do you learn more about stoicism/philosophy but you can track your days, do really simple breathing + meditation practices, track your thoughts and way more.\\n\\nThe visual design is really pleasing.,When I first downloaded this app I loved it! It provided a variety of options to cope with my emotions on a day to day basis and I loved the different journal templates to start a journaling session and the way it would use stoicism & thinking trap meditations to help me through especially rough days. However, there must’ve been an update because I no longer have access to the wide range of journal prompts and the ones I do have layer on top of one another instead of allowing for a “at your own pace” kind of app. I’m not sure if I’m ready to abandon ship yet, but I definitely am not getting out of it what I used to.,When an issue arose (and the issue was mine alone), the developer responded immediately and assisted me greatly. In the event other incorrectly associate this site with anything related to Ryan Holiday, as I did, they are not connected. \\n\\nOne app bug I do wonder about is why the daily count randomly restarts at one. Also, thought it might be cool if there was a way to print the journals (perhaps even commercially or bound- all or as a selection). Perhaps you can and I’m just not great with tech. Anyway…. Thank you for the email and I am sorry for the incorrect association.,I decided to start doing a gratitude journal after multiple books I had read preached the benefits. While the added meditation options and other add ons are nice on this app, there is a shocking amount of negativity. Activities about imaging how awful a situation can be and then being thankful it isn’t, and negative quotes. I’m a strong believer of thoughts become things and this app is completely counterproductive of what I was looking for. I tried it for a few weeks but too many examples of negative continued to arise. It is also completely black and white, pretty dark and depressing just aesthetically as well. Would not recommend for someone trying to improve your mood, definitely doesn’t hit the mark.,I would rate 4.5 if I could. I really really like this app. It gives positive quotes. It give you a positive affirmation each day. It help you reflect on what you’ve accomplished and what you can do better. I helps you set goals and achieve them. And I really like the breathing exercises. The only thing I don’t like is it’s a little glitchy sometimes. It sometimes doesn’t let me get out of the breathing exercise thing so I have to close the app. Then sometimes it doesn’t know what time it is. But overall it’s a rly good app.,I’ve tried most of the other apps that work on self-improvement, reflections, meditation, and metal health. Stoic is the only app that really helped me. It’s a perfect blend of gentle reminder, positivity and insight that I have come to crave. This app has increased my mood and ability to tackle life’s curve balls. In addition, this app has pushed me to some self-discovery and has opened my eyes to perspectives I’ve never considered. I’ve actually sent this app to family members and friends as a recommendation!,Absolutely love this app. It should offer paid content no doubt. The amount of activities and functionality this app offers is astounding considering its freemium. It’s just a bit disappointing that it seems mostly user data is the motivation behind getting people to pay for the app. I would like to see the freemium model shifted to having many of the great exercises as a paid feature and allow all users to sync and export data for free.\\nSolid app otherwise. It’s impressive.,Aesthetics, information, guided exercises, uplifting quotes, and spaces to reflect all meshed into this cute little app.\\n\\nThis is only day 2 of usage and I’m HOOKED. just what I needed to take on my journey as a Stoic. It holds me accountable and I’m so excited I get a little place to write about things regarding this philosophical realm!! I just purchased some books via kindle and now I have a little app to go right along with it. \\n\\nI’ll see how I feel after a month, so far so good for now!,I’ve used several apps before that focus on improving mental health/overall well-being, but nothing compares to Stoic. \\n\\nThis app has helped me become my own challenger of the negative thoughts I find myself facing, and empowers me to be the same person who takes them out. From thought-provoking prompts, to rewiring unhealthy thinking patterns - Stoic has been there for me to see myself genuinely feeling better compared to my mood prior to sessions.,An almost all-in-one app for people not only interested in stoicism, but looking to reflect on their daily lives and improvement. \\n\\nI love the daily questions, which makes it easier to journal three times a day. Instead of just a blank screen. \\n\\nThe only thing that keeps me from buying lifetime access are three things:\\n\\n1. A more evolved journal. Would be nice to have a more dedicated journal with calendar and tags to easily go back to what I have written or felt before. \\n\\n2. More stoicism content, like articles, podcasts, reflections, etc. \\n\\n3. More quotes by modern stoics. I usually get daily quotes by Epictetus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius and keep repeating themselves after a couple of days. \\n\\nHope the devs read this and can better improve the app. Other than that it’s my favorite meditation, journal, stoic app.,It’s my favorite app to use and is great with helping me learn more about my favorite stoic philosophers and also reflect on my own personal life and health. The only thing I feel like is missing is that I would like to get notifications in the morning and during the evening of quotes that could help through the day. Like how Bible apps do with notifications of Bible verses. Great app though and I recommend everyone to try it out!,I’ve been using this app for a few months to help keep myself grounded and manage my anxiety. It has really made a difference for me and I highly recommend it. \\n\\nI only wish the options for “What it your main focus for today?” were customizable. There are many choices that I would never use and several important ones are missing. Otherwise, I don’t believe I’d change a thing about this app.,I have been using Sotic everyday since I got it. I enjoy the dark background design. I have tried several other apps out there for journaling, but Stoic stuck with me. I\\'m not sure, something about the more stoic philosophy of the guided journal, plus the UI design of the app made me feel more engaged and can be more serious to face my feelings and my thoughts.,While it can argued that this app is beginner friendly, it packs a lot of different self-improvement and mental health practices into its routines, which may be overwhelming for beginners. \\n\\nFor example, a suggested routine may combine meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, journaling, and stoicism philosophy all into a single session (although there is an option to skip any section).\\n\\nThe premium option is unfortunately not worth the price currently. Personalization is limited; you can only select questions, activities and moods from predefined lists, which are not very extensive. \\n\\nOverall, I think it’s a great app as the free version. Premium is a let down at the time of this review.,There are so many well thought out touch points with this app. The latest version has brought functionality and improved UX that in my opinion make this the best in class app for any mindful practice. If you’re looking for the tools to face everyday with the best chance of success, look no further.,A feature of the journaling has been negative visualization. This is where you visualize awful things that could have happened but didn’t. And that’s supposed to help you become grateful. I sincerely hate this feature and wish it wasn’t included. Who wants to start or end their day not just thinking about but actually visualizing truly horrible things happening to them. It doesn’t make me grateful that those things are only imagined, just upset from having imagined them.,I downloaded this app a few days ago. So far it has been a really great way for mw to connect wirh how I\\'m feeling. Quotes and affirmations are all positive and get you thinking about how different aspects affect your life. I enjoy the unsent letters option because it allows me to \"speak\" freely without judgment or fear of being punished. Overall an amazing app and I highly recommend.,I’m really enjoying the app, and love the aesthetic, coming from mood notes which went a bit too cartoony for me.\\n\\nI’ve been having trouble with the writing interface and getting it so keep my note while I’m going through the daily exercises. There’s no confirmation it’s saved so I open it up again and it’s empty.,For anyone looking to have a casual day journal or an aggressive routine of mental exercises, this is for you. Stoicism has so much to offer everyone and they even include the option of focusing your day around Buddhist, Taoist, or Catholic teachings (or a mix of all four) if you\\'d like those instead. \\n\\nCant recommend more, seriously. \\nAlso, well worth the price of subscription.,i have worked in tech on mobile apps and so deeply appreciate the amount of care and work that has gone into stoic. it is so beautifully, elegantly done. there’s not a single thing that hasn’t been built with intention, from the soft haptics during the breathing exercises to the careful spacing of the text on the screen. it’s honestly masterful. i purchased premium simply because i want to support the developers, but this is one of those rare, incredible little tools that you can effectively use for free if you can’t afford to drop that premium $$$. that’s also a beautiful thing. bravo, developers, bravo.,When I was on the market for a mindfulness app, I searched and tried the popular ones. Meditation is meditation but when you deliver it in such simple yet philosophical way like Stoic, it doesn’t create that feeling of repulsion every time I’m trying to work and the thing tells me to breath. Perfect for the insightful and even better for the turbulent man.,I recently began to use this app and it’s something I do not regret downloading. The app is organised and pleasing to scroll through. There are notifications available that you can chose to remind you at times when you want to be. My only thing with this app is that I really wish there was a Lesbian Flag Icon.,stoic\\'s an amazing app. there are multiple exercises for calming/meditation such as journaling, meditation itself, quotes, jogging your thoughts, and setting goals. there are also 4 breathing exercises to select from depending on what you\\'re trying to achieve, which are awake, focus, relax, and calm. in the morning (if you do it twice daily) you can select how you slept the previous night, then set goals to achieve during the day. at night, you can go back and select which emotions you felt during the day and then it gives you a selection of breathing techniques to help you sleep (i.e. 478s). stoic is a really good app for just general mood and help mentally.,I highly recommend this app for anyone that’s feeling mentally lost or lost in general in life, It can help you regain focus on your life and create a small plan for things to make your day more scheduled and to notice your thoughts more. Absolutely recommended if you want to make a big change but needs serious commitment,I will always use this the amount of freedom without subscribing is amazing you only have to subscribe if you want personal extras an of course free trial because there great ide say totally worth the trial to check it out subscription is worth it ide say this is my only journal app the customizable options are great it’s just the ultimate app offers so much,I love this app! It has been the perfect way to develop and improve my journaling habit and my practice of Stoicism. It is simple and guided but full of fantastic prompts and quotes. I had difficulty syncing between my phone and my iPad, so ended up emailing the developer. The response was fast, personal, and helpful. Fantastic app and support. Thank you!,I just downloaded this app this morning and while I haven\\'t looked at it much yet, it has some great exercises that I think are really beneficial for everyone. This app gets you really thinking about your emotions, feelings, and thoughts which you tend to ignore or not think about enough!,I just love everything related to this app , i mean its THE APP i was looking for ; here is why:\\n-it\\'s really like a simple friend how would jus sit and listen to you\\n-it\\'s free!\\nyeag , it surprised me that nearly all of this apps features are free to use , i really appreciate that \\n- it\\'s simple  , not many colours in it,This is a great journaling app and they regularly add new features. Get the premium. It’s so worth it. I just wish there was a way to export to PDF with the photos I included in my journaling or to order a bound book at the end of the month or year with the photos.,I’ve stuck with it for 29 straight days, journaling morning and evenings, writing about my focus, where I’m putting my time, stating what I’m grateful for. Since I’ve started this I’ve noticed I’ve put some distance between events, my emotions, and reactions to those events.,This app really helped me and my mental health, I didn’t believe at first in mental health. But the app made me questions that I thought I had the answers to, and now I LOVE doing my morning routine and night routine. Writing my thoughts down and giving myself time. I recommended to my friends and they downloaded it so I’m happy.,I am very picky about apps that pertain to my mental health but I’ve been on this app for only 2 weeks and I have never skipped one day. The breathing exercises are genius and they even offer a certain sound to guide you in the process. Beautifully aesthetic app with so much potential. Thank you guys, I needed this!,The breathing/ meditations are really calming and surprisingly helpful... I used to not really believe in this sort of thing but it’s really nice. There are little mood checks and journaling which is good and being consistent has actually mad things better for me by a lot. I am very pleased with this app.,Enough said, unbelievable how much work was put in and for free.  Paradoxically, because of that, I see myself going for the membership just because of that.  Sales wise more developers should employ this model, let the product speak for itself,Stoic is an amazing app. Throughout many of my own personal trials I’ve turned to the app for assistance. It’s helped me overcome these trials through better understanding of myself, finding the patience I need, and finding peace. Id recommend this app to anyone who’s struggling or trying to find peace.,I am loving this app. Especially after getting a IPad Keyboard. It is easier to Type, but now they have option to scribble in which is great! Compared to other apps, I find this much “Cleaner” and easy to use!,I\\'ve only been using Stoic for a few weeks and it\\'s amazing. I love how simplistic it is and minimal it is. It also has exercises which I also love. The prompts are great. I 100% recommend this app to people who need help sorting their life out and focusing on self-care.,I find it really difficult and not feel frustrated when meditating with this app. It literally only has a motion graphic and thats it. Nothing that is helping to guide besides some white noise you can choose.\\n\\nI often use this app and after meditating feel more frustrating because just by looking at a moving motion it drives me crazy and feel worse than before I opened the app.,Much more helpful that I thought it would be\\n\\nBreathing exercises have a subtle pulse. I think it would be helpful to exaggerate the pulse at the change point. Also have the time duration selection before scrolling. \\n\\nReflection prompts are good. Some of the messaging is a bit mixed. For example a Stoic quote about being wise when you want for nothing / content with what you have, followed by goal setting. But I can see past it \\n\\nOverall - I downloaded several different apps and this is the one I’m using. \\n\\nThank you,App was asking me to sign into Apple ID every time logged in. I sent an email and immediately received a trouble shoot fix. Turned out i needed to download the newest version and everything runs smooth now.,As a Traditional Catholic, I love this app, for it really has helped spend time wisely and act more Stoically so that I may advance in the spiritual life, even if it’s just by a little bit. I strongly recommend this app, especially its journalling and routine features, for Catholics. Thank you.,The app is easy to navigate, easy to find what I need when I need it. It’s been a life saver. It was quickly integrated into my day, morning and night. I’m grateful to have found this app. Finally finding some peace,Great app to get the brain going and reflect.  Really like it.  To the developers and/or writers, there are some grammatical errors here and there that mess up the flow...more than a few.  I recommend having someone (pay a professional editor - it’s worth it) go through and proofread the whole thing.,I’ve been using Daily Stoic for over a year now. I love it. The ap keeps me focused on my growth and the things that are truly important to me. The only improvement I’d like to see is less repetition in the daily thought and writing activity.,Static is the best app ever, if you don’t download it you are truly missing out, I can get all of the meditation, and relaxation exercises I want and I don’t have to pay. I don’t even know if there is a membership option. I love it so much, it is the best,Far better than I could have hoped. I’ve been reading and learning about stoicism for years, and this app makes the practice far more automatic, and covers far more of the practical side than I expected.,This is an amazing app in my opinion. I use it very frequently and it has helped me so much with my mental and spiritual health. The breathing exercises, quotes, reflections etc. are all amazing. I can’t wait to see this app progress in the future. 10/10!!,When I open the app it always asks me how I feel and I can’t actually access or do anything until I answer with a frowny face. Why can’t I disable this? Stop throwing up roadblocks to me using the app every time I start it, it’s really irritating. \\n\\nOtherwise this is a great journaling app.,This app really gets you thinking about your day, what mental state you’re in, and what you can do to overcome it. It would be great for anyone who feels ambiguous on their path, and it’ll realign them towards a more productive future!,But the only thing I would change is the payment part this app has made me feel safe and less anxious 😊 before school and everything I love the app please take my input into consideration thanks for the app!! I love it it’s my life my A load easier🌞,The app is simple and beautiful. It’s the most simple self-care app out there. Stoic will take you slowly through your day, no need to feel like you are being forced into a crazy self-care routine.,I’ve tried tons of productivity/mindfulness/journaling apps and this is the only one that has worked for me and that I’ve had for a long time,This app has really helped me in being consistent with my journaling and meditation. The thought exercises and other suggested practices coupled with the affirmations and quotes have actually helped me get more in tune with the Stoic philosophy. This app is 100% worth it,The best free app I have ever downloaded. What a gift. \\n\\nThank you, thank you, to all who developed this. It truly makes a difference if you stick with it, all packaged in an absolutely stunning & user-friendly design. 🙏❤️🧘\\u200d♀️,i very literally like everything about this app. the only thing i would say could improve this is a to do list option, perhaps in the journal. i use this app to manage my adhd and see how i’m progressing through all the things i have to do daily as well as my long term goals. having a to-do list for days on which i have a lot of tasks would allow me to better chunk up and track my progress, further reducing stress!,Ok this will sound fake but hear me out, this is an amazing app, I was under a lot of stress and with my ADHD I have some very high emotions and get stressed really easily then this app came along and with its meditations and philosophical quotes I loved it so thanks,I was a little skeptical at first, only expecting this to be a quote app. After an hour, all I can say is thank you for creating this app. It\\'s doing wonders for my mental health already.,Check in’s 2x/day as quick or long as you like. To end each session with Mindfulness meditation, breathing exercise, or journaling; your choice and all very customizable.,For a while I kept a consistent pattern using this and it helped center my thoughts . I would recommend giving it a chance. I format is black and white which I Like. However, sometimes I get annoyed with the questions they ask .,The breathing exercises used in this app is very good for relaxing yourself and calming down. This app also really helps with getting your emotions under control avoiding any mental turmoil.,I have tried meditation and guided journaling apps for years. Not one of them comes close to stoic. The free version has a ton of content. It is the best in an ocean of mediocre apps like it.,i get easily caught up in my emotions and most of the time, i don’t know how to handle them. this app has helped calm me down and make sense of what i’m feeling throughout the day- helps keep me in check and in focus.\\n\\ni opted for the free version and it’s worked very well for me. if you could afford the paid version, i’m sure this app will do you more wonders. \\n\\nkeep up the good work.,Great app but unusable unless you type with it. \\n\\nShocking that it is not designed to use with pencil considering the proven benefits of writing by hand, especially when journaling. \\n\\nApp forces one to use pencil way up high on screen, and then constantly inserts words into different sentences anyway.\\n\\nPlease allow handwriting to be handwriting!  I don’t want or need text-to-type (and the app cannot do it properly in the first place).\\n\\nI’ll be watching for app updates in this regard, really like app otherwise but is too buggy and a real pain for those using pencil.,Try it out for a few months. It may change your thoughts and preconceived notions in life.,I had an issue with content and was immediately responded to with direction to modify in the app. Love it. On my second year.,I love the writing style and icons. The idea is amazing, but a few bugs here and there. For one thing, the walks begin and for almost all of it I have just silence. Aside from that, it’s a beautiful app with a lot of potential. I think things you read and fill in sections or write your thoughts would be cool as well.\\n\\n10/5 for the idea and future abilities\\n4.95/5 for current work\\n\\nKeep it up, please developers!,I’ve had this app for two years and I love it. Thank you so much I just wish I got it on my iCloud for free,If you are an Aspiring Stoic, or at least like philosophy, this is a must get. It is a masterpiece. It is just a shame that it does not have the fame it deserves.,Incredible app, been into stoicism for years now, great to have a product like this to keep the practice top of mind.,I love it. I especially like using voice recognition to type and keep journals.,A good way to start working from within. Great app for healing and finding balance.,It’s still crashing when going to add to goals or hide completed it’s just shuts off,I use this app every day,combined with studying Stoicism and applying the principles into my life has proven to help me develop my routine and contributed to increased serenity and peace of mind. Milan,It’s has helped me though a lot I very much recommend,I\\'ve been using the ios app for the past year and now that it is on mac I am absolutely LOVING it!,Started using right away - useful & applicable.,This thing holds me ACCOUNTABLE! I can visually track the progress of my work, exercise, and mental health. Plus it’s free.,Some buttons don\\'t seem to work. Try to slide menu items and they don\\'t respond press some-and very furs nothing happens very frustrating interface,I still have an iPhone 6\\nThe app crashes and its been crashing for a month now\\nIt doesn\\'t even open\\nThere\\'s no point in paying for the app to get my stuff out because i cant even access my stuff. \\nplease fix,Amazing job, guys. \\n\\nThis app is concise, helpful, elegant, and has a smoothly running interface. \\n\\nThank you! 🙏,Simple navigation. Can’t wait for the MAGIC to transpite 🥳,Awesome app  for reminding you that no matter what your physical and/or mental health is you still have much to be grateful  for!  Thankfully, Just Jack,I’m not able to get past the You Have Stoic Premium page to try this app out. Disappointing for me as a first time user to not even be able to get the app working.,Everyone needs to download this app for its free and very helpful and easy to use!!🥰,Has brought so much joy and contemplation,I love this app, it’s free and easy to use. It has some very good exercises and I love their breathing ones,I keep coming back to this app..  It is a simple unintrusive program.,The Stoic is a great way to start the day and ground ourselves in real truth and clarity about our circumstances. I love the exercises!,A truly wonderful app; I use it every single day! 🎶,I never write reviews about apps but this app is truly amazing,this app is incredible. one of the things that is keeping me relatively sane. one thing it needs is a lot more affirmations. it\\'s getting repetitive using the same ones for my home screen widget every day. other than too few affirmations, this app is perfect!,I pleased with this app. I’m a stoic so that might have something to do with it.,stoic helps me feel better about myself!,this is quite literally the best app i’ve ever installed, i’m really working to better myself and this app is helping me get there. it helps me organize my thoughts and think more positively about situations. highly highly recommend!!,Free stuff good... Can\\'t afford the rest, wish I could,This really help with stress and anxiety. It’s good to use. I love it!! If I get nervous at home or school I use it.,this app is very helpful. in the beginning middle and end of my day i fill out this feeling thing and yeah. GET IT MISS GIRL \\n\\nIFOAKEKFJOSKFJEJNKKGKEKRKTKFKWKK,I love this app so much and I write 3 times a day. It’s super easy and there are different excersises to do!,this app is really good. it helps with my anxiety, and makes me way more calmer. these questions they ask are very calming as well. i also like the meditation feature that is very needed. well done.,On affirmations - obviously this app was not created by a native English speaker. I feel like my I.Q. is going down with all the grammatical errors on Social Media platforms, hence I don’t wanna see them on apps too.,this app is amazing and really does help me be grateful for life and helps with my anxiety, it’s really great. i don’t pay anything i’m not sure what the paid version has but the free is amazing,By far the best journaling app I’ve ever used,This app seems legit and it helps you reflect,i never really write reviews so i don\\'t really know what to say but this app has made me feel better and i think it\\'s really great,it’s only my 3rd day on here and i look forward to using this app in the morning and the evening. it has been helpful me thinks.,i love the simplicity and design of this app. it’s straight forward and has been really helpful. overall, it’s not exactly my style, but it’s great and i love it!,Thoughtful prompts for journaling and i like the mood tracker,I loved this app until they added Bible verses. Why? Why would you ruin the quote section of a secular app with religious quotes?,Love this cute widget on my Home Screen A+,Really enjoy it!,Love this app!,Phenomenal app. No complaints.,Nags for reviews too much, so this is what you get,I love stoic,Fantastic.,Literal es una ayuda Psicológica que me ha brindado calma y orden. Lo único que no me gusta es que para que se guarden los datos tienen que ser premium :(,joann,Best stoic app ever,My only complaint doesn’t stop me from giving 5 stars. The issue is there is a copycat app on android. And it would be nice to buy premium and have the ability use this iPad at home and my phone on the road.,Like pretty much everyone else, I noticed my mental health had a deep decline in the fall and winter months. I already suffer from anxiety and I knew I needed to make some changes in my life, but I wasn’t sure where to start or what app might be best. I have had one other meditation app in the past and went to use it again, but I was frustrated with the pay wall so I kept searching, hoping I could find something that would also help me set intentions for what I want to get out of my practice. I was especially interested in something that would correspond between meditation and sleep, as I have been experiencing sleep problems in recent months which are completely new to me.\\n\\nI am so thankful and happy to have come across Shine! The structure of the app is both easy to navigate for simple daily use, but also wonderful to explore deeper practices. I really enjoy having bios of all the speakers, as it makes me feel more connected to who I am taking time to meditate with.I literally just downloaded the app two and a half days ago, so I haven’t had as much time to explore all the features and benefits but I’m already cooked.\\n\\nSpeaking back to the paywall, I was even more excited to learn that this is a minority and female owned company, so I had zero hesitation in paying for premium. The cost is about the same for many other apps, so why not support the awesome women behind this fantastic app?!?!!,I can’t get over how much I love Shine. I used to use headspace but I found the meditations repetitive and I didn’t feel like they did much more than tell me to breathe. Shine has so many different kids of meditations, one of my favorites being the daily rituals that go along with activities like drinking coffee, doing makeup, commuting, doing dishes, and even waiting. And the daily shine always feels tailored to me, like they know exactly what I need to hear that day. And I love the encouragement to reflect and jot down a few notes, which I like looking back on. I just love this app so much!!! \\n\\n(If a developer is reading this, I do have two minor requests. When I finish the meditation, the quiet music continues for a moment but then stops during the reflection. Is there a way for it to keep going while I type and reflect? Two — it always seems to miscount my streak, I think that might be a bug. Love you!),I am a behavioral therapist and I recommend this app to all of my clients, and use it myself as often as I can. I love the meditations, I’m OBSESSED with the guided journaling, and the sleep music library has honestly been a game changer for my nighttime routine. My only suggestion for the creators is to get some content regarding frustration with one’s health and specifically loving oneself when it feels like your body or your mental health are working against you. I am disabled and could see myself making content like this for my clients because it’s difficult to find elsewhere, but I would love even more for it to be on this app so I can do them for myself (it’s more difficult to be kind to oneself than others in my experience). Overall the app is wonderful and absolutely worth the subscription fee even though I don’t use it every day. Please keep up the great work.,I’ve tried many meditation apps and podcasts before, but I’ve never found something as unique as The Shine App.\\n\\nThe app is so intuitively created, and well written so that you truly have a self-care journey. Special mentions to the weekly intentions that they let you set, so that recommended content is shown to fit your chosen affirmation!\\n\\nThe Shine App also excels with it’s guided structure. Every morning they prompt you with an exceptional guided meditation, a reflection, written takeaways, recommended articles, and then 2 quick questions to note down your gratitude. It has introduced the perfect morning routine!\\n\\nThe meditations are extremely well edited, with high quality audio and soothing tones! I have to give a shout-out to Mel Chanté, her daily meditations are well written and amazingly delivered.\\n\\nLastly, I have to applaud the fact that the app is created by two women of color— this is well reflected in the content created. As the majority of the meditation speakers are of color! Not to mention, many meditations touch on racial healing and wellness. \\n\\nAs a WOC who meditates, much of the podcasts I listen to are mostly led by white women, so it is nice to see my values and identity represented at Shine. \\n\\nBest. App. Ever.\\n\\nWill continued to support as much as possible. Thank you to everyone who helped created this! ✨,I use to love Shine.... I used it every single day. You know, shine use to be a beautiful app that helped me so much with my anxiety and depression. I use to be able to listen to new voices and people helping me every day. I use to connect with them on social media. Tracking my mood. Listening to meditations and enjoying daily shines, sleep help, so much and I go into a slump for some months to come back to find out all I can do I pretty much check in. You have to pay to have access to more than 90% of the app now. Banking off people on a app that cost not only significanty less not even a year ago, but yeah didn\\'t cost to track moods... Like come on. Most people can\\'t even afford health care and you\\'ve turned Shine into one of \"THOSE\" apps. I guess I\\'ll find an alternative to get back into shape and help me with my anxiety. Youper now offers the best help, along with \"insight timer\". Over 90k free meditations free. Smh. It\\'s so unethical and sad what this app has changed into. So so much different. I never leave all reviews or have to delete apps I love but this will be it. :(,This app has been a mind saver. Mental health has always been a struggle for me. I’ve had much trauma in my life, so have always read and been immersed in the practices of mindfulness and resilience. I needed something to go along with the therapy I was doing, and wasn’t finding anything that I could solely rely on. The Shine app served it all! As a POC it was refreshing to find a community here of POC’s sharing their wisdom. It’s so rare to see POC’s in this industry. Knowing that they were POC gave me an added layer of comfort and relatability which has definitely been a refreshingly different experience. I started the app on free service for a few weeks to really learn if it was for me. I’ve just subscribed to the paid today, absolutely no regrets and continue to look forward to the progress I can learn here. Thank you Shine App!,I love the Shine app. I used to use Headspace but I’ve found this app to be more personal and helpful. Compared to Shine, headspace is sterile, un-interactive, and less diverse. The subscription is totally worth it. \\nRoom for improvement: the app doesn’t work well with Sign In With Apple so I had to switch to an email for a smoother experience. I’m my experience, the start-up screen flashes once or twice which isn\\'t a big deal but makes the app feel a bit less polished. Lastly, I would love to have a dark mode. I use the app at night a lot and the white background is super bright. Overall, amazing app and I would recommend to anyone looking for mindfulness and less worries in their daily life. This app is a great addition to my ‘toolkit’.,I\\'ve really been enjoying taking little breaks here and there with the meditative sessions curated to my weekly goals and just looking through the library for what I want to work on in that particular moment: calming my anxiety, staying motivated, or taking a moment to be grateful. \\n\\nI love that there\\'s a range of shorter to longer sessions for any occasion or mood. An improvement I\\'d like is for the audio to keep playing even after my screen locks. Otherwise if I fall asleep to a relaxation session, my phone will just stay in the app all night until it dies which isn\\'t great when I use my phone for an alarm.,I love this app and have been using it to maintain my commitment to meditation and mental health! Unfortunately, I find that usually at night, the check-in function gets glitchy and it’s impossible to move forward and complete it—at least, it appears incomplete. The next day, however, I discover that my attempts at entering information have gone through, to the tune of four or five times. So i’ll have 4 or 5 copies of the same “my gratitude” information, for example. Since I cannot erase them after the fact, I’m  stuck with all of it. Irritating. Either fix the bug and make users able to remove what they entered.,Context: I only tried the free version, not the premium\\n\\nThis app uses psychological treatment for anxiety using mindfulness, the awareness of experience in the present, and acceptance and commitment therapy which uses mindfulness skills that helps to accept and deal with upsetting  thoughts or feelings, understanding values and using values to change said behavior. \\nThe app also gives an outlet to others to talk to which isn’t something that connects specifically to a psychological treatment but is a good way to relieve some stresses of anxiety. \\nOverall, this app features many good options for someone with anxiety. Some features that I thought were great resources or options for someone who has anxiety are:\\n\\nJournaling\\nTalking with others (that use the app)\\nMeditation\\nIn the moment joys\\n\\nI would give this app a 4.5 but I can’t give half stars (I’m not sure why). I think that the app could improve by adding an option to talk with a therapist or having a therapist look over group conversations (I couldn’t tell if something like this was happening or not so I was a bit concerned).,This app is really great! It is easy to use, feels safe and welcoming. I love that it gives you options if there is a section you aren’t in the mindset to complete if you aren’t able to gather your thoughts in that moment. I also like that it gives you the option to listen to a meditation, read something, type something, or speak vocally- it is inclusive of all forms of communication! You also have the option of connecting with others and seeing what they want to share on their. It is uplifting, positive, and calming. I highly recommend Shine!,I’ve been a member of shine for so long I’m at 800 check ins. I love the content and it’s finally something I have that fits me and my morning routine.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nSince the format has changed, I feel scattered, I have to jump all around the app in order to get the meditation, article, and then finally the check in. The way it was—in text form—was so intuitive and had a wonderful flow. This is disjointed and it’s just really disappointing. Not only that, but since the change none of the things I have bookmarked have shown up in my favorites, so now I cannot access certain things. I know I am not the only one struggling with this but I just can’t get used to it.,This app has meant so much to me. Even my 4 year old daughter loves it & asks for it every night before bed. She calls it “the calm thing”. The soothing voices, the wonderful messages, the breathing. It’s all been so good. I know I’ll be sad when my year subscription runs out, but am so thankful for the time we’ve had so far. Especially during this exceptionally bizarre time in life, pandemic, presidencies, staying distant from our friends & family... it’s nice to have a “friend” who can give you some positive words of support & reassurance. Thank you ladies!,I love this app. It is so well designed and the content is quality. If everyone used this app, they would be happier. There are a few things I wish this app had: a longer journaling section, as to reflect more in depth , an option to view previous days and journaling to reflect on your progress and previous lessons, a way to queue meditations or articles to read for later or for the next day. Having those things would improve my experience using this app!!,I would undoubtedly recommend this app to anyone. If you have stress or anxiety, a lack of confidence or self esteem, or just want to relax your mind, this app is for you. I would recommend trying their free meditations first to make sure you like it, but paying for all the mediations is well worth it. Their SHINE method for anxiety is amazing, and doing the daily shine every morning makes my days start off so much better. Plus I genuinely feel like they are a great company with good intent and give love and support to any marginalized group.,It’s wild how much someone can feel seen all through a meditation app. I just started using meditation apps before I downloaded this one and now I’ve deleted the others. Having women of color from around the world being the voices for this is nothing short of amazing. On top of that the simple examples of struggles, the topics, they just relate so well to women of color. I didn’t realize their could be something like this and now I can’t go back. Thanks for making this!,This app is aesthetically pleasing, clean, simple, beautiful... but there is so much on there. Affirmations, gratitude, guided meditation, and awesome notifications that allow me to check in with myself and my goals. And their free option provides all these things, and then subscribing just opens the door to more. Unlike other meditation apps, you can actually find a lot of benefits from the free version, making it super accessible and a great place to start! I love it and highly recommend it.,I found a lot of the content was recycled. I receive emails from shine way too often. And, while I downgraded my subscription months ago, earlier this month it had been renewed anyway. Had I not reviewed my credit card statement I would not have noticed. I’m not sure if this is because they are somewhat disconnected from the subscriptions in the App Store. I submitted a case to Apple Card. Also, I find the app glitchy. To address this issue, I tried to click the support menu item at the bottom. It only took me to a blank screen.,I wrote here over a year ago upset I was unable to receive the promised daily text.  I still don’t get a text (unsure anyone does now), but it doesn’t matter because the intuitive push notifications arrive every morning and every night.  They are a welcome inspiration to set the tone for each day and a thoughtful reflection to ponder every night.  I am genuinely grateful for Shine.,Shine feels like I’m surrounded by a group of friends who stand in my corner cheering for my success and well-being. Shine was created with me, a Black woman, in mind and that alone feels powerful. I have a variety of meditation themes to walk me through different emotions. I really enjoy checking in regarding my mood and free-writing to expound on why that particular emotion is present. The daily shine kickstarts my day and sets me up for success.,I love that this app has female voices! It has a beautiful and calming interface and the functions of this app are pretty cool. If you have the paid version you can complete check ins and based on what mood you report, they make recommendations on a meditation for how you are feeling. It tracks your progress and I think it will be so cool to go back and look at how I was feeling months ago. This app has been such a blessing!,I don’t currently have the money for tons of subscriptions right now. I barely have enough for the ones I’m already paying. This looks to be a meditation app, and usually the content in those is pretty decent, if bare bones, for free. In this I can’t even access my past logs without paying! Am I signing up for a service or have I already signed my information over to your company? I don’t like the start of this, already. Only the content YOU put out should be under YOUR paywall. YOU lock the content I put in your meditation app, and it starts looking EXTREMELY shady...,Don\\'t worry, besides needing your credit card to try it out right from the start, if you do pay you\\'ll have the option to have meditations sponsored by GrubHub. You wanting me to pay for meditations sponsored by GrubHub is crazy.\\n\\nForcing politics in to every turn, they just want to add to the overwhelming situations. Trying to put enough guilt on someone to stay with this half-baked app despite so many shortfalls. \\n\\nSo many great options exist, this needs to fade away and go where apps go after their time is up. Look in to Insight Timer, Headspace, or Calm for a real meditation app, this doesn\\'t cut it.,I suffered a mental breakdown last summer. It was so severe that I was off for 6 months under going talk therapy, sound and meditation therapy and now taking mild meds. I wanted to continue my new practice of meditation and journaling but I wanted a motivative nudge. I found this in Shine. I completely go through all of the daily words of encouragement and meditation and mental check ins. I appreciate the developers of the app.,I have a new iPhone. \\nWhile I love Shine, and purchased the premium subscription, the app user interface always frustrates me. The top back button on the top left keeps sending me back to the App Store instead of the previous page.  The app had multiple crashes and I had to reinstall so it would work. My premium subscription was not popping up. The bottom content menu looks jammed.\\nSeriously Shine?\\nThis is a wonderful mind resource, just make the app experience better and it will be super awesome! For now, I am going back to Calm ... sorry.,I am so glad I invested in this app. It was been transformative for me, helping to reshape my thoughts and give me a gentle reset anytime I need it. Absolutely love the Shine app! Plus, it is integrated with so much scientific psychological research. As a Licensed Clinical Psychologist, I approve and share many of the meditations with my clients during our sessions as well. Thank you for making this available for us!!,I love this app! I meditate every morning now and I don’t regret it. However, when I complete a Daily Shine session, the check mark doesn’t immediately appear below today’s date. Whenever I kill the app, it will tell me to sign in again. After I sign in, the check mark will appear. This has been happening to me for the past couple of days, so I hope you will fix this!,I deliberately I clicked on Shine to view what it “had to say”, I forgot I had this subscription.  Am pleased with the inspiration it gave me.  I am very displeased with my life thinking I have failed with no hope of it getting better.  Then Shine suggested I make  it better by deciding what I will do today, and then at the end of the day review what I have done.,Been using your services for about 10 months.  Has helped just stay calm in a crazy year until the last couple weeks and had a sudden breakup that led me to a very dark place.  I’m not out of it but the app has helped so much with pulling me back towards the light.  Thank you so much!,In 2020 they hiked the price up and the content became predictable and depressing. Not everybody was struggling mentally during 2020. I had an amazing year and wanted to continue to work on some areas around personal growth. Yet I felt like every daily shine and exercise became centered around COVID stress and there was no longer a good balance of subjects covered. If I could have gotten a refund for this last year, I would have. I used to recommend it a lot but stopped this last year.,I have been trying to deepen my spirituality with meditation for months and struggling to make it click, but I just found this app and am immediately hooked. I cannot describe the comfort of hearing a woman’s voice who sounds like someone I might actually know and trust guiding me. 10/10 recommend.,Since being introduced to the shine app back in April 2020 I have listened to it every. Single. Day. It has helped me through so many hard moments and given me the support and  tools I need to navigate this messy 2020 and life. I cannot say enough nice things about it. Thank you Shine!,I absolutely love the simplicity and profound nature of this app. As a mental health professional I always recommend this app to my clients because it just breeds mindfulness and centering. I look forward to the evening stories. I never realized how impactful it would be to be able to check in with myself every day.,When working I’d gift this to others it’s so fantastic. It’s really easy to use. Understands the user and what we’re experiencing right now. It’s on point! But it’s not working left and right! I have the most recent version, just praying for improvements soon!,Almost addicted to the soothing voices, calming music, and comforting message - especially during a time such as this. As a black female entrepreneur, I’m certainly happy to support another minority business. However have found difficulty\\npaying online for the premium status...,Just the other day I was thinking to myself how it would be nice to have a meditation app with Black Voices as the narrations. Then low and behold I saw the Shine App on IG. I was like “God, even my most smallest request you answer”. Thank you! I just signed up last night and I am enjoying the mediations. 🥰,I have purchased reflection journals and listened to other apps but this one is different. This app is perfect because in their voices is my voice, my experiences. Every episode so far has resonated deeply with me as a Latina who often suffers from imposter syndrome. Thank you for this app!,This app has helped me be mindful of my mind and body and has also helped me through stressful work, personal, and school related events. There are fantastic mantras, journal prompts, and meditations. I highly recommend this app when I can!,The prompts are so great, really encourage your presence in life.  I really enjoy the voices/meditations that are in this app.  Really love it, and can feel the level of genuine care put into this.  Can’t recommend it enough, well worth the price.,I really love this app, and it’s my favorite meditation app. I HIGHLY recommend it to any BIPOC or just someone who wants a more relatable voice. Only reason I gave four stars instead of 5 is bc it really needs a dark mode, since I tend to use at night and the bright opening screen wakes me up.,Thank you for creating an app that not only pertains to me but honors me for all that I am! I feel acknowledged and supported by like-minded souls and skins. I am now shining brighter just a little bit more each day with this app in my daily routine.,It’s unfortunate, I downloaded the app before the recognition it received caused them to lock literally almost. EVERY. Mediation. On. The. App. You get a free trial but after that it’s a ridiculous price for $54/yr or $15/month. It’s a really good app and seriously works. It’s just a lot of money to spend given the current predicaments of this pandemic.,I’ve incorporated this app into my morning routine and I absolutely love it. I often share it with friends and family and I truly believe it’s one of the tools that will help heal my community.,This app is the most motivational app ever made. Thank you for being so real and inspiring to my life. This app helps me with everyday life struggle happiness love peace joy and respecting others. Thank you shine for loving me and other across the globe.,This is my favorite app. I’ve tried Calm. These mediations are more in tuned with what I need on a day to day. They’re more grounding and the follow up after the meditations are short sweet and help me internalize the tool I learned through the mediation. I use it daily!,And the first meditation was immediately soothing and inspiring to listen to. I felt like I was taking care of myself just by being present and listening to the teacher,This would be a five star rating if not for the problems I constantly have with the app.. I get logged off every time I close the app and can’t figure out how to stay logged in. I’d appreciate any help on it!,I deleted the app as soon as I downloaded it because it wanted to require me to try the premium version for free. That is so annoying. I don’t want another paid subscription, and I don’t want to have to do the extra work of entering my payment and then canceling. The option to use the “lite” version would have been nice.,This app is so good & has been a great addition to my life. I have been using it almost every single day for the past year. I am so grateful to have found this!!,I’ve tried so many, I have a few mental health disorders and physical diseases and this is the only app that I ever loved. It is the best one. I think everyone should get it.,Such a great tool!! One of the best self therapy tools out there!! Meaningful yet not time consuming. I love that it’s focused Women of Color and not white women centered 💜💜💜,Had a great experience contacting customer service for this app. They responded quickly and made me feel like they really cared.,Shine has become an essential for my life \\nit has a layer of protection around me each day and allows me to feel I am enough!,I tried a lot of the anxiety, mindfulness, and mental health apps. Some get bits and pieces right. But, this is the first to get all of it right.\\n\\nI really like the daily check in. Instead of it telling you what you need, it asks what you need and provides it in an incredibly useful way.\\n\\nThe app is beautifully designed.\\n\\nJust about everything about it is well done. Bravo!,I just downloaded this app but I find it is very helpful in gratitude and what you should focus on instead of all the negativity.,Really good experience and felt the personal touch ! \\nVery personal and real! Voice and words related to me and my style! \\nNice!,This is my first day on this app! I really enjoyed it and looking forward to becoming a better me in 2021!,Felt I am important enough to take 8 minutes to reflect!,I absolutely love this app, and now I wish it were a skill on my echo device so I can add it to my morning routine.,Thank you for helping find time to do the simple things in life.,Its a good app when it’s working. The daily meditations started glitching and shutting themselves down within the first two minutes which renders the free part of this app useless. Fix bugs!,I never wrote reviews but the monthly price for premium is insane. For founders that want to help people it seems greedy and disingenuous. \\n\\nYou can’t utilize most of the features advertised without being a premium member. You can only use their recommended meditations, can’t even check in.,Use to love this app, but for past few weeks it has stop working.  It doesn’t track my daily progress unless I restart my phone. Today is Monday but app is stuck on Friday.  Please fix the glitches. Using the app is stressful which defeats the purpose of the app.,This is way more than a media ration app.  It really lets you connect with yourself.,I love this app .. the meditations and other features are amazing, calming and inspiring. Getting through this time is so much easier now.,This is my very first time learning about Shine. I made a purchase this morning and I did the meditation..... Magnificent and feeling Grateful!\\nNamaste 🙏🏽 \\nTanya,Using the shine app has made my morning ritual a lot more simple and satisfying.   I love it,This app was just pretty ok. They left out a whole word in one of their inspirational messages to me so I removed it. You can’t convey a serious message when you can’t even utilize a proper grammar check. #myinnerkarensayshi,Loving this app so far and I haven’t even started my free Week yet🥰,For years I have struggled with Anxiety/Panic Disorder or better known as GAD. This app has brought so much positivity to my routine.,I create change in my on way... I am who God say I am...,In time of distress,crisis, I go to Shine to get present, grounded. Meditations, soothing guidance, makes me feel I’m not alone. Love my Shine!!,This helps me and supports me as battle through my mental health. \\n\\nThank you!,I only left one star because I don’t feel I should pay for all the features. But leaving a gratitude chat did help me feel good about being real about my feelings and mental health through the chat....,but also stop logging me out everytime i close the app 😐,Logged out 5 times now and the app does not fit the borders of the screen correctly.,I love this app! It is so helpful!,Tried for the first time. Felt excellent. Wonderful voice projection.,This might as well be a paid app, there’s literally only one mediation you can use otherwise. Useless,Wow! Loving it already.,I thought this was free surprised to learn they want 53 dollars a year. Isn’t much really but. Idk. Seems like a lot.,The app barely worked and the meditations seemed played out,Latest version locked up.,New phone and it does load,Great app,Awesome,It’s a great app  I was able to find a half off code sent to me so I can enjoy the full benefits,I cancelled in the time allotted. I downloaded the app through the App Store on Apple . They charged me this year . And I looked back at my records they charged me last year . I sent them the text help@shine text.com . Two years ago to cancel .I’ve even deleted my App . Now when I try to get help on the app with subscriptions . The page is blank . Contacting my Bank to dispute the charges .,I love this app very much. I really like all the tools it has to improve mood. The primary reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five stars Hass to do with the accessibility with voiceover. Voiceover is an accessibility service that changes how the device works to help blind and visually impaired people like me use the touchscreen. In order for voiceover to work well, the app and the interface Hass to be programmed right. Don\\'t get me wrong, because I do think this is one of the most accessible apps for mood out there, but it is lacking a couple of things with voiceover accessibility. For example, when I try to customize the days for a reminder, voiceover does not give me any indication of which days are checked off. For the days that are checked off for the reminders, why not have voiceover say something like M selected or M checked? That would give blind and visually impaired users an indication that Monday is checked off. Otherwise, everything else about this app is great. If it wasn\\'t for the voiceover accessibility problem, then I would give this five stars.,The app is pretty awesome to be honest. I never thought I’d be keeping track of my moods through an app but here I am…. And it’s definitely helped me with keeping track of my moods and other daily goals I set. The CBT part of the app is probably my favorite though. Anytime I have distorted thinking, I’ll go in the app and write out why I was feeling the way I was, or at least try to figure out why I was feeling like I was and try to work through it so I can try to rewire the way my brain acts I’m certain situations. I have adhd, bi-polar disorder as well as a couple other disorders and this app has definitely helped in keeping me somewhat sane…. Try it out!,I truly love this app. I\\'ve been using it since around September 2020, and I am starting to schedule it back into my routine again. It helps me to develop a schedule around understanding my emotions and anchoring me during rough parts of the day. \\n\\nThe only thing that I wish was better was how long the loading time is when I update an activity. Navigating the app is a difficult because the page-loading-time is slow, even when connected to stable WiFi. This is something that needs to be improved upon, especially when you have a subscription. However, it is a wonderful resource despite app navigation.,I have been testing several free emotion trackers as a therapist to recommend to my clients and this one is my favorite. It’s not super fancy or cute like some of the others, but it is incredibly easy and straightforward, and has several helpful (and research based) tips and skills for different moods and such. It does a lot more than track mood, but food, exercise, gratitude, etc. The designers did a great job.,I was stuck in a lot of laziness and bad habits and didn’t know what steps to take to bring myself out of it. This app is helping me be mindful and take action in my life rather than letting it pass me by. I can’t wait until a year from now when I get to look at my progression and actually see the improvements I’ve made. Awesome app! Would recommend!,I have tried multiple apps to help with my anxiety & depression- this one allows me to track everything in one place, making it very easy to describe my moods in words- helps me to refocus with positive prompts- which I can change the topics of easily. I am a pen & paper girl, but this app helps me consistently track the things I want to!!,So I’m a broke college kid so I can’t pay, however with the tools of the reminders and even having the 6 daily activities have done WONDERS for my mood. Thanks developers for making free aspects still very very useful, it’s been hard trying to find something that’s free. I really am deeply grateful for this app :),I am really liking this app.  I love that there are so many options for customization that make the  mindfulness activities personal for what I need.  I like that the sources are listed on the educational materials so I can read the actual research if I want. This is the most comprehensive app for mindfulness that I have found.,I have found Moodfit to be such a helpful app for me. 2020 has been a challenging year consisting of a lot of change that hasn’t been fully processed. This app has helped me slow down, put negative thoughts into perspective, and focus on gratitude and mindfulness, which is helping so much as I progress into this new year.,This app has changed my life! It has so many features and keeps me constantly in check with my mental health. I’m more aware of my thoughts , feelings, and reality. Helps me stay grounded and has tons of in app features to get you through tough moments. 10/10 recommend!,I haven’t been using this app for long but the statements that are sent really help ground me. I found it as I was researching on resilience for my project ideas. Team has agreed this is going to be one of the interventions to help!! Paying it forward helps with resilience too😊,I personally like this app, particularly the gratitude and mindfulness practices. They help me stay centered and content with where I’m at in life. The little messages throughout the day also make me feel better and surprisingly come up at the right time.,Love this app! I would HIGHLY recommend it for all ages. It definitely helps. Especially, people w/chronic anxiety & depression. My daughter has both plus PTSD and it helps her too. The free version is amazing as is, we are thinking of upgrading.,Even without paying for premium, this app is really worth it. I have depression and I find that acknowledging my emotion, I’m feeling a lot better. I would definitely recommend this, and it’s really easy to use :),I have struggled with bipolar, panic attacks and ocd for years. Moodfit helps me stay focused on easy to accomplish daily goals which helps me stay grounded and calm. This app helps me feel like I CAN control my emotions when I have a stressful night/day at work. I Love it!,Only used a few days, but I like the many customizable options even on the free version. Received a msg yesterday about an extended free premium trial for submitting a review but with an expiration date of three days earlier. Doing it anyway and counting it as a hopeful action for the day!,This app is fantastic. Especially appreciate the mood tracker and the breathing exercises. I feel much more in control of things rather than things controlling me. Thank you!,The apps is somewhat helpful with teaching me some techniques to how to relieve some stress, but it’s honestly short when it comes to helping feeling better. Also, that fact the app locks more ways to help stress behind is a pay wall is awful. I recommend finding something much better.,This app is a must! Has carried me through the pandemic, helping me focus on my strengths & providing me help with focus. Got my husband using it now & we are grateful for it.,This is a wonderful app I recommend to several clients. It has a lot of great tools.,I’ve only been using the moodfit app for a few days but it’s a great tool to keep you focused on your mental health.,I’ve just started using.  This app has so much to offer. Easy to personalize .  Discusses gratitude, breath work , journaling , CBT and more!!!,Use it every day. Helps me to know where I’m at and what I need to do to become better.,Same notifications for support. Did not change habits- just created a new habit to delete the notification,Loving the app so far,This app is great for tracking mood along with factors and activities that impact it.,App slow sometimes but content v good,This is the journal for me!\\n👍🏻simple \\n👍🏻CBT\\n👍🏻mood graph\\n👍🏻tips, tools and reminders\\n👍🏻consistently use it\\n👍🏻fast response time from company\\n👍🏻grateful journal\\n👍🏻track meds, exercise, mental health visits,I’ve used slumber for almost a year. Some of the narrators I like better than other, which is why being able to search by narrator is handy. They choice of stories is great, short stories to narratives that are a couple hours long. You can also learn something while listening, they have stories to take you to other countries or teach you about history, and some are just for fun. The sounds relaxing music is nice too but I still prefer to listen to the stories, with soft music in the background. There are even children’s stories for parent who need something to help their little ones fall asleep. Less expensive than other apps and I kinda of prefer not having “celebrity” voices which make me start thinking about their movies or something instead of focusing on the story.,Slumber has a lot of the typical travel log type stories, some badly written formulaic story-like offerings, relaxation type meditations and these may be fine for many people to fall asleep. They also have a few of my favorites: wonderful voices reading very well written material. Some of these include The Jungle Book, Sherlock Holmes, The Wizard of Oz, etc. One of my very favorite readers, Abby Offer (sp? Sorry Abbie?) is found here but I wish she read better material. The guy who reads about the Norse gods, and the French Whisperer along with several others are excellent. If you want these readers, Slumber is a good second app to the best one, which eclipses them all with hundreds of thousands of free meditations and a sleep section far larger than any other entire app: Insight Timer. Plus for less than many apps you can go to Premium to support the site!,I’m a psychiatrist and recommend this app to patients with sleep trouble regularly. I myself have been using it for a couple of years now and have listened to over 700 sessions so far and continue to love how it’s developed over time. I now have a nursing newborn and this program is a lifesaver when trying to get back to sleep after a night waking. The premium subscription has been worth it for the variety offered and the regularly new content. The customer service has been great. I can’t say enough positive about Slumber. It has definitely changed the sleep game for me. I highly recommend using sleep headphones with it. Happy sleeping!,I have a special needs child who has difficulty falling asleep. Slumber has changed all that, and there is less ‘drama’ at bedtime, due to the variety of stories and how well the stories are presented. New stories are added on a regular basis, so we don’t have to keep cycling through the same ones.\\n   One thing I’d like to see added is a way to know which new stories were recently added, such as a counter showing how many times the given story was selected / played, by the individual user. This would also help determine which stories may be favorites or less favorite. Ordering options by most frequently played vs least played would be very helpful.,I\\'ve been using this app without a subscription for months and I LOVE it. I can only listen to the free stories/sounds, which rotate every once in a while. \\n\\nThere are so many types of sleep stories to choose from. They vary from adventures, to travel, to boring stuff like bird migration (honestly my fave) and different voices tell each story. \\n\\nYou can add background noises such as a calming music, running river, crickets chirping, fire crackling, a ceiling fan, and a few others. It gets even cooler because you can adjust the volume of each sound individually! For example, I like my sleep story to have low music, fire crackling and river flowing in the background. \\n\\nYou can set the story to play once, repeat twice, or infinity times. I like to set it for 2x just in case it takes me a while to fall asleep. The app also has an optional bedtime reminder notification. \\n\\nDefinitely no need for subscription (use the FREE stories!) although I may invest in a subscription considering I use the app every night for bed.,I hate to ding this app. I love Abbe and Thomas and Nadine and all the British storytellers. I almost always fall asleep to the stories within 15 minutes or so. The trick is to try to stay awake, and you’ll fall asleep. It it turns out, however, that there’s also a podcast that has almost all the same stuff, and more, at least the stories.  So I feel kind of silly having paid for this. I don’t really need the soothing music as there are hundreds of those on streaming services. The podcast is called get sleepy. It’s free, and stories go on there before they hit here. Watch, I bet Mythology of the Moon by Abbe Offer will be next in line on this paid app. I already listened to it for free though.,I’m shocked at how much this app really helps me. My mind goes into overdrive starting at 10pm and my thoughts make it nearly impossible to fall asleep naturally. I thought that hearing voices while trying to fall asleep would not work—but it does. The stories are great because I dont like typical meditations that force me to focus on my body, breath, etc. because I want to GET OUT of my achey body. It really does help to take my mind off of the anxiety of trying to fall asleep. Something about the intimacy and tenderness of the voices feels primal—like going back to being a child and having a parent help you off to sleep.,Has helped me fall asleep, highly recommend. Calm has lots of different things, whereas slumber focuses more on just sleep stories - a relaxing narrator telling a relaxing story. These are not only fiction “stories” - my favorite are the science or history based ones - for example, teaching you about prehistoric structures. My favorite narrators are “the French whisperer” and Abbe Opher.\\n\\nMy only concern is that I am moving through them faster than new ones are being added - particularly non-fiction. We will see if I’m still using in a few months or if I’ve gone through all the non-fiction.,I been able to sleep now that I been using slumber but on the nights that the regular stories I use don’t work and I am still up for hours not being able to sleep (and I feel like I’m not the only one) I think there should be a section of sounds and stories for those kind of nights. Like for example a story about racing or about fishing to help keep parts of the mind at ease that are hard to stop from racing. \\n\\nAlso a little bug I think slumber hasn’t been tracking the sessions I do it only says I’ve done 11 when I’ve done way over 60 by now.,I have had this app for several years now to help me sleep and I mostly love it. The large choice of sleep meditations, stories and soundscapes cover most of my sleep assistance needs. I LOVE the custom controls over the background sounds. — Two improvements I would suggest: 1) a more ethnically diverse offering of narrators (no black voices, you folks need to change this now) 2) I would like more control over the music associated with the narrative. I LOVE the piano music but often find the track I choose has a synth drone and I cannot change it. Overall, it is an excellent app.,After we read books, we put on Friendly Dog for our daughters (4 & 2) to listen while they fall asleep. It encourages them to stay in bed, all parents know s struggle.  We tell them they can come out of their room if they are still awake when friendly dog ends (we set it to loop 2x 🤫) but 95% of the time they fall asleep before it ends. \\n\\nWhen I had issues with the app one night, in desperation I pinged their support center and their team helped me sort it out immediately so we could have a peaceful bedtime. Brilliant service!,**UPDATE: I wrote the review below when Slumber was new and free. Then, they changed it to paid. They also changed narrators and some aren’t as good. I quit using it for quite awhile but was desperate recently and tried it again. They added more free stories again and I am again using it more. Now, I don’t feel like they ripped away my slumber I am considering a paid subscription. \\n\\nI am so hooked on Slumber. I need it to fall asleep BUT I don’t need sleep aides or supplements any more. I have tried all the other sleep story and/or music apps and can say without hesitation Slumber is hands down THE BEST. Thank you for this app.,Thank you for making great improvements. I’m sure it’s not easy fixing bugs to constantly stay ahead, but appreciate all you do to help me sleep! Love the stories and meditation and ability to select background ambiance, whether nature or music. The story tellers are all wonderful to fall asleep to. I only wish we could choose the background music. There is one particular background music track that for whatever reason, is sad and frightening. I don’t know how or if it can be changed. Keep the great stories coming. 🙂,I had trouble sleeping due to some trauma that resulted in PTSD. My therapist recommended that I try a sleep app and specifically recommended slumber. I was skeptical. Even now when I play slumber I think, “this is not going to work” and that is the last thing I remember because I fall asleep and sleep through the night. I find that I like falling asleep to a female voice more than a male voice. This app is my favorite because I am able to sleep well and fall sleep within 20 minutes.,I would give them a five star rating just the problem is they locked two of my favorite ones and I’m not gonna spend money on this app so that’s why I give them a three out of five star rating I recommend it if you’re willing to spend money on the app if not all the good stories are locked so I would not get it. But some of their other stories that aren’t locked help me fall asleep so I kind a need this app you may give it a five star rating because you’re willing to spend money on it I am not and I don’t want to.,I’ve never heard the story of the white cat before.  I have been staying awake, not being able to fall asleep because my mind keeps racing.  I decided to try a sleep story because I figured it would help me focus on one thing,  be simple and mindless.  I’ve tried it twice and I still couldn’t tell you what the story is about because I have fallen asleep both times.  I’m excited to go to bed now curious if I will ever finish the story.  I hope not!,When trying to fall asleep after an exhausting day, I’ve struggled to quiet the seemingly never ending thoughts that rotate through my mind. With Slumber, I can choose, depending on my mood, which sleep story or meditation best reflects what I may need that night. It has helped me more than I can say! \\nIn my opinion this app is the best and I have tried many of them, including Calm. If your inner-child is in need of some love, give this a try!,An amazing app.  I have been using this for two months now.  Only once did I ever make it to the end of a story.  Usually I fall asleep during the relaxation instructions before the story even begins. If I waken later in the night and listen again, I am again able to fall asleep. I do have a preference for certain readers.  It is important to listen to several and find ones you like.  My favorite is Thomas Jones.,I started listening 3 or 4 years ago after having Difficulty sleeping due to severe anxiety. I’ve kept buying it every year after that for the entertaining stories and customization options that lull me to sleep. I often recommend it to my patients for the meditations to help with sleep, stress reduction, relieve anxiety, even self affirmations. It’s a good product that seems to continue getting better.,Lots of calming background music and sounds to aid in getting to sleep, as well as good narrators to tell a good story or educate me about an historical event or person.  I also appreciate the numerous relaxation and meditation techniques instructions. Just a great place that I can count on to help me focus on relaxing and escaping to a peaceful place in my mind whether I’m at home or traveling on a plane and staying in hotels on the other side of the country.  Well worth the price :).,Slumber is an amazing app and the stories put me to sleep almost instantly. You can my background noises and those help a lot too. The only reason it’s not five star is because I can only do three or four stories because I must pay for the others. I understand that’s their way of getting money, but I just wish we had another story or two that was free. I recommend slumber! It’s very good at putting you to sleep fast and peacefully.,Ever since I got Slumber (May 2020) I have been listening to their meditations every day. I especially love the one titled \\n“Clouds at Sunset”. I always had trouble sleeping before, but now I never have to worry. The only thing I don’t like is that I have to pay for the other meditations, and it’s not such a big problem but I personally think that all the meditations should be free. So if you are a person who can’t fall asleep at night, I suggest to you to get Slumber.,Good app now. It was terrible for awhile. Lots of selection although for me the history is the best for putting me to sleep. I would however love to rate each episode or selection separately as they vary wildly. Some are great for kids others for history last vets or true meditations. In the setting there is a “rate episode” option but I can never find the ability to do so. Please develop more history options.,I’m a mom of 5 & can have a difficult time falling asleep at night because of the constant to-do list or other thoughts & concerns running through my head once I’m lying in bed. Slumber has been a sleep miracle for me! The narrators’ voices and the adjustable sound effects are so soothing and effective that I’ve never made it to the end of one of the sleep meditations or stories! 😄,I had been so at my wits end not being able to fall asleep and I downloaded the free version of slumber and couldn’t wait to hand them my money bcuz it works like a charm! I have my favorite narrators and stories and I admit I have listened to a story during the day bcuz I wanted to know what happened in the ending!!! Good job you guys... for $4 a month I’m finally falling asleep!,This is an amazing app and it helps me fall asleep with the free slumbers but I know this is how you make money and all but it is kind of annoying that there are not to much free slumbers this is fine but I would really love some new free slumbers they don’t have to be long or good just something a bit new. But other than that this app is beyond my expectations and a great way to fall asleep.,This app is great at helping me relax and fall asleep. I love the variety of modalities (sleep stories, meditations, soundscapes, etc.) as well as the variety of narrators available to choose from. They also continue to add to their library of great content. I love to keep exploring new selections while always being able to revisit old favorites. Thank you for Slumber!,Thank you for this wonderful aid for sleeping. I’ve listened every night for quite a few months and I’ve yet to finish listening to an episode because I always fall asleep before it is over. I particularly love the Story Drones. Makes me feel like a kid again listening to bedtime stories!  Keep up the great work and again THANK YOU!!,I went to put on one of my go to sleep stories and saw it was locked. I tried another, and that one was locked. What the heck? I’m not paying for the app just so I can have my favorite stories, and I don’t understand the point of rotating what stories are and aren’t free, especially the ones that were favorited. I loved this app, but this really puts a damper on it. Now I’m afraid to use any of the stories in case I enjoy them, and then get them taken away again,My favorite stores are the rainy day bakery and California by train \\nAnd the very sleepy duckling my dog even falls into a deep sleep I would honestly download the app and I fall asleep to the stores every night the app helps me stop thinking about my grades for school it helps me stop falling asleep at 1:00 or 4:00 within ten minutes into the stores I fall asleep,I’ve tried many sleep stories and meditation apps similar to this one, but they never work. This app, however, made me fall asleep in 20 minutes! That’s a miracle  considering that it normally takes me hours to fall asleep! Even without premium, there’s so many great stories that I can listen to for free. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who has trouble sleeping.,The reason I rated this a 4 star instead of a five star, is because when I listen to these sleep stories I prefer a female voice, ( because it’s more soothing to me ) but with every sleep story there is only either a male or female narrator option. I think it would be better if you could have a female or a male option for each sleep story. Otherwise, amazing app!!!,I used to never be able to sleep now I put on a story and I am asleep in minutes I know this sounds crazy but it works I absolutely love this app and if it is on infinite replay you never have to turn it back on just plug in your device and you are ready to sleep,This is an amazing app!! Unlike the other app Called Calm, this one has a wide variety of free stories to listen to. Which Is great because I don’t want to have to spend money on An app. The stories on here put me to sleep almost instantly and everything is well organized. I absolutely recommend it and I love it!!!!,i’ve been using slumber for probably 3 years now, and i’ve had the premium subscription the entire time. it is wonderful. i look forward to the end of my day because i get to fall asleep listening to the most peaceful stories and meditations. as soon as i put one on, i feel at peace. at that point in my day, i can remind myself that i have no obligations other than being in this moment. slumber has really helped my anxiety- as soon as i play a story or meditation, i don’t need to worry about anything going on around me, or tomorrow, or the next day. just the moment. i love love love love love this app.,I have been using this app for a little while and have been going on long car trips. I lay down the car seat and turn on one of the story’s or meditations and fall asleep. I would recommend this for anyone! It is amazing and gets me asleep on the ride or in my bed.,I highly recommend this app for individuals with anxiety or problems with sleep. It has the perfect story-telling for adults. This app has helped me many times during my anxiety episodes and triggers. Eternally thankful for this application. Loved it so much I bought the premium! Great investment. Thank you, Slumber Creators!,I have been using this app every night, primarily for the sleep stories, and I do like it. My biggest issues is that I will choose a story and then it just cuts off and stops playing. The background music is still going but the story just stops, sometimes in the middle of a sentence. That is rather distracting when you are trying to fall asleep!,It’s too expensive for the whole thing but they have endless sleep stories. The kids and I really enjoyed using the Free options over and over every night and I thought about unlocking them all and paying but it’s too expensive. Awesome app tho.,If you are having trouble sleeping, look no further. Slumber is simply the best sleep app I’ve used. I rarely make it past the introduction/meditation piece at the beginning of each story. I love that you can add in background sounds and adjust the volume on them. Slumber is worth every penny. Period.,This app may be expensive, but it’s absolutely what I needed. For some reason so many nights and wake up at 3 AM and cannot go back to sleep for at least an hour. Now I know to put on my noise canceling headphones with a sleep story, and I get back to sleep much quicker.,I love this app! It helps distract my racing mind so I can sleep. I love the amount of control you have. I can loop the stories continuously or just have them place once or twice. I  can choose to have a background sound such as rain or leaves. Lots of choices!,I honestly don’t write reviews very often. Last night I started two meditation apps, Canceled one, with a much more familiar name, within the first couple minutes. I absolutely love this app exactly what I was looking for.,so the first thing I saw was that you can pay for it but just like cross it out and continue with the free version and the free version is also amazing so you have sleep stories for free and it does lie a little thing where it tells you like today on slumber. ITS SOOO AMAZING,I started using slumber to get my mind to shut off at bedtime, they have so many listening options. It used to annoy my husband bc he has a hard time falling asleep, now he can’t sleep without it. Abby Opher is my fav. Thomas Jones was my first fav. Upgrade - it’s worth it.,Slumbers relaxing stories and flexibility to play just music after the story make it one of the best! A great selection of story themes, diversity in gender of story tellers, and relaxing music are top notch. I’ve tried many sleep aid apps-and for Slumber is, in my opinion the most effective.,I think I’d be lost without this app. I have one narrator I like best, but there are so many that help, and the soundscapes are always good when I can’t decide on a story or meditation. 5 stars and a huge THANK YOU for saving my sanity and giving me back my night’s rest.,Downloaded the trial and my sleep score (Fitbit) improved immediately!  I fell asleep faster and have had much more deep, restorative sleep.  Normally I prefer silence so I was impressed I could fall asleep listening to the tracks, but it works!,Slumber has helped me get to sleep so many restless nights. Listening to the stories gets me out of my head and gives me something to focus on other than whatever is keeping me up. It works!,It’s a good app but I don’t have to money for the premium and every time I find a thing that helps me sleep it gets locked and can only be listened to  with premium. Could u plzz don’t lock so much stuff?,I went to sleep as a child listening to bedtimes stories on cassette tape. Now I essentially get to do the same thing as an adult. It’s awesome and really powerful! So many different narrators and stories to choose from.,I am a sufferer of getting zero R.E.M. sleep. This app has changed my sleep life. Try the free version, I’m positive you will be sold on buying the app. I had the free app for a few months, then had to get more adult bedtime stories. \\n\\nNot an Ad,OMG.  So many things I love about this app. My favorite narrator is the French Whisperer. I put this app on when I’m ready for bed and 95% of the time I’m out in less than 10 min. Usually 5 minutes. Very relaxing. I love this app!!!!,I used this app on night I couldn’t sleep. I went out like a light and felt well rested the day after. Only thing I would want of the app is cheaper subscription. $40 a year is a little much,I have tried many sleep meditation apps. Slumber has more of a variety of things to use. Weather you just want music or a sleep story, this app has it all!,I really love this app I use it everyday when I try to sleep and it really helps me sleep, I kinda wish they changed the free tracks just a little bit, but I still like this app.,I just started using this app and I love it. My only problem is the long pauses that the narrator uses. When it happens before I get in a deep sleep it triggers my brain to wake up and figure out what’s wrong so it does take a little while to work.,I play the stories at night to fall asleep.   If I wake during the night, the sounds or stories help me fall back to sleep.   I’ve suffered from insomnia for years and this is a great help.,I use Slumber App routinely. Prefer the bedtime stories. Rarely stay awake long enough to hear an entire story! Narrators’ calming, soothing voices enhance state of relaxation. Slumber app has improved bedtime routine allowing for stress reduction & better sleep.,I have tried many apps before but none of the stories seem to draw me to sleep like these ones. Ten out of ten. 100% recommend,They make you pay for some things but it’s not pay to use.,This is hands-down the best sleep app out there. The stories and meditations are wonderful and the narrators’ voices are soothing. I’d recommend Slumber to anyone who wants to add some relaxation to their life, or who needs a little help falling asleep.,This is the best app by far that I have ever used. It helps me fall asleep in the matter of ten minutes! Before this app I could not fall asleep for at least thirty minutes. So I rate the a five star review! 😄😄😄,I can’t sleep without this app. It’s been life changing, as I struggled with falling and staying asleep for a long time. Ever since using this, I’ve never slept better.,I use the app paired with my sleep mask and fall asleep easily and stay asleep all night. This app has everything you can think of and are always adding more.,This app is amazing! The stories are really good and it has more than most other free meditation apps. But I’ve listened to the same stories for awhile now and they are getting less and less effective. I think it would cool if you added a new free story once a month,This is a really good app and sleep in five minutes and all of the other apps you have to pay for stories this one has a lot of free stories 😙😍😍,it was awsome I found one that I didn’t have to have premium and it helps me fall asleep as soon as she starts talking ITS AMAZING I RECOMMEND 100% you did great job just personally bring down the premium price 🤩🤩,You can’t actually mix sounds together like it shows and FYI they give you like 5 stories and sounds to choose from at first but u have to use it for a while to unlock more but that’s what you start out with. Just wanted to let y’all know!:),I have such a hard time staying asleep. I love that you can put the stories on loop and they just play all night long! Best sleep I have ever had!,I enjoy the free stories and I have it low enough to barely here the words but enough to feel relaxed along with my fan on I drown out the world and thoughts.,I really love the sleep hypnosis, it takes a while for me to turn my mind off, so this s really helpful. I put my EarPods in and drift off....,This app offers so many options for sleep and rest requirements. I use it every and it’s works every time. I’m very glad I have it.,I love the story ones, but there are so many great ones. I use the free version but am going to look at the price to upgrade.,My favorite meditation is Gratitude for Sleep.\\nThe author Thomas has the most calming, gentle voice. This 14 minute meditation relaxes my body and puts my mind in a light thankful place while I’m drifting off to sleep.\\n🙏🏻,I love this app! It helps me fall asleep so quickly. I wish they didn’t have a subscription and they just had one quick payment but I guess it’s fine.,I normally struggle to get to sleep. And when i say struggle i mean I don’t go to bed til 2 am. The storys get me asleep in minutes.! I have not tried anything else but I love the story’s,I love this app but i thibk you should be able to mix the sounds like the sleep tones mixed witht the ocean waves other than that i lovve this app i use it almost every night \\n\\nɨ ɦɨɢɦʟʏ ֆʊɢɢɛֆȶ ȶɦɨֆ ǟքք,I use this every night. I like the stories and soundscapes most. Storms are best for me and the recently added Summer storm is really good. Thanks Slumber for helping me sleep again.,I’ve tried so may sleep apps, and I always come back to Slumber!! My absolute favorite and easy to use 😴💖,I’ve been using this app for a while now. Used the same sound every night for 184 sessions and they decided to lock the sound and make me pay for a subscription. Very upset.,For the money, this is by far the best sleep app. The ability to play background sounds during the bedtime stories is awesome. The Calm app cannot do that.,This app is amazing helped with insomnia I had been dealing with for months!! The only reason I put four stars is because it’s a little pricey but other than that amazing!!!,This is the only meditation app if you want good bedtime stories and your own personalized background noise to play along side it. Worth the premium.,I didn’t want to pay a yearly subscription, so I opted for the lifetime membership of $250. And half the items never want to download or play. Set timer and still wake up with it playing hours later. I rather have my money back and opt for a different app. :(,I can’t believe how well this app works. I love the bedtime stories. I don’t think I’ve ever heard the whole story as I’m asleep before it ends.,They have a bunch of genres and perfectly detailed books. I recommend slumber!,I love calm, but Slumber seems to have more stories and mediations for free. I have heart palpitations due to a heart condition and these really do help me settle my heart so I can fall asleep.,That’s perfect I cannot live without it it is the perfect thing for kids and grown-ups I just love it so much my favorite is the white cat,Love the sleep stories. But can barely make it through to see how they end!,more for adults and i have extreme insomnia but i’ve using Slumber for a year and i take it everywhere!,!,,,If you do nothing have this app you are crazy it works wonders thank you slumber,There is a premium option, but there’s also a lot of good stuff that you get for free.

Thank you.,My favorite app. I’ve tried many, this one is perfect and for children too.,Tried and true. Works every night. Even helps me fall back to sleep.,Always helps me get back to sleep at 2 am.  Many wonderful soft voiced narrators and hypnotic music help soothe my awake brain,Yes, the content is good, although I’ve landed on my favorite, so I’m paying monthly for a single meditation.

Great narrators and voices, too.,I usually fall asleep at like 1:00 but using this app has helped me fall asleep at like 10:30.,Plus we are all sleeping better,Best free selection of any sleep app. Very high quality content.

It’s much appreciated! 😄,Whenever is listen to French whisperer I fall asleep so fast!,It’s Always  my\\nFavorite! Now that they sleep tones and even better,3 times in the night I tried to listen. Fell asleep every time. Great app!,This app made me fall asleep within the first story I heard,I love it so much I can’t stop listening to it,I cannot turn the app off. I have tried everything but  I’ll be driving down the road and it hooks up to blue tooth and starts playing on stereo system. Zero support from customer service,This is the best step I ever downloaded it helps me fall asleep all the time:),This is a fabulous journey through gratitude to sleep, rest and peace.  So comforting and stress dissolving.,I can not get this to work. I have written to the company and they won’t write back. I have paid for this app and it’s worthless! Total rip off! I wish I could give this zero stars.,Sleep till 750 well I just did How does maze,I love it,So I was doing this for a week now right? So what happened was I clicked on something and my avast app said there was a malicious website everytime I clicked it and so I deleted it because it was a virus so don’t download it.,It works really well and I love it makes me repay clam,I’ve just tried the free samples and the stories and narration are OK.

Worthless.,I use it every night, love it!,I had one favorite story that always put me to sleep that I used for two years, now all of the sudden I have to pay for it. I don’t agree.,This is a really good app to make me sleep!,Especially like Catherine Jackson and Elizabeth Grace! Thanks for your helpful app!!,The app is amazing very calming. I fell asleep in the middle off the story.,I had this app till it started kicking me out and acting up my phone but other than that it’s good,The best app for sleep. I love combination of music or meditation with nature sounds!,Best sleeping app ever,Fall asleep every time,This has made it so I can fall asleep...Great app,Good but I want more mediations and less story’s,Edit: Editing this review because, while I appreciate that they actually have been adding new free stories like I suggested, they have locked previously free ones. My all time favorite was the Birds of Yosemite. Great narrator, beautiful musings about nature, and it is now locked. Previously permanent free stories should be grandfathered in, even if new free ones since the change are on a rotating basis (idk if they are but i cant think of why else they would lock old free ones). Dreams of Grasmere is also locked now and that one was also pretty successful at helping me sleep. Sidenote, I just checked the premium price and its now $40/yr, which is not as ridiculous a price as it was before\\n\\n- - -\\nThis app is fantastic, the stories help my brain focus on the narrative rather than a bunch of inner chaotic thoughts, which helps me fall asleep. I especially love The Birds of Yosemite, which seems to be a reading of an actual published journal of some sort. And it has such rich and beautiful descriptions and the narrator does a wonderful job. The optional sound effects & mixing are also very subtle & pleasant. HOWEVER I have to knock my review down a whole two stars because there is such a small handful of free episodes. Only someone with a superfluous amount of spending money would pay $10/mo for a single sleep app, as much as it may help their (my) chronic insomnia. I would love to fall asleep to more nature journals, or more simple stories like The Cats Journey, but there has not been a single new free episode in the months I’ve had this app. And the problem with listening to the same stories over and over is that your brain starts to tune them out because they are familiar, and instead becomes overrun with thoughts once again and stays awake. If the devs would consider at least releasing ONE new free story for every 5 or 10 new locked stories (new locked stories get released at an impressive rate), I would easily give the app 5 stars.,You have to pay to get the main meditations,This app helps me sleep,This is a very good app for meditation and relaxation.,AMAZING,And falling asleep,I fell asleep in minutes. It is amazing.,I love this app.,i love it,Initially encouraged, but content hasn’t changed in several months. #buyer’s remorse,I really tried,This, now, this, is crossing the line. These stories and background noises and completely unreal! I love the attention to detail in each and every one of these books. So far, my two favorites are The White Cat and The Sleepy Caterpillar. My little brother LOVED The Sleepy Caterpillar, and fell asleep almost instantly after his beloved bedtime story. I personally like The White Cat the best. The daring story of a princess journeying to a Cat Kingdom, befriending cats of all kinds, and a great rescue kept me awake all the way through it, but I did eventually fall asleep. I am a very rough sleeper. I’m terrible at falling asleep, and sometimes it takes hours. This has put me asleep so quickly, and this is only my first day using it! Me and my family are about to go on a LONG trip to California, and I will definitely listen to these stories while on the road. It’s strange, but road noises seem to soothe me...\\n\\nDear Abbe Opher,\\nHello! I am 10 years old, and I really like your The White Cat story. I am super excited to hear your other stories, and I’d like to say, your voice is very soothing! Keep up your great work. ✌🏻🥳🌟.    Sincerely, Catelyn Calvert in Texas\\n\\nDear Nadine Brown,\\nHello! I am 10 years old, and I love your The Sleepy Caterpillar story! It put my brother to sleep, and I don’t think he’s waking up anytime soon. The serenity of being a caterpillar sounds so soothing and nice; the chocolate acorns, bird siblings, and the sleepy cocoon. It makes me think of what it REALLY would be like. Your story was the first story I heard on this app, and I thank, thank, thank you for getting my brother to sleep. He’s a little ball of energy and won’t stop talking.   Sincerely, Catelyn Calvert in Texas\\n\\nThank you so, so, so, much for this amazing app. But for now, I am going to fall asleep to a beautiful story about a princess and a white cat...,I’m 7 bruh and I don’t have premium anymore 😭 pls make more free kid stories,Thanks,Very good,$40 just to try it t out - NOT,B e a utiful,Bestt🇮🇷,So last night I had insomnia because I was excited for today.OK good nights sleep at all no matter what I tried until I got this app. I tried listening to music that’s relaxing. It didn’t work. I tried listening to Calm stories and let me get this straight there are little comb stories for free. But on Slumber there are a lot of free stories that you can listen to. I listened to the California train story and it helped so much I fell asleep in just a matter of minutes. You should download this app right now it is so great.🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🙂🙂😌😌😌😌😌😌😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊😊😊😊☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️,I’ve struggled with sleep problems for many years due to tinnitus in both ears. Prescription meds, over the counter meds, alcohol. You name it and I’ve tried it. To help with the tinnitus I wear hearing aids 24/7-365 and have the ability to stream using blue tooth technology. I came across the Slumber App and took advantage of the 7 day free trial period and instantly noticed a HUGE difference. I am now in my second month and am as excited now as I was the first week…. This program is a game changer for me. Getting to sleep is now a joyful experience and with the ability to set the App to play one, two, or more times if I wake up during the night I’m lulled right back to sleep.,I like history asmr type stories for sleep, or guided meditations, but it’s hard to find them with rain in the background on YouTube. With slumber you can add whatever background noises you want!!! I’m very happy to have found this, because now I can find a good meditation or bedtime story and then add my own background rain. Thanks to French Whisperer for mentioning it on his channel.,This app is awwwwwwesome,I was pinged to renew my annual subscription and decided against it. I’ve had Pzizz for almost 12-months. The stories are interesting and I enjoy the majority I have heard. However the “music” selection one can choose to pair with the story is often macabre sounding to me. Not all of it, but I find it to be monotone, synthetic random sounds. Hard for me to explain but If there were soft instrumental music and / or a selection of nature noises w/ music to add to keep playing after the story, I would have renewed. There are other sleep apps which offer this, and are actually less expensive. They also offer endless stories…I hope you consider this in the future for those who prefer different “music”.,No other app can make me fall asleep quite as fast as Pzizz. I usually lay awake at night for hours on end unable to sleep but I am out usually within minutes every time I use Pzizz. I am so happy to finally have found something that works for me and I can’t wait to tell all my friends so maybe they can finally start getting some sleep!!,Was a traveling consultant that needed something to help me sleep and found this on the App Store. I genuinely use this every night. I’m out within 20 mins maximum. This is one of the few apps I actually pay for (because who has money to pay for a bunch of apps?),I have a pro subscription on my iPhone and bought a Samsung tablet and couldn’t get the Pro registered there. Their customer support was superb. Their ‘normal’ steps didn’t work so Zac got the developers involved and they soon had it resolved. Response was always same or next day. Refreshing!,I have used Pzizz literally since it would generate an mp3 that I could copy on to an iPod. So incredibly helpful - with limited sleep, frequent interruptions - even the general deterioration in ones sleep cycle as we age - this has been a lifesaver.,I have used Pzizz for many years. It is a the key to my power naps and I would not be able to recharge with out the great nap function. If you have trouble relaxing and falling asleep I would totally recommend you try Pzizz!,This is the best sleeping app that I have ever used it makes me fall asleep within minutes. Just listening to the sweet and smooth voice with the exceptional and unique background music is the best combination ever.,This app is aaaammaaaaziiiinnnng!!!! It really makes a difference when you have crackhead energy at 11 and have to be up early in the morning! Very much recommend!,Often the narrative is the same every night.  I’m used to it, but would like something different every night.,This is the best app. I use it everyday... every single day.\\nI can’t live without it as it helps me tremendously with my tinnitus and anxiety at bed time.❤️❤️❤️,Just saw they don’t collect data. Perfect to support.,How about a “try before buy” option?,I set a two hour nap, one hour in: bong bong bong. Maybe it’s just the Breathe soundscape, but it never lets me rest for more than an hour. Really frustrating.,The dings, tings and bells jerk me out of sleep during my naps. Wish I could turn them off.,It’s so soothing to hear right before falling asleep!,I literally started laughing out loud next to my (very asleep) partner in bed when I heard the guided audio. This is so bizarre?? It sounds like she is straight up reading a Wikipedia article, not AT ALL as advertised. Strange.,No Ads!!!,Have used this for years every night after discovering a snippet of the classic pzizz on YouTube. All of the added features are nice but I never use them. I understand the desire to improve things but PLEASE never get rid of the classic pzizz narration! Love y’all!,Why not just make a app to help people?Why do you have to pay for it.I love the app but I can’t afford it.if you want people to like it make it free.,It’s almost embarrassing to say this, but I have been a “meditator” for about 30 years and I have to say that I never really got very much out of doing it.  I tried so hard, but I’m finding out I never truly understood that “trying” to be a good meditator or mindful person, was missing what doing this was about.  What I’m learning through this app is that “mindfulness” is about me - understanding myself first, and it’s a lot about acceptance.  So with that understanding and acceptance I can begin to see “things” so much more clearly and why previous ways of thinking, particularly about myself, were holding me back from living my life and loving myself.  And I’m finding that the more I practice self acceptance, the fears about living fully and going after what I want out of my life, are disappearing.  \\nThe previous version of myself is rapidly becoming someone I only used to know, and this new ME is much more in line with who I’d always wanted to be.  I’m able to try and do so much more, all while in the comfort that I am lovable, even if I fail at something.  I simply dust myself off and try some more.\\nThis app has completely changed me and the way I’m able to appreciate all the good that’s in my life.  And I’m worthy of going after the things I want for my life, while freeing me up to share my gifts with others and society in general.\\nIf this is where you find your life stalling out, this app will bring you back to yourself.,I discovered Headspace on Netflix. My life is a series of invitations to succumb to fear. My husband is a practicing psychologist who is on peritoneal dialysis for 10 hours every night and works remotely with patients for about 10 hours every day without complaint. We have been waiting for a kidney for two years. I am optimistic by nature but even if this was the only focus for concern it would be a lot. Unhelpfully, the list goes on with equivalent issues. I can’t work; I need to be on call because I am the go-to for support. I occupy my mind and time writing a book and renovating every room of our home one at a time amidst being available for nine blended (mostly grown) children and 5 grandkids, many of whom have special needs. I am busy but isolated like so many due to covid-19. Trying the Headspace series felt like meeting air; filling the natural and effortless need to breathe. It has provided me with a new lens through which to focus on challenges and see potential. I incorporate it into my waking routine at dawn and it positions me for whatever happens throughout the day, and differentiates a space that is my own. I turn 61 this month and for maybe the first time in a while, life feels lighter and brighter. It’s not about what you fear or can’t control or even the fact of fear. It’s about the lens through which you interpret your fears or challenges and making them your strengths and allies. Thank you Andy :-),You won’t regret buying a Headspace subscription. I often joke with people that Headspace is the one thing I would want to take with me to a desert island. If I were to cancel all of my subscriptions today, Headspace is the one exception I would make. I’m a high school English teacher, and our administration put together a month-long mindfulness education program for our students shortly after I subscribed. I had already raved to many of them about the app and the benefits of taking a couple of minutes out of their day to sit and be present. Lo and behold, Andy pops up on the next slide as our Ted Talk speaker of the day! On a more serious note, I suffer from debilitating chronic pain. I’m currently on long-term disability and a leave of absence from the classroom. Mindfulness, and the courses on managing pain, have been a tremendous help in my journey. Not only that, but I struggle with insomnia. My favorite part of Headspace, because of my (admittedly) vivid imagination, are the sleepcasts. I love falling asleep to Rainday Antiques. I can’t imagine doing anything but that ever again. I have learned to manage stress and anxiety in a way that I had never thought was possible. I have meditated in the waiting room of The Cleveland Clinic before my appointments. I once laughed at the idea of mindfulness and meditation. Now it’s an integral part of my life. It’s part of my journey, and I think everyone could benefit from it.,This app has given me tools to deal with constant change. This past year, I’ve needed to pivot every day to face some new challenge outside as an essential worker, and at home in isolation with my partner. The tools I Iearned to use to be present in the moment and to accept change has benefited my partner and colleagues at work as much as my own peace of mind. I have very little control over my environment, but I can see my reaction, accept the emotions that rise up, and move on instead of getting lost or bound by them.\\nThis app has also benefited me by helping me get through insomnia. Sometimes it helps me get to sleep in the first place. Mostly it gives me tools to use to calm my mind and body when I wake up in the night buffeted by anxiety or lingering frustration from the day. \\nLastly, this app has given me a language to express the emotional upheaval and troubling questions that I used to just call anxiety. Naming what makes me feel upset has brought clarity to what can feel like a tempest at the time and allow me to look at my thoughts or, rather, face them. After acknowledging them, I can let them go. Sometimes I’m better at that than at other times. \\nRegular exercise strengthens my focus, my ability to pivot and refocus, and builds roads of calm and quiet that the brain finds easier to fall into and travel due to constant use.,This app has helped me so much! When I am suffering from stress, health anxiety, or fibro/stress related body pains I turn to this app and go through some meditations with the teachers. It’s an excellent way for me to relax. Calm my mind. Stop thinking about myself. And to recover in the moment. Hopefully in time this will help me heal, as previously I’ve just been getting worse and worse without any therapy since my therapist’s practice permanently shutdown from COVID. This has been a great help and is something I can just pull out of my pocket and sit in my bedroom for a bit to calm down. Well worth the 1 year subscription price I’ve paid. Thank you! 😊🙏🏻\\n\\n*There is only one thing that I’d change. This would be for some of the workout audios. I need to walk a lot for a heart condition I have (which is a big cause of my health anxiety), and I’d love to see the audios for walks and runs to be a bit longer. The longest run audio I see is 20 minutes, when recommended cardio workout lengths realistically should be at least 30 minutes. I’d really like to have an audio similar to the bedtime audios that are lengthy, have soothing talk, and tips to reduce anxiety made to be listened while walking. And if there could be a variety to choose from. Overall this would be the only change I can think of. An hour long walk audio to help calm my mind. 😁❤️,I freaking love this app. My anxiety was starting to become bad again and I could feel myself falling into depression. I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness and it’s helped me in the past but I’ve never been able to stick with it for more than a couple of weeks at a time. Then one day while listening to Huberman’s podcast there was a month free trial and I decided to try it since I’ve always wanted to give this app a go anyway. WELL, let me tell you...this app is changing my life. I am proud to say I am on my 33rd day streak. I can feel myself overall being more present and aware throughout the day. Now, when I start to feel anxious I almost immediately catch myself and can begin using some of the tools and practice I’ve accumulated from headspace. I do want to add though, the key word is PRACTICE. Medication, like Andy says, is a skill and like any skill you must practice. By practicing enough, it does truly become second nature. I know it’s only been a month but I can already feel the difference and I am looking forward to the future. Thank you headspace team. P.S every little thing about this app is great. I especially love the different courses, the wake ups, the animation shorts, the sleepcasts, the focus music and yoga.,I heard about this app on tv and saw ads in The Today section of the App Store. I decided to give it a try and it really does help me out. I feel less stressed, calm, and feel ready for anything. It’s like a guide or tool which helps push you to be a better you. So then comes the question, is it worth it? I think so. For instance if you have ADHD or feel stressed most days (maybe because of work or school) use this. \\n\\nEverything is not sunshine and rainbows. For one, $13 to me feels somewhat pricey. Other meditation apps that I found are cheaper than what Headspace currently offers. Another thing is that it lacks free content. There’s only very little that Headspace offers and it’s not a lot. It’s almost as if your forced into paying for a subscription in order to use it. I really didn’t want to do that and I have now canceled it since I felt that it was overly priced. \\n\\nHeadspace is great and I may say that’s is better than most apps I’ve used. But I don’t like the fact that after going through the tutorial it locks most of the content Headspace offers you and forces you into a subscription that feels overly priced. Yeah, they give you a free trial but after that your pretty much forced. Offer more videos that are free and let people decide for themselves. If you do those things I may bump my stars to 5.,So I’ve been using headspace for quite awhile now and personally I think it’s great! But the thing is since I don’t have premium, I have to keep on repeating the same old things like the rain day antiques sleepcast I’ve heard that sleep cast so many times and now I keep getting annoyed with it. That goes the same with the other sleep stuff too like the sleep music I’ve heard “doze” so many times I wake up like every 30 minutes or so. Also goes the same with the two free wind downs. The first time I used the free wind downs I fell asleep instantly the second time after that I couldn’t sleep for ten minutes. So after that, I wanted to do a free trial for the premium but I didn’t realize I was short on money. Since most people do a free trial for like a week or so they cancel there payment the day before the payment is due. So I tried doing that but it asked for but then I realized they need to know my payment information before doing my free trial. I think it was because they don’t know if I’m gonna cancel my payment or actually do the payment. So yeah, I think this app is amazing it just needs to either lower down the price by like 3-4$ or maybe add one or two me free sleepcasts and same goes to the wind downs, and music. Thank You.,This is really helpful! The only reason I didn’t give a higher rating is because there’s a strong overlying tone of a sales pitch there. Which is unfortunate, because I think people would be able to see the value easier if there wasn’t a push for money after every meditation and for many of the things on the app people would want to explore. Kind of stalls progress of the meditation itself when you’ve just worked so hard to pull yourself back, only to be instantly asked for money right after. From a company stand point I also think it would be more beneficial to work on building value and then freely offering the option to see what monthly costs are and also show a detailed description of what’s involved with a paid membership. I know this has worked well financially for other services and I’ve seen increases in sales by simply looking at things from the customers perspective. And I feel like the customers perspective is a miss here :(\\nHowever quite and easy fix and overall this app is amazing! It not only teaches the basics of meditation, but teaches different techniques as well. This makes it good for beginners all the way to experts. I truly believe that the basis of this app is pure in intention and I can see what a help it is to many people who walk the path of life.,This app has been somewhat of a life saver for me. I’ve experienced a lot of trauma during my life, and a few years ago I came across this app or it came across to me via Instagram. I travel quite a bit and I love that I’m able to pick my environment of choice to meditate. I always thought meditation meant quieting your thoughts etc... but when I learned that it was part of being mindfulness and being present in the now it helped immensely in my day to day well being. When I did the anxiety course that really helped in so many ways because I thought you could get rid of it. But learning to become aware of it and being present with it, I felt it wasn’t so much of a burden. I’ve had trouble on and off sticking to it consistently but I’m trying it again. It’s nice to be able to have it there especially when I know how much of a positive impact it has had on my life. I am a parent and it’s something I want my child to learn and partake in so she has the necessary tools through out her early years to when she is grown up. This is worth every penny to maintain a healthy mindset and wellbeing. You’ll view the world and stress differently than you did before.,I downloaded Headspace when it was free for health care workers in 2020. I was pregnant at the time and was under a lot of stress at my job. I started with the pregnancy course on the app. This was so amazing. First of all, Andy’s voice is incredibly calming. Then the pregnancy meditation helped me feel closer to baby. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and when I was less stressed, my glucose was lower. This app helped me a ton with that. Then, when I went to my 29 week check up, I had just read a work email I was very upset about. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was high. They sent me to the hospital for monitoring. While I was there I practiced the meditation I had learned and was able to get my blood pressure down so I could go home! The meditations also helped me get through labor! Now that I had my baby, I’m still using this app because it just helps me find calm in my crazy world of being and full time working mom during a pandemic. If you are at all interested in meditation, you need this app. I promise it’s worth the money. When my free subscription is over, I’m paying for it! I never write app reviews, but I just want everyone to know how great Headspace truly is.,In my abnormal psychology class we learned anxiety is not just a fight or flight response but instead can be a future oriented response. Abnormal anxiety usually is characterized by presenting when there is no real danger. Therefore when I lay down in bed to sleep and I start getting an increase heart rate, feel extremely hot and sometimes nauseous at the idea of future situations and work that I have yet to do, it’s abnormal. Even if many people experience this is is abnormal because there is no real threat just my brain over thinking future situations. Therefore on my quest to look for ways to relax my mind before bed I downloaded headspace. I usually listen to a guided meditation before bed. Followed I will set one of their sleep music for 60 minutes and lay down. I now am normally asleep before the sleep music stops. Even though in my class we talked more about biological and psychological treatments, I felt as though there might be an easier way for me to deal with this anxiety. Headspace has created a way for me to clear my head before bed allowing for more and a greater quality of sleep. I would suggest this app to anyone, not even for just sleeping. But as a way it relax.,I give this app 5 stars because the build of this app, the contents of this app, the flow of this app is great. well done. Every app can be improved and this one needs work in some ways 1. the watch app: the only thing I every get on the watch app is a 1 minute \"breath mini\". the watch app is basically useless. Why can\\'t I see my today screen on the watch and start my various mediations from the watch. the watch app gets 1 star. 2. Shortcuts: on the iphone I have setup a sleep schedule. On the \"good night\" screen I am given the option to run shortcuts. Headspace offers a few shortcuts that can be called from this screen. One is the nightly \"sleepcast\". the sleepcast is supposzed to be different every night. It is different on my today screen, but the shortcut always plays the \"Rainyday Antiques\". therefore the shortcut is useless. this part of the app gets 1 star. Lastly, the philosophy behind this app is mindlessness. It is taught as a universal fix for bringing the mind to a place of ease. As such it is a religious philosophy. I think they need to be more open about this and they need to state that the point of this is to alleviate suffering.\\n\\nThis app looks like they did version 1 then stopped before finishing the details.    Shortcuts must work for this app to be fully functional,I signed up for my free trial in fall 2019, at the recommendation of a family member. I thought it was great, but wanted to shop around and see what all of the individual meditation apps had to offer, but Headspace is the clear winner. I signed up for an annual subscription (and I hardly ever do that). The general organization of the interface is great in its simplicity, because you can easily toggle between the app’s different features with the navigation on the bottom, and there’s only five options so it’s aesthetically pleasing to me. Speaking of aesthetics, the graphics shown while meditating are very uplifting, simple, and non-intimidating. I think apps like Calm that have the ability to show/do nature sounds are cool, but that feels like too many decisions as to what graphic to choose. The soft Australian accent that Andy has is very calming but feels more non-judgmental, like an old friend who’s just being your guide through the meditation. The daily video content pieces are cool, too. So far I’ve learned about how music affects the brain and about snake plants. This app leaves me feeling inspired and refreshed. 10/10. Great job, devs!,I use this app exclusively for the sleepcasts, so that’s the only feature I can comment on.\\nI love them, and they’re the only way I can fall asleep now. I wish they were a bit longer, but I understand it’d be hard to record a story that’s hours long. I have a couple suggestions: When a sleepcast ends, can it just skip to the next sleepcast (or at least have that be an option in settings?). Also, I can only fall asleep to male voices, so I’m very limited to a few sleepcasts.. it’d be great if all stories were recorded by both a male and a female and we could choose which we’d like to listen to. Lastly, I really would like a setting where we can skip the breathing wind-downs. If not, then at least have a trigger where when you’ve already done 1 wind-down, then the next sleepcast you listen to should automatically skip this part. It’s frustrating wanting to dive right into a new story and having to go through the same breathing session you just did. I really hope you hear my input and take it into consideration! If not, I’ll send them via email to developers. :),There are many tools available to help anyone who puts their mind to easing and alleviating their mind of a bunch of “small stuff”. Headspace is one of those tools. Andy, or any of the two female instructors, do an awesome job in guiding you through the meditation process. There are a variety of topics: Happiness, Anxiety Management, Anger Management, and so on, which are featured as courses, ranging from 10-30 sessions, each one being as short as 10 minutes or up to 20. The teachers start each session talking about a certain aspect, a thinking pattern, that applies to the topic in question, which lasts about one to two minutes, as a means of providing a tangible mental visualization to accompany you in the session as it begins.\\n\\nAside from these courses, the app features exploring meditation fundamentals such as breathing, visualization, and so on. Q and A sessions, “Start the day” routines, this app is really, really good. If you want to experience a more guided meditation as opposed to only music accompaniment as featured in “Calm”, give “Headspace” a try. You will not be disappointed!,I have been using the Headspace app for about 5 years now.  From the very beginning I felt I was embarking on a magical journey - a journey that would teach me the tools I needed to lift myself out of feelings of constant fear and inadequacy.  Tools that would help me open my heart and mind to new possibilities and a more peaceful and compassionate approach to myself and the world. With the gentle and insightful guidance of Andy and the other practitioners, I feel safe and supported in my efforts to face and walk through difficult times.  I am able to embrace joy and be present for myself, others and my life as it is today.   It is always going to be a daily practice, as it should be, for that is the essence of being in the moment.  I am also thrilled at how Headspace has evolved to include so many different guided topics for meditation as well as adding exercise to the program!  What better way to integrate mind and body.  Thank you all for what you have done to create Headspace and allow it to thrive!  In gratitude,  Pamela Llewellyn,personally, i love this app. the meditations are really helpful for my crippling anxiety, and i thoroughly enjoy watching the daily videos and doing the mindfulness moments. i also really like the new updated version with the dark mode and everything. however, i’m not as happy with headspace as i thought i would be when i got the app. i’m still a kid, and i’m not going to spend money to get headspace+, so i’ve had the normal version, however i’m very disappointed about the lack of content i have unlocked. i can only do a few meditations and they’re limited. this is very upsetting to me, and i’ve heard that others have felt the same way. i’m considering deleting headspace for exactly this reason: there’s not enough free content. soon enough i will run out of meditation sessions. i am not satisfied with this app. PLEASE unlock more content for those who don’t want or CANT spend money on headspace+!!!! you might lose this costumer to your app for just that reason. i need more content because my anxiety lately has been through the roof, so i would be excited to try out some new meditations but i CANT. please fix this!!!!!,Have been using this app for years, since 2017. It has completely changed the way I manage my anxiety. Not only do they have a course for anxiety, but there are also SOS meditations that are super helpful when you’re in the middle of panic mode. Since I first got the app they have added so many new meditations, courses, and even instructors. It has grown with me as my meditation practice has grown and it is always a great day when I use the Headspace app. \\nAs far as the price it is definitely on the expensive side. I first started using the app when I was in college and was lucky to be in a financial situation where I could afford it. I know they are offering it for free to those who have been affected by the coronavirus. However, my one critique is that they should make a student version, so more people will have access to this life-changing app. \\nThank you Headspace for this amazing product! I will continue to be a customer for many more years, I am sure.,Not every technique works equally well for everyone, and I feel like they put an over emphasis on the body scan (which is admittedly one I’m not particularly fond of). They have courses like “dealing with anxiety” or “managing anger”, but they’re all essentially the same: “here’s some basic advice you’ll get from every therapist for 30 seconds, now let’s do 20 minutes of body scan.” I don’t feel like they really apply the meditation to the issues often enough, but the advice is decent.\\n\\nAlso, in the beginners courses they mention a lot of abstract concepts that are supposed to help you but they don’t explain them very well or reinforce them very often. So half the time I find myself thinking “Wait, what does he mean by that again and how was I supposed go about it?” \\n\\nThere are enough great meditation pointers though that it’s been super helpful to get over some hurdles I was struggling with and the voices are very relaxing. Unfortunately the content is a bit sparse given how much stuff they have posted and it can be difficult finding the gems when there’s so much filler to wade through.,Where do I start? This has changed my life in the best way I can ever imagine! I deal with a lot and i mean a lot (depression, anxiety, stress, etc & the year 2020). I was in such an uncomfortable place with myself  like i wasnt happy with myself, and i was my worst enemy and then I found Headspace on Netflix and I thought why not. I was never good with mediation I’ve tried it before and I thought it was a waste of my time, but wow was i wrong with this. It’s so much different and then i found the app and everyday i mediate! I’ve been working on my anger, my depression, focusing on me. Being kind to me and I’m telling you this has helped me so much. Each recording is about 10 - 15 minutes and Andy walks you through the mediation, helps you to focus on what you need to take care of yourself. \\nIf you’re having trouble with yourself or feeling like things dont go your way, please try this. Honestly I haven’t had a day where I’m feeling uncomfortable with myself or feeling depressed. It’s worth it,I’m still fairly young, 24 years old, but in my life so far I’ve acquired a lot of emotional stress. Clinical anxiety and depression, mostly stemming from trauma. But also just becoming aware of aging and time. Cosmologically feeling small and insignificant, that life is pointless. Existential anxiety has seemed to take hold of my mind every day, exacerbating the anxiety and depression I already suffer from. \\n\\nThis app is something I’m truly grateful for. (Along with the series they recently added on Netflix!) More than aware there’s no cure or abolition of negative thoughts and feelings in their entirety. Realizing it’s all part of the human condition and important to learn how to be aware and navigate stress. Headspace is easy to use and perfectly introduces meditation to people like me who never thought they needed it. Especially when it comes to attention/focus, the guided meditation is exceptional. The interface is clean and smoothly designed. I can’t recommend this enough!,I have dabbled in self-guided meditation before downloading Headspace, and having this app has been a game changer in so many different parts of my life. I fall asleep faster by listening to the sleepcasts religiously every night. I focus better at work using the brilliantly realistic nature soundscapes (I find other soundscapes overly dramatic and more distracting than soothing, but these are perfect). I listen to focus playlists when I walk my dogs. Since one of my dogs has leash aggression, our walks used to be stressful, frustrating, and an activity I dreaded. Now, I do a walking meditation the whole time and things go so much better. My dog still freaks out at other dogs, but I’m much better at remaining calm and redirecting him. I love the wide variety of things Headspace has to offer. It all fits so seamlessly into every kind of activity I do. It is worth every penny. Thank you, Headspace, for making such an incredible and accessible meditation app.,Quality: The app never glitches, the content is bountiful and inspires curiosity of oneself and the world around. I’ve had this app for over a year now. It is the only yearly subscription worthy of my money from the App Store. I’m glad I had this when COVID hit. \\n\\nBenefit: These meditation courses and singles have been a life saver for my gifted 10yr old daughter working through PTSD in therapy from trauma. Through the kid section she has learned how to use her breath, and at night, calming sounds or stories to help keep her brain wandering into negative places. She has even worked her way through the grieving courses to help her cope with COVID closing our schools. Her understanding of coping skill usage has increased exponentially and has learned awareness of her feelings in her body.\\n\\nBut, I too have benefited. Without this training, I would have a hard time helping my daughter. Aside from that, the app has reminded me about how to be my creative self again. From gently progressing meditation courses to the video and clever animation shorts that help you to understand foundational concepts, I am feeling enjoyment in my life no matter where I am or what is happening. My favorite treat is the morning wake up video shorts. They range from the wonders of nature to affirming financial struggles. The saguaro cactus video has been my favorite. \\n\\nHeadspace team, can the app have access to the library of these morning video shorts?,I use it basically all day every day. I love the sleep casts and sleep music in the background when I’m wrapping up my day, and the soundscapes really help with my insomnia. In the mornings I put on some focus music while I attend my online university classes. If I have time in a day I pull out my yoga mat and put on a stretching walkthrough,  a specialized yoga form, or a guided meditation. It really helps me feel more in control of my thoughts and feelings, and I love that it’s such an easy and simple way to encourage me to move my body when I’m stuck at home. Even when I’m having a bad day, Headspace is my go to. I’ve worked through a lot of pent up emotions and automatic negative thoughts with guided meditations, and with the daily meditations I learn a new strategy or life tip every day. This app is basically the little steady calm in the insanity of my busy days. Whether I’m starting my day or ending it, Headspace is the app I’m on. I highly recommend!,Headspace is so much more than an App on my phone. Life feels crazy busy. Uncertainty seems to have been a stronger presence for everyone these days. Headspace is part of my daily practice. I am so glad I was introduced to it and have stuck with it for over a year now. Only missed a couple of days in a year. I find it easy to include one or more headspace sessions into a day. If I haven’t done one and it comes towards end of day, I want to get it in. I now understand it’s the building impact. A single session is helpful, but over time I have really noticed the difference and the impact on how I approach each day, each situation. Yes, being aware, being mindful and it has helped me to be more at peace with the ups and downs. More able to enjoy all the good and the bad has less impact. It used to be the other way round. \\nThanks to the team at Headspace, for providing me with some head space each day.,I am having my COVID shot the next day and REALLY wanted to have a nice sleep before that. I took one meditation session before going to bed in headspace. As usual, it worked nicely BUT when I reached to my phone to close the app, a pop up message showed up saying “Can’t sleep? Try our new sleepcast” it immediately triggered my anxiety of afraid of losing sleep, and I wasn’t able to sleep that night and had to cancel my COVID shot appointment. \\nThis is really disappointing from a meditation app as this kind of message can easily trigger someone who’s already anxious (and those are often the users of headspace). Especially this is an in-app pop up that you cannot disable in the iOS system setting. \\nI am not sure why this message will show up at that time and I don’t want to assume bad intentions (after all Headspace had helped me quite a lot and I am thankful). Please stop sending these kinds of anxiety-triggering messages or at least allow us to disable them!\\n\\nFrom a 5-year customer.,So when I first started headspace I didn’t know if this app was for me but when I looked more into it the ratings were really good so I downloaded it and first I did meditation 🧘\\u200d♀️ it was my first time and meditation helped me clear my head the I tried sleep noises and that was great it helped me fall asleep faster and usually I have trouble sleeping also meditation can also help you sleep and every thing else was a 5 out of 5 in my opinion and meditation the sleep noises it was all really good  and this kept popping up it said rate this app and write a review so the first couple of times I ignored it but then since the app was really good I decided to write a review and rate it and I gave it five out of five so I highly recommend this app for every one ☝️ and I even recommend for the kids who would like to do headspace and have trouble calming down so this is my review I hope you like this app as much as I  do🙃🤗👍,I have been battling a lot of anxiety and depression and this is a tool I use to help counteract my feelings of feeling  alone.  It’s not a get rid of everything that is stressing you out promise, rather it’s a tool to use that gives you an advantage. It helps with the process of grief and with feelings of unease, doesn’t get rid of them, but helps make them manageable.  I meditate daily now. If I can I try to find at least 10 min, but there are shorter 1-3 minutes for those who are completely stressed out with little time to make.  It’s a really good tool and I am glad I am using it.  It’s definitely worth the subscription. I recommend for all, no matter what is happening.  This app will help if you use it correctly with the right expectations. There is no cure-all, but this is a tool that will help you reach points where you feel happier and feel less of what you feel now.,I have been a Headspace user for several years now. I first found it back in 2016 after I graduated from college, but I could only periodically afford to keep the app as expenses have always been a challenge in my life. However, I always came back. Headspace has provided me with the resources and support I needed from a community. The approach to everyday practice is made so simple that I would practice on my own throughout the day. Practicing meditation has helped me in countless ways, of the most significant is with depression (MDD). Alongside my therapy sessions, I would practice meditation, I cannot put into words how this has transformed my relationship with my thoughts and people around me. Yesterday, everyday was a hard and difficult day. Today, everyday is beautiful and the challenges are welcome. I love you headspace, thank you again for your support and the light you pour into the world.,From socially anxious and feeling that a part of myself was lost to overcoming my self deprecating mindset and finally loving myself, headspace has been my guide through it all. No therapist, self medication/prescriptions, has been able to help me the way that mindfulness meditation has. I cried when my free trial was finished and I continue to buy headspace annually since 2017. I am eternally grateful for this application, it has sincerely been a beacon of hope for me from the beginning. I’ve seen it grow so much in popularity and for good reason, it is the easiest way to learn how to meditate. I couldn’t have done it without you, Andy. I hold a very special place in my heart for you. Self development, spirituality and love is my main focus in this life thanks to this newfound way of dealing with my neurosis that I have been blessed to have given the opportunity to grow from. 🥺♥️🧠\\U0001fac0\\U0001fac1 🧘🏽\\u200d♀️🏵,I love the app overal but there is one problem with the family plan. I recently started using the app and I got the 14 day free trial to make sure I liked it and then I canceled it to join the family plan and it would not let me get the family plan so my mom invited me and I tried to except it but the thing said that I had a plan even though I had canceled it and that made me very frustrated so headspace I would like for you to try to fix that! But over this app is awesome and so useful and you should 100% But just saying you will have to pay a few bucks to be able to use all the features of the app. Also headspace let’s you chose what you want to use it for and you have a day plan we’re you can basically do a breathing exercise an afternoon lift and a sleep cast and a few more witch I love! So get the app if it seems like you would like it!,I was going through pretty tough times during Covid and a few months before and after due to the loss of a job and stability, and also due to social isolation. I felt trapped in the race of life despite being a believing Christian who has hope. Disciplining my mind to slow down, to physically quiet down and learning helpful breathing techniques has been a very positive experience. My favorite feature of Headspace is their collection of night time stories to help with ambiance while falling asleep; my favorite is called Monsoon Hour; another favorite is Cat Marina. I love that the stories are familiar, but change subtly every night. We have favorite narrators and settings. To me headspace is a wonderful resource led by a compassionate team of talented professionals, whose insights and stories I appreciate. Thank you for the positivity and for enriching our days in a new way!,Andy is a wonderful teacher of mindfulness meditation. He artfully teaches the core skills and integrates them into a psychology of care for self and others that can only bring more peace and happiness to you, and through you, to those you love. I have done several headspace packs over more than once until they have become part of my vision for a life that allows for sitting with whatever comes up without letting it get me tangled up and off track. I am a therapist and have been able to teach some of the skills I have learned from Andy’s recordings to others and have recommended headspace to clients as well as students I teach and  supervise. There are many wonderful meditation resources online but headspace organizes key material in a library of practice that helps you learn and use the skills say by day. Thank you headspace and Andy P!,This app is a game changer and is leaps and bounds above anything this accessible to the public that I have seen before. They fixed many bugs I once had issues with. The sleep casts no longer have issues buffering\\n\\nOne key difficulty I have with the app is that it leaves a perspective of naïveté. This app will teach you about tools for everything from meditation to career and money management, but it will not teach you nor properly prepare you for genuine malevolence that likely inevitably arises. \\n\\nI would caution people to not let mindfulness techniques promoting optimistic mentalities obscure an important skill for developing real danger. The animations can mislead you into thinking mindfulness and being a healthy human goes hand in hand with being naive. This may be more of a problem for some than others, but I felt it helpful to express anyhow since it’s not discussed.,I have been using headspace for over a year and a half and I have been amazed. Over the past year I have been going through some personal difficulties, but I could always count on headspace. This is because of Andy’s soothing voice, the amazing variety, the sleep tab, and many more services headspace offers. I have been a bit disappointed on how they have changed the platform. It is a bit harder to navigate and I don’t see everything right in front of me. That aside, this app is amazing and definitely worth it. You will fall asleep in minutes, discover new ways you can calm yourself down, and much more! Headspace also brings a great sense of community in the “wake up”, where you get to hear from the community, and the group meditations where you can really feel a sense of community. Headspace has done so much for me and I hope it will help you.,It’s not just about helping calm the mind, or helping you work through difficult life challenges. Headspace is about find your inner sense of gratitude, joyfulness, and peace. Helping you to not only live a better life for yourself, but also helping you create more meaningful relationships with other, and in turn helping other in the process as well. But it doesn’t come instantaneously, the mind is like any other part of your body, if you want it to become skilled at meditation, you need to practice, and headspace is like the best coach, trainer and friend you’ve ever had rolled into one. It cheers you through the good days, and sits with you to ease the mind on the bad days. Headspace is honestly the most unique app I’ve ever seen, and it truly is life changing. Thank you Andy and the entire headspace team for helping people live a bit more mindfully every day.,I signed up for a free year of headspace when the pandemic began and have been so impressed by both the app and the quality of the meditation courses and the sleep stories and meditations. I also think that the offer of an entire free year to folks who were financially impacted by the pandemic shows a real concern for mental health beyond pure financial gain from the people behind the company. So far, there have been options for both male and female voices which I appreciate, and I hope to see more diverse voices in the app moving forward. With some new voices on their roster from folks outside of the white community, it looks as though that’s something they are working towards. It’s been a valuable tool for me and I will be subscribing when my year runs out. Although it’s not a cheap subscription, if you can afford it I would definitely recommend.,I’ve been using Headspace every day for years now, and have completed many, if not most of the courses available. I could go on about meditation and how beneficial it is to having a healthy mind, and living a calm content life... but words aren’t the same as experience, and I could never do it justice. \\n\\nI am a better person because of this app, and hopefully I have had a positive impact on the world around me because of my practice as well. Headspace isn’t full of “woo-woo” and doesn’t conflict with whatever you believe. It’s just a thoughtful collection and presentation of the parts of mindfulness that are proven, practical and legitimate. \\n\\nOnly you can choose to begin on a path of mindfulness practice, but for your own health and happiness, I hope you do (whoever you are)... and if you do, Headspace is a great way to start.,I love this app, and I usually don’t pay for apps if I can help it. That said, this has been a great purchase for my mental health. I’ve been using it for morning and evening meditations, and for short mental health breaks during the day for the past two weeks. \\n\\nMy recommendation/request of the developers: please allow users to add more notifications through the app for specific activities like a yoga break or a walking break. I’d like to take advantage of more of the features of the app’s activities but need to schedule them separately in my calendar app at this time. I use the morning wake up and bedtime notifications in the app which have been great. Basically, any opportunity to further incorporate moments of relaxation and mindfulness throughout the day is greatly appreciated.,I got this free through an offer last year because of my essential work as a health care provider. I didn’t think much about it at first but really used the ‘morning wake up’ during the first few weeks of quarantine. Months past and I started using it again-this time to meditate. My family started as well. Within two months it has completely changed how we live! My stress levels are down, my kids breathe before reacting (so do my husband and I) and we are doing so much better as a family. You have to stick with it, but the app has tons of different options to use and a variety of teachers. They even have Sesame Street for the kiddos! I also have grown to love the English accents and my kids say ‘when are we going to listen to Andy?’ if it’s been a couple of days. This app is a game changer!!!,I had attempted meditation off and on throughout the years, never really having found anything that suited or “worked.”   Until Andy.  I don’t know what it is about his demeanor or his voice, or if it’s how accurately he addresses (universal) challenges with learning meditation, but I am hooked.  Not only do the sessions relieve and clarify the cloudy emotions we all deal with, I’m now starting to subconsciously use techniques Andy has taught even when I’m not meditating.  I have especially found his instruction helpful as it pertains to not engaging with certain thoughts as they bubble to the surface throughout the day.  I’m better able to watch them pass by like cars in the road be chase them, or I simply turn the channel to a more neutral or happier subject.  I have never felt more centered and at peace.  Less reactive.  Happy!!,I’ve been using this app for about a month now, and it’s really helped! It helps with stress, eating, sleeping, and getting to know more about the mind and body, and how to feel comfortable.\\n\\nI’ve been having ALOT of stress in my life, from school, to siblings, to friends, to the sleeping disorders and the depressions. To the lost loved ones and moving houses. \\n\\nI’ve become so stressed that I become really sick. I’ve developed this thing called “Anxiety Nausea” I became so sick I thought I was dying! Headspace has helped me deal with and understand with what’s happening with my body, and I appreciate it! \\n\\nI recommend this app to ANYONE. Even if you don’t suffer from bad anxiety or any disorder, I still recommend. It helps you a lot, and you may learn something you never knew about your body before. \\n\\nFrom the help of my family and headspace, I’m recovering. To anyone going through this, or something similar, you will recover. And you’ll find people who support you. If you don’t, find a hobby! Or go out on a walk! \\n\\nAnd yeah.. maybe anxiety will never go away.. but you can help your body by knowing some solutions to help! Treat your body with the kindness and respect it deserves.\\n\\nTo anyone reading this, you will make it through!\\n\\n————————-\\nMuch Love, Ava ✨❤️,I have attempted to start a meditation routine several times over the past four years, but struggled greatly. Instead of feeling relaxed I would quickly feel panicked and found breathing difficult. When I first began meditating with Andy, I immediately tried the guided meditation for dealing with anxiety. It was so comforting to learn that my anxious tendencies resulted in overly trying to control my breath and in turn created an unhealthy pattern. I took heart knowing that if it was on his app, surely this must be something many others have faced. With his expert guidance I have learned to look forward to meditation and how it relaxes my body and mind. As I have explored the app more, I find that Andy has addressed many other hurdles I have had with meditating. I have benefited so much already and look forward to see where this path takes me.,I had purchased the app because someone had told me about it. I knew nothing about meditating or how to do it. I just dove right in and now with the help it has guided me, I can almost do it on my own. It’s something I turn to when I get stressed, angry or sad. Or even need to sleep. The videos have been so soothing and helpful in every way. It has changed the way I look at my day and helps me remember to focus. Not a day goes by where I don’t use one of the audio recordings to help me tackle and problem I’m having. Also the work outs are very subtle and easy. Best app for a stressful life. Highly recommend. I’m better at controlling my struggles now. Thank you! ❤️ I hope someone reads this because it’s a real experience and I’m so grateful it’s helped me, it may help someone else too. Try it.,Love the app but your PR using racial agenda starts to get annoying. Can you guys pls stick to meditation / related areas and not try to push politics, agendas and ideologies on what justice is and what is not? (A lot of the “social justice” ideas pushed on society by ultra leftists that are actually destroying the left as a valid movement (and only give more power to the right), actually result in “injustice” overall so really hope you guys are not going to be part of that (just dig in a bit deeper and dont follow the herd w/o thinking pls). Yes, it is a trend but dont try to “look good” as a company using this stuff. Also, a lot of people who meditate are not dumb and understand the absurdities being pushed by the authoritarian ultra left (that destroys the actual liberal left) so you do not want to align yourself with that movement. Please Headspace - stay sane :),Repetition is the key to learning. My therapist outlined a meditation exercise for me when I began seeing him. That was about 4 months ago. I’ve stuck to it at around a 90% clip ever since. Over that time what at first seemed pointless and an exercise in futility at quieting the mind got easier over time and the benefit more readily noticed.  I have to say tue coaches on here have call convinced me guided practice is right for me. Their voices and knowledge are much appreciated. I look forward to this practice more than I did when it was just me and silence. At first I did not believe it would be worth keeping past the free trial. I am pleased to say I find the cost benefit to paying for full access to this tool money well invested into personal self care. I am a better human internally and externally w/o a doubt.,I cannot emphasize enough how meditation has impacted my life. I have been through really dark times and went so long not caring about anything that I had forgot what it felt like. Headspace and specifically Andy has taught me more than any school or person has. how to be kind to myself, that you deserve to feel good and how to see things clearly. It amazes me that just a small practice can change in how I feel and how I view the world everyday. this practice has finally let me feel how grateful I am to be alive. \\n\\nI now am working to have my friends and loved ones practice meditation as well because I can see the benefits it brought me and I want that for those I love.\\n\\nIf you are struggling or even if you aren’t please give meditation a real chance and use headspace.,Hi this is me Lily I just got this app today on March 25Thursday and I barely been doing it and I just come to enjoy myself and peaceful and I want to get this out to the world and say that this is very very mindful and peaceful and I think it’s also nice that they provide not just sleeping stuff they also provide stuff that you’re having trouble with like I go to private school Sungro sometimes I have trouble focusing so they have one that helps me focus and I also have waking up so then I’m gonna try that out tomorrow and see if it goes and works but I think it’s just so far really good for me and my sister Stella and I wanna get this out to the world and say get headspace because it’s really really nice and relaxing for me and stuff and helps me out a lot so yeah so like I said get headspace,I was a complete beginner to meditation when I found this app. I decided to add this due to some stress in my life. It was a great decision for my own mental and personal growth. Not only do you meditate, but there a lot of good food for thought at the beginning of the meditation courses. It helps to challenge your current mindset for the better.  The sleep meditations have helped calm me during some restless nights or just simply help me relax for bed.  I have yet to utilize the move section of the app and I’m looking forward to exploring this more. This app helps guide you in learning this new skill that requires consistent practice. It is great for practicing sitting in the present moment and observing what is going on in your mind, body, and environment with clarity and calm. I highly recommend this app to anyone.,After watching Netflix Headspace Guide I felt BRAND NEW. So I texted my bestie and recommended she watch it since we were both stuck in depressive episodes after a long/weird 2020.. She responded with ‘GIRL download the app I use it every night!’. Honestly love this app. It really has improved my overall happiness. Their lessons resonate most days which is more consistent than any other techniques Ive tried over the years. I genuinely look forward to meditation time now because it makes my day feel brighter even on days when I’m really struggling. Moms, if youre feeling burnt out this is the place for you 🖤this is where I found calmness and appreciation for my hectic everyday life. Feeling like myself again (only better). Thank you Andy and the Headspace team.,I have listened to many of the meditations, videos, music and sleep meditations. This is the only year long subscription that I have purchased At first I thought this won’t do much, but after listening to Andy’s coaching through the first week of meditations I realized that this was effective. My goal this year to focus time for myself and this is a great way to focus for a couple minutes or many minutes. I have recommended it to many of my family and friends. Like a lot of things in life you think this isn’t going to do anything but line upon line you build the ability to calm self. This is an amazing app. This best money I have spent and thank you to Andy and others that have provided a very positive nonjudgmental experience. You will NOT be disappointed.,Headspace was recommended to me when I first started CBT around 2 years ago due to their excellent intro to meditation, and I\\'ve enjoyed using the app ever since. I took a hiatus from the app around the time they added sleep soundscapes, and coming back to it I see there\\'s now a ton for various activities, as well as some yoga courses. I\\'m eager to resume my practice!\\n\\nI\\'d love to give this app 5 stars, but it\\'s lacking a crucial feature. It doesn\\'t seem compatible with airplay or iPhone automation, so there\\'s no way for me to play the soundscape through my homepod. It really tanks the utility of the feature that I can\\'t use a speaker with the app. Automation is definitely a nice-to-have feature, but with it I could start playing the soundscape from my phone to the speaker when it\\'s time to sleep, kind of like an inverse of an alarm clock.,I am training myself to use healthier coping techniques when handling my mental health symptoms. For example, I have utilized the SOS meditation feature from Headspace and couldn’t believe the results. I thought it laughable. How could a 3 min meditation remove that tightness in my chest and feeling of dread?!? And I’m not even “good” at meditating, doesn’t matter. I tried. I tried and it worked. And if the feeling came back. I just did the meditation again. I’d rather do 3 x 3min  meditations a day over an unhealthy response. Headspace is a blessing and an absolute must for my health and wellness.\\n\\nIt would be terribly sad to under estimate the power of meditation— I learned this first hand. I wish I would have been doing this years ago. \\n\\nWant to change your life? Here’s how.,I have had this app for a long time and I “accidentally” bought the year long subscription in the fall. $70 is a lot to pay but I mostly use it for the sleep casts and I think it is worth it just for that. The thing I would change is the main screen while the app is loading which currently it is the logo so it’s a big white screen and when I open the app with to find a sleep cast the bright screen is like unsettling and irritating even though my brightness is all the way down. I love the soft calming tones of the “sleep” page in the app, but anything but the big white screen at the beginning would be amazing. I’m sure I’m not the only one that feels this way!,This app is so well thought out. I hated the thought of meditating, but my mental health was suffering so I tried the app out for the free trial. Oh my god. What a difference it made! This app is truly for beginners and professionals. I only started meditating for three minutes a few days a week and now I’m meditating about 10 minutes each time. I don’t meditate daily, but I realize, just like a workout, if I get inconsistent it’s harder for me to focus and stay healthy. This app has helped my mental health, my eating patterns, my focus, my motivation, and my appreciation! If you’re thinking about getting it, I’m telling you, GET IT. It’s so so worth it. It will change your life. Thank you headspace for all the work you put into this app! You are truly helping people!,This is probably the best mindfulness meditation app out there! Offers a ton of different practices and sessions and let\\'s you choose a time that works for you. The animations are also a great added touch and help to clearly visualize what is being said. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that the annual subscription is quite pricy. Not to discount the value of the content but in truth, for someone who may not use the app to it\\'s full capacity daily, it just seems like a lot. They do offer some free options in the app but they make them incredibly challenging to find imo which gives the impression that they\\'re really trying to push people to upgrade vs. offering more of a service to paying and nonpaying customers alike. Overall great app though.,I discovered Headspace years ago on the Rich Roll podcast. I love the guided meditation and the meditations with different intentions and how they reach so many different needs. I now have been checking out the morning wake ups instead of scrolling Facebook and it just starts my day off so much better. If I have trouble falling asleep at night, I tune into the Midnight Launderette and it is absolutely soothing and helps my mind calm enough for me to relax. Andy and Eve’s voices are so calming and I have learned the basics of meditation through their basic package and have moved on more specific guided ones, such as appreciation, or letting go of resentment or anxiety. It has created this beautiful, subtle change of me being much more aware and intentional and I absolutely love it.,After using this for a few days, I knew it was going to help me and was so excited. I shared the info with my family and a couple of them were interested so I decided to upgrade to the family plan. This is where everything went off the rails. Four emails later and I still have no resolution. I couldn’t “upgrade”, I was told that I had to cancel and could then upgrade. I canceled but still couldn’t upgrade. Then I was informed that I needed to go through Apple to request a refund and I did but I still can’t upgrade. Now I’m being told I can’t upgrade until the app basically decides I’m no longer a member (and basically doesn’t work) in order to upgrade. All my meditation tracked progress is gone but the app still works. However it isn’t really relaxing me with all of this frustration and no real help. I’ve wasted more than two weeks on trying to fix something that shouldn’t be this difficult.  Very disappointed.,I had tried to learn to meditate for years and never felt like I could do it right or get past the frustrating feeling of failure.  This app broke it down into such manageable pieces of information and small concepts to practice.  I can meditate without the app now but I still enjoy its many features.  My son has used the bedtime stories to get to sleep on difficult nights.I always thought of meditation as an art I wasn’t talented at.  This app has some great conceptual lessons and practical tools to overcome challenges, stop judging yourself about doing it wrong, and realize whatever you’re doing is normal and it gets easier with practice.  Incredibly helpful app.  And the sleep tools!  Oh my!  Check them out.,I can’t say enough good things about Headspace! I was never drawn to meditation before and did not like the more spiritual/mystical aspect of it. Headspace is so different, though. It has a very down-to-earth, accessible feel. I love how they have meditations to fit so many different situations and moods. The app is a valuable tool for me as someone who struggles with anxiety. It makes me feel calmer, happier, and more confident at dealing with my anxiety. It feels pretty essential to me just like taking vitamins, exercising, getting enough sleep, etc. It would be a great way for anyone to have a healthier lifestyle. Honestly, give it a try even if you’re not sure if meditation is for you. The yearly subscription is worth every penny to me. Thanks Headspace!,Amazing app. Whether you’re looking for an entry into meditation or expanding your practice, this is a great starting place... specifically for meditation/mindfulness only, that is. In that way, it can be life changing. The UX is okay; you kind of have to dig around in a not-so-intuitive way to get into other features, but some essentials are laid out plainly upon opening the app. It’s still 70USD/yr. So, a tune up in that department wouldn’t hurt. The voices are very pleasant, but I wonder if using only British accents deters a more diverse audience (i.e., people who are already a tough sell [i.e., british accents = liberal conspiracy ~ U.S.A.] but would benefit tremendously from meditation, and people who might consider using British accents in this context to be appropriation/co-opting target cultures of some kind). Just some thoughts for a potential reality.,But why on earth do Sleepcasts, Sleepscapes, Sleep Radio, etc. count towards Stats? The only thing that should count towards “Total Time Meditated” is time meditated! Not the hour of soundscape after I fall asleep.\\n\\nEdit: Can someone explain to me why sleepcasts don’t always include narration? I’ve been listening to “Cabin Porch” for 25 minutes and haven’t heard a peep from Darren. Tgis happens with several other sleepcasts as well. If no one is talking, shouldn’t it just be a soundscape? And, finally, why isn’t there an option to choose Airplay from the sleepcast screen? I have to work around by first selecting a soundscape, choose my speaker in Airplay, then back out to the sleepcast I want, and then it works but this is super annoying. And, for the love of all that is holy, give us the option to choose whether or not we want soundscapes to count towards time meditated.,I downloaded this app four years ago and it started me on a journey I didn’t know I was taking. I became very interested in meditation and learning about where it stemmed from which lead me to receiving my Bachelors Degree in Religious Studies where I learned about many of the roots for meditation. Taking the time to take some time for myself has given me more awareness of my mind which benefits not only me, but the people around me. Meditation, I believe, helps the most with preventing a snowball effect of emotions by noticing the bad thoughts before it’s nearly unstoppable which could ruin a whole day or weeks without even remembering what started the poor mood. Thank you Headspace for the skill of peace you have taught me ❤️,Headspace is fantastic. I appreciate the way it puts mediation into a do-able, flexible format; and promotes mindful living habits. I miss the way the app was organized and the way the “brand” was a couple years ago when they used a softer-pallet color scheme for the thumbnails. Back when the Headspace logo was an all caps font. The bold colors (especially in the sleep sections) are too saturated for my taste and seem at a discord for a company promoting stillness in the mind. I also miss the layout/menu organization that the app had back then. But since those complaints have more to do with the recent packaging choices, and not with the actual “package” I still give 5 stars because the content is excellent.,I’ve used Headspace for a few months now and used many of the features. The experience has been life-changing. \\n\\nA good deal of the anxiety I had been experiencing daily has gone away, without any change in external circumstance. Meditation has helped me slow down and learn to breathe and be calm. I feel more agency over my mood and internal well-being. My wife has commented many times on how present I seem (and how grateful she is for that!).\\n\\nHeadspace Move, the exercise program, focuses on a mindful approach to physical exercise, something I had never experienced before, and it has added a good deal of joy to my physical routine. The video production and design work are outstanding, as is the coaching. I do wish, however, that there was a bit more emphasis on form throughout the workouts – if I did not have previous experience with some of the exercises, I might be a bit lost as to how to do them properly and without risk of injury. That said, the emphasis on being gentle and listening to the body each day has certainly helped.\\n\\nThank you, Headspace, for creating a product that brings good into the world.,I first tried this app for free a couple of years ago but then soon deleted it.  I didn’t really try.  It wasn’t until I saw Headspace Guide to Meditation on Netflix that I was able to fully grasp the concept.   I’ve learned so much and continue to dig deeper on how meditation helps me mentally, emotionally and physically.   Being stuck at home during Covid can bring a lot of anxiety and depression.  This app has helped extremely, it has done wonders and will continue to help me live to the fullest.  I ask please, if you are suffering from any of these or stress or even pain, to please please do yourself a favor and try it.  Please also watch the show on Netflix.   I will forever be thankful for Headspace.  It’s a life changer. ❤️,I used to love this app and it helps me fall asleep in no time, even though I only had a few options. But I got the new update and it BOILS MY BLOOD because they made it so almost everything from sounds to meditations are only available for premium users. I understand the app needs to make money but COME ON! There was two options in the sleep meditations before but I only used one because the other wasn’t as good. Now that one I liked is gone and I’m left with the short not so good one that’s not even for the right purpose. Also, they have a whole section for the stories or “sleepcasts” but only one is available for non premium it’s honestly so annoying. Make more stories and meditations available to normal people who can’t afford premium please!! I used to love this app but I’m trying to find new ones now,You do the same thing for every course it seems. I have completed 4 courses. They all teach the exact same thing. Get it tune with your breathing, if thoughts or feelings arise, note them, scan body from head to toe, let mind wander freely, bring attention back to breathing. End.   You don’t really get any other tips. Possibly the only thing is that each day you notice more times you are having the certain thoughts you are trying to get rid of, say anxiety. So day 1 notice 1 time you got anxious, day two notice 3 times. The thing is the exercises don’t change. It’s the exact same thing. So to save money just do the mindfulness exercises above for anything that bothers you and that’s it. No other special tips needed, according to headspace. Simple mindfulness breathing exercises, the same one helps for everything, period, the end,I am a preschool teacher and I have been using Headspace with myself and my classroom to introduce and cultivate mindfulness and a sense of calm into the day. I have found that both my classroom environment, children, and myself have all seen a significant difference in the short amount of time that we have been doing it. I incorporated meditation into our daily lesson plan in the mornings and whenever the classroom and myself were getting too chaotic. I’ve also used it many times throughout the day with children and myself during meltdowns and extreme behaviors. I seen wonders! The brain is a muscle and we must exercise it, especially during these tumultuous times! Thank you, headspace! I totally recommend 🌟,I started headspace right at beginning of pandemic and it’s changed my life. It keeps getting better and better such as with the focus and move categories. I love the different types of meditation and advice like Andy’s on techniques and feelings, etc., group headspaces, animations, sleep stuff, and Kevin harts energy shots. My only complaint is that there isn’t more of Kevin’s stuff! His energy shots prevent me from wasting time at work!\\n\\nHaha but seriously this app is amazing. It has gotten me through a lot of difficult feelings and events. I’m forever thankful I read this random users post on Reddit recommending it to people at start of pandemic. I am an annual member now. \\n\\nDOWNLOAD! You won’t regret it.,I\\'ve used Headspace for about five years now, and learned some meditation practices that will no doubt benefit me for life. Andy is an incredible teacher and opened my eyes to what mediation can and should be.  However, over the years the app has become as much of a distraction as Facebook or Twitter.  You open it and are met with a barrage of distractions, offerings, and calls to action.  lt\\'s actually hard to find your next exercise amidst the sea of offerings. Try this! Watch this!  With success it\\'s clear Headspace is being pulled in many directions (a Netflix series too!!) but I feel like they\\'re losing the plot a bit.  Pare it back, tone it down.  People come to Headspace for a respite from it all, not to be thrown into another endless rabbit hole of distraction; no matter how well-intentioned.  Anyway... thanks for doing what you do Andy.,This app brought me back to meditation after years of neglect.  I learned meditation long ago, but my practice tended to die out.  I’d get bored or busy or forgetful.  But I watched the headspace series on Netflix and found myself captivated by the new technology.  With headspace, I have access to tons of meditations, guided, semi-guided, or unguided.  There are many specialized meditations as well.  I love that the scientific benefits of meditation are explained.  One thing that helps me maintain a daily practice is the recording of how many days in a row I have participated.  It sounds corny, but I’m not eager to “break the chain”.  Plus there are also group meditations.  Sharing the experience with others makes me feel part of a community.,If you are thinking or interested in perhaps getting headspace… you should absolutely do so! It has changed my life in so many ways. It’s apart of my daily routine now. Even if it’s only 3-5 minutes. It’s easy to keep up with and a really great experience. My mom and I are buddies on there and we can send each other little positive messages at work, school, or right next to each other at home. Or when I’m texting friends I get cute little characters from the app. You don’t need to be stressed about paying for anything there are plenty of free options! Well, I’ll stop my writing here and let you download the app :),I love meditation. Love. It. It’s my new favorite thing to do. The guides give just the right amount of prompts to lead and guide you through the process. And constantly remind you that it’s ok to get distracted as you go along. You don’t become a master overnight. \\n\\nI’ve had this app on my phone for several months and finally just decided that my life needed a change. I felt stressed more often than not and overwhelmed by all the changes being forced on us in our lives. And I decided I didn’t want to live in that negative space anymore. \\n\\nAfter only a few weeks of using the Headspace app, I can feel a change. I feel lighter, happier, and overall find it easier to let go of the negative emotions I’m experiencing, rather than holding onto them, fixating on them and letting them run my life. \\n\\nMeditation is leading me down a path toward peace, patience and a better understanding of myself and by extension, the world around me. \\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough how much I love this app and deeply appreciate the people who created it. Thank you. This is exactly what I needed in my life.,Do you know how much this app means to me?? It’s like my own meditation adventure Andy puddicombe (tell me if that’s the right way to spell it) is a life saver I recently broke up with my husband after 15 years together and it has been depressing and sad without him at least I have my 2 beautiful loving kids but it still has been so hard they still cry in their rooms the minute I leave and turn out the light so it has been hard to be strong for my kids but headspace has helped so much I take the meditations on sadness and it helps me. A lot and my kids took the meditation of Sesame Street this app is so beautiful and the animations are calming and spot on it is great thank you Andy and headspace team!!,I began my meditation journey (again) during the COVID-19 lockdown with Headspace and I’ve noticed a huge difference in how I am able to pause and observe the world, others, and my emotions and thoughts. This ability to pause has been instrumental in helping me to be a calmer, more patient and compassionate person. This has helped me through this difficult time, and I am committed to my meditation practice as a result. \\n\\nI’ve started many journeys into meditation with limited success - this is the first time I’ve been able to fully adapt and integrate meditation into my day, no matter how hectic or dull - there is always 3-5 minutes that I can pause and perform some mental housekeeping - clearing my mind and focusing on my breathing. \\n\\nThe teachers are so wonderful and helpful and each session has a meaningful take away that builds upon and strengthens the foundations of my practice. \\n\\nThis has been life changing in the most wonderful way, while our lives and the world around us have all changed in ways we never imagined. This app has helped me find perspective and peace in the midst of chaos.,This app has great content, but it doesn’t work in landscape view on an iPad.  I got around this by turning my iPad on its side using the keyboard as a stand. With a more recent update, though, when I do this, the app is completely upside down—it doesn’t turn with the iPad like most apps do.  This is frustrating as I prefer using it with my iPad for a larger viewing screen.  It’s essentially asking people to turn their laptop on end to use a particular app.  \\n\\nFor most apps, not having landscape view is an automatic delete for me.  I really love Headspace, but it’s useless if it’s upside down.   It works best for viewing for my keyboard to be on the right, screen on the left.   I hope they fix this feature.  Just let it work in landscape view, please, so I don’t have to turn my keyboard on end. Or at least let it be upright in portrait view, no matter which end is up.,When I first heard of headspace I was on a path of personal growth and didn’t know it yet. I’ve gone into growth spurts as a person and I do believe that meditation has allowed ease, access, and gentle understanding on my journey. I rejoined the app during quarantine and it really helped me and I even shared with my child. I don’t know if there are options for meditations in Spanish, this is my native tongue. I can say that accessing meditation in Spanish may allow to rewrite neural pathways related to my childhood. I would love to see these come into existence and if I may help the team at Headspace I would just to give back & expand access to this practice to a greater demographic of people around the globe.,I have been in desperate need to make space for myself in all aspects of my life: my relationships, my goals, and sense of self-worth. Although I’m taking therapy, it’s only once a week and I want more time to dedicate to my mental health. This app is a perfect alternative to making time and practicing a healthy routine with self-care in mind.\\n\\nI do wish the subscriptions were better priced as many of the meditating sessions, skills, and educational videos are not at all interactive (you must passively watch them or listen to them and I think it’s helpful to feel as though you’re participating in the meditations with someone present).\\n\\nNevertheless, Headspace has been incredibly beneficial to me and I plan on exploring their options in the near future.,A therapist recommended headspace to meditate to help with my disassociation. At first I was nervous and it was difficult. I’m 4 months into my subscription and truth be told I’ve only just finished the first 10 sessions. But the more I work through therapy and try and learn the better I feel. Meditation has made a difference and while there is a learning curve and a healthy dose of personal accountability involved in making it a habit; it is a worthwhile habit and headspace was my favorite (I also tried calm) place to start this journey. \\n\\nPs Idk how true this was my subscription was a gift from my mom but my therapist said some insurance companies will help cover the cost of the yearly subscription!,If you struggle with depression, inability to concentrate or let go, and even physical pain, this is for you. I have fibromyalgia and have battled bouts of depression throughout my life. Due to all of this it’s hard for me to focus and even harder to remain present. I’ve had years of therapy but can honestly say that Headspace is quickly helping me overcome my restless mind, and my physical pain. It is also helping me with my insomnia. I suspect that, in time, I may not need sleeping pills anymore; my intake of pain medication has also decreased.\\nI’ve been meditating with Andy for only two weeks. I started on Netflix, then moved to the app and I can already see big improvements in my life. This is truly a lifesaver!,I have gotten this app before, but I never put the time into my schedule to actually use it and meditate with it. But recently I have the urge to mediate more and focus on my mind. It is so calming, relaxing, and peaceful. When I am stressed or just in a bad mood in general, it’s nice to take a few minutes on headspace. Sometimes after school is nice, or before studying. As a student this is a very helpful app. It’s also great to get moving! Or fall asleep to! Or even focus too! I recommend this app for everyone, all ages, and especially students in high school, middle school, and college! It’s free, unless you want the premum version. I have the free account, and it’s just as good! Highly recommended app!,I have been using headspace since 2017 and have always liked the content. It is soothing and helpful more often than not. That being said, the app has a lot more content now and it is easy to get lost in a sea of courses, videos and other details. \\n\\nFor one, it’d be nice to have some kind of goal setting based on what I am going through in life. Right now, it is hard not to get distracted by the billion colorful cards and many other auto playing videos or moving images. Sometimes, that feels so counter intuitive for a service aiming to make you feel more peaceful. Overall a very nice service but I wish they improved their interface.,I have an intense fear when it comes to falling asleep. Sleep means a new day of stress and work. But with Headspace, I’ve learned to accept these worries and workloads as opportunities rather than burdens. To take in my life one step at a time and observe my anxieties rather than try and control them. This gives me a better understanding of what is really happening. \\n\\nNot to mention, the sleepscapes help me fall asleep with stories to help keep my mind off of everything else. Wind down sessions to start off to help get you comfortable for bed, followed by soothing story telling that puts me asleep nearly instantly. I love the continuations of the sleep scapes too! The second part of the Rainday Antiques made me so happy <3,I’m a 31 y.o female who has very bad anxiety at night particularly after taking accutane amd developing a “reaction” (hyper- vitaminosis a) I know that’s specific but I want you all to understand the authenticity of this review. You can research how very real and terrible this anxiety can get and after just 5 minuets (2 exercises and one story) I literally feel 80-90% improvement in my anxiety my breathing is more steady my heat rate is steady, my mind is clear and weightless I feel relax (I did also drink one cup of chamomile tea), but truly it’s the app. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF MEDITATION AND BREATHING EXERCISES!!! Thank you to the developer of this app and whomever is responsible for the contributing content you truly saved a life.,Their 1-year free trial during the 2020 pandemic mentally saved my *ss. I haven’t stopped meditating since. It’s now a daily habit, and I feel all the better about it. Not saying it will solely save you; it’s not a cure-all. I’ve had other mental health services and methods to help as well. Still, their adorable animation, their daily morning Wake Up segments at the start of my days, and their Focus music when working on projects have immensely improved my daily mornings. Oh, and their Sleepcasts! I absolutely love them and have my go-to favorites at this point, and I’m barely getting started with their Sleep music and environmental sounds. All have solidified me as a regular user of Headspace.,Headspace used to have a “buy one, give one” subscription program and as a poor college student i couldn’t afford a subscription. So I asked if I could be on the receiving end of the program and they gave me 3 months for free. I used the app everyday for 3 months and it changed my entire mindset. I became more focused, a better performer, and a better version of myself. That was back when it was just Andy and guided meditations. Having the app now is a world of different! I have access to tools that help me sleep, workout, and become more advanced in my practice. Thank you Andy for all the hard work upfront. It’s great to see how far you’ve come!,Love this so much. she did. At first I was using calm, calm is good but I grew up going to a church school till 5th grade. Went to chapel everyday and then when I got older my family joined a Presbyterian church for a few years.\\nMy mothers side is catholic and Presbyterian  and my dads is Presbyterian.  So I consider myself all of the above.  \\nmy absolute favorite about this is Andy. I love that he was a monk. I’ve always wanted to visit and still do want to visit a monastery.  He helps me calm down.  I just lost both my parents within a year and a half apart.  This  helps me deal with the grieving. I love Andy’s advice. I wish I could just meet him. He’s amazing. \\nThankyou Andy for helping people.,And I mean it. As someone who has dealt with extreme anxiety since childhood, this app has changed my life for the better. I recommend this app to everyone I know and don\\'t know. \\n\\nWe are all better humans and we create a better world when we all meditate. \\n\\nI want to give this app a 5 star rating, but there is one fundamental flaw. If you get any text or phone call during your session, then the audio stops - even on Do Not Disturb mode. You essentially just sit in silence for another 20 minutes wondering if you should break meditation and check your phone - which can be a really frustrating experience. It sometimes ruins the meditation itself because you run over your scheduled time for meditation. You don\\'t get that gentle opening of the eyes and reflect on your feelings - instead you might end up angry that the session was ruined. \\n\\nI want to continue to support this wonderful program, but after almost 400 sessions, I am considering quiting my subscription and using a regular timer instead. That way I\\'ll never worry about my time. If they ever fix this issue, I will gladly change my review to 5 stars.,There is such a wonderful assortment of gentle stories that help me go to sleep. I highly recommend these sleepcasts. I really like that the stories all get varied so they don’t get repetitious. The volume during the sleepcasts sometimes seems to vary, so I find it’s best to keep them on low volume so that if there is an increase, it is not as disturbing. I have a preference for the sleep casts where the speaker is speaking in a low voice and slowly but that’s just my preference, other people may enjoy the sleep casts that are a little bit faster and higher pitched. In this very tough past year I don’t know what I would’ve done without Headspace’s sleep casts.,If you struggle with grief, whether it’s for yourself, a loved one, or just the state of the world at present, I highly recommend meditation. I know I need to meditate to make give my mind a break from the constant burden of grief, but just sitting still for 10-30 minutes doesn’t work for my ADHD brain. Having guided meditations takes the some of the pressure off, and I find Andy’s voice really soothing. Recently I’ve been going on guided runs and I find that it’s changed my mentality while running, which I also use as a coping mechanism for grief. If you’re like me, struggling with sadness and anxiety, wanting a break but not knowing how, this is a really great tool.,I’ve heard about meditation before but was skeptical about how helpful it can be. I started using the app based on a recommendation and also my own research on how to manage overwhelming situations/life events. The number one thing that kept coming up was meditation and now I know why! It has helped me manage the most overwhelming situations. I recommend to give it a try and start with short meditation times at first then work your way up if you can’t sit still for too long. The lessons and greater headspace I have gotten from meditating with this app are priceless.,You know how you get on a kick with a healthy diet, exercise and sleep routine. Every day, giving it your all and feeling better each day.  Then one day you wake up and just stop. No more early mornings, no more healthy shopping, no more feeling good just because you feel good. That’s where I was with my mental health and meditation when I started using this app. I used to be in a great place with my meditation practice, but years ago I just quit for no apparent reason. Headspace has helped me get back into that groove of mindfulness and meditation and I’m sincerely grateful. Thank you for helping us find our way back. Much love!,I started using headspace when I was in the middle of an emotional breakdown. I was dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression, something I never thought I would deal with in my my life. I felt guilt for feeling this way because to anyone observing my life, they would think I had everything I could ever ask for. It just didn’t make sense why I was feeling so so so low. This app taught me that it is okay feel that way. It has taught me to accept whatever emotion or situation that may come my way. Headspace helped me out of the deep hole I was in and I continue to use this app because it truly makes each day brighter.,As someone who has struggled with anxiety most of my life, Headspace came along at a time when I needed it the most. Coupled with a trusted counselor, Andy and team have taught me how to “not borrow trouble” and be grounded at the world you see in front of you - always holding onto the blue sky analogy they frequently come back to. It serves as a reminder that the highs and lows are transient and do not define who we are or our worth.\\n\\nTeaches me to be grounded in the moment and there is an extensive library of topics and even SOS media that ions that can be used to slow things down a bit when it seems unmanageable.\\n\\nHighest recommendation of any app I have ever used!,one word; Surprising. out of all the meditation apps i have downloaded this so far has ben the very best! Absolutely love it.... and it’s netflix show ❗️ It helps me fall asleep easier at night and gives me a better sleep 💤This app makes me in a mood like refreshed and ready to have a good day of kindness. Just that feeling after meditating is so peaceful and relaxing. Another thing is it’s so so helpful when you at first don’t really know how they say “Being distracted is normal so don’t worry” I am myself a app reviewer and i review apps. One thing though there is so many things that cost money in this app but there is a handful off things that don’t so i will deduct a star for in app purchases. This was my app critic review\\n \\nJocelyn,My employer offers Headspace as a part of our benefit package, and to be honest, I really needed it. Before joining Headspace, I was in a very agitated state and was very aggressive towards my colleagues and people in general. What I love, celebrate, and honor Headspace for is their practical way to helping you help yourself. This app is fun (who doesn’t love a good animation?), interactive, and insightful. Its library offers tons of great content to help guide you in your meditation practice. I especially love their Morning Wake Up videos and evening soundscapes. After meditating for over 400 minutes, I feel a lot lighter, compassionate, and caring! I don’t see me giving up this app anytime soon.,Took some time for me to commit to using this, because it seems like the problems I have need an immediate and urgent fix, and so whenever I used to start headspace, I would get impatient and stop because there is no immediate change, result, or answer. \\nThis application is helping me see that an ‘answer’ is not an actual solution for the problems or pressing issues of the mind. Though you may try to desperately seek it to settle the mind. Space is what you need - from your emotions, thoughts, feelings. Head space.... solutions are made with problems. It’s the in between from problem to solution where the mind/human experience gets involved.,I think headspace is a great way for beginners like myself to start meditating. It Also includes a neat feature to remind you to meditate. I believe meditation should be part of everyone’s day and routine no matter how hectic your life is, even if it is difficult sometimes. This app helps start meditations and give you the tools to start doing it alone, when you don’t have any assistance. I’d recommend it. I mean this honestly, there’s not a lot of things I’d genuinely recommend and do so enthusiastically. I won’t barge it into conversations or anything, but if it comes up, I’ll definitely advise at least checking it out, or trying the free trial.,I have never meditated even though I’ve always thought it would be very good for me. I just didn’t know how to start. My daughter inspired me to try Headspace and I’m really loving it. I’m only on day 5 but by day 2 I was already seeing the benefits and most importantly it seems to be helping me with my sleep. \\n\\nThe only trouble is is that sometimes I find it hard to navigate. To find the things I had previously used and enjoyed. I wasn’t really sure where I was supposed to start so I just tried searching through and finding stuff. I do wish there were step by step instructions and maybe there are but I do t know where to look for them.,So I downloaded the app, took a couple of breaths.  Gave them my email...then asked towing up for a membership.  Skipped past.  It made me take more deep breaths.  At this point I realized this is a breathing app.  I’m pretty sure I already know how to do that, since I’ve been alive for 40 years now.  Next step, mystery plant identification.  Now this sounded fun.  Spent 5 minutes watching someone tell me, in order to identify a plant, look for a sticker or tag on it that says what it is. You can also type in google what features that plant has and maybe google can tell you.  😂😂😂.  It was at this point I realized that this app is for morons.  Oh in case you don’t want to pay for this, I can give you some tips.  To prevent chocking while eating.  First try chewing the food with your teeth.  Second, take smaller bites of food at a time.  Lastly, drink water to help wash it down.,As a total beginner to meditation, I had no idea what I was getting into or if this would actually help me. This past year with the pandemic and other things recently occurring in my life has send me down a path of feeling very stressed and anxious, letting fear and worry take over my mind. Since beginning my journey of meditation a few weeks ago, I feel much calmer and grounded throughout the day. I feel more hopeful again for the future and feel like I can get past my struggles finally. Thank you at the team from headspace so much! You guys have no idea how much of an impact you are making on the lives of strangers.,I began using Headspace to meditate but it wasn’t consistent so I didn’t see the value in it but in the past few months I’ve been using it pretty consistently and there wasn’t a single moment where I realized it but I’ve just noticed small things like I don’t get upset on the road anymore or I give myself time in stressful situations instead of giving knee-jerk reactions. These small changes have made all the difference. Is meditating super easy for me now? No. But it’s gotten easier and the way Andy talks you through it is very soothing. I could not recommend this more!,This app has singlehandedly allowed me to get better sleep, become more confident, and relax when I’m in a stressful situation. However, this is not a “magic” app. This app teaches you the skills necessary to meditate on your own. It is a “teach a man to fish” par excelance type of app. Through it, I can go to sleep in 2 minutes or less at night, be rejuvenated during my day with a 5-minute meditation, and even call a company for my first ever job interview with a meditation for confidence or anxiety. This app is not able to be encapsulated in one review, but the 5-stars may as well be a given!,okay this is like the first review i’ve ever taken the time to write about an app on my phone. headspace hit different for REAL. i started using it in 2018, about three years ago, and it’s changed my life. like if you dedicate yourself to a daily practice, even of small increments and become aware of some of the changes that begin to take place, you’ll see so many shifts in your own consciousness as well as those around you. it’s not a miracle fix to every problem, but it soothes out some of the wrinkles of the mind which can really be a nuisance in today’s world that moves at a breakneck pace.,I subscribed to this app last week at the monthly rate to try it out. Then last night it would not let me access my paid account without “subscribing” again, but this time charged me the annual amount with no trial time to figure out how to fix the issue. I am infuriated. That definitely doesn’t help me sleep at night.\\n\\nUpdate: after this review their customer service was great about figuring out why that happened. They helped me contact Apple to get a refund for the larger of the two charges. It’s still frustrating that you can long on so many ways and therefore get charged multiple ways. But I did appreciate the follow up. Just be careful to log on the same way every time.,Now since this has helped me a lot with insomnia injury stress and getting back to gym and not stressing in math it helps and has good meditation though I have two things I would change. First, I wish they had  a video about coping mechanisms especially since mine is popping parts of my body mainly fingers which most people know isn’t good for joints. I do symmetrical things with my fingers everyday and it worry’s  my mom which I wish had a way to change. Second no more premium because I can barely unlock things without it and now the few things unlocked I need PREMIUM to do it. This just raises levels\\nof stress and is to much money. This just gives me no reason to meditate because I can’t meditate on what I need to medatate.,Doing mediation everyday has really helped me so much.. I’m no longer restricted with my negative thoughts and anxiety, but I am now able to free myself from those thoughts and be more at a calm set of mind because of this app. It has helped me realize so many things in my life, that I either had to change or get rid of to make it better and I’m honestly so happy now and at peace. I’m only in session 9 of the basics still, but that just shows how much it has helped, there’s not a feeling out there more peaceful then after meditating, having that clear, calm, and soft state of mind.,This is one of the best investments of 2021. As a beginner, I find the instructions very helpful in training the mind to be calm and happy. Even 5-10 minutes of daily practice makes a lot of difference throughout the day.  Of course it takes time to see lasting changes in ones behavior, but I could feel noticeable changes from the first day itself. It is positively impacting my work and personal life. There have been times when I didn’t trained many days in a row, but then going back to the basics course makes it ever so easier to get back on track. Love the app. Thanks Headspace.,First, if you are considering this app, do yourself a favor and download it.  Whether you were interested in meditation, experiencing depression, need a little nudge in your life, or you’re in a deep dark place, headspace is an amazing app that anyone can benefit from. I was in a dark depressive place in my life and tried therapy, medication, AA, yoga, church, and everything in between. Some of those things were affective and some weren’t, but by far and away headspace was the best thing to happen to me. I can’t recommend it enough, and it is truly amazing what can happen when you truly learn to live in the present. Thank you headspace.,Headspace does a lot of advertising, I have had depression and anxiety most of my 50 years.  I decided to give it a try.  I thought some of the meditation were very simplistic, and not espcially useful.  The annual supbsription of almost $80 is very high for the quality of the media.  You would be better off looking for professional CD or even podcasts.  Headspace claims to have clinical proof for it\\'s program.  Having a background in healthcare sales I would like to see a professional overview of thier claims.  Just a simple meta-data review by a third party would be useful.  Save your money and look around, for the price of the subscription you can pay less and get much better content.  I think this program was devised for type A people who want to feel like they are doing something for thier mental health.  Serenity Now!,I have been using headspace for a couple of years now and it has been such a helpful tool for me. I haven’t tried a lot of the newer resources, but the daily meditations and meditation packs are so good! I love Andy Puddicome’s soothing voice and down-to-earth commentary, and how using guided meditation helps me stay on track and integrate meditation as a habit into my daily life. The focus playlists have also been a lifesaver. Kindness’s playlist is pretty fire. The yearly subscription is expensive but was worth it for me this year in a very stressful job. It’s the best meditation app of any I’ve tried by a long shot. Highly recommend!,Back in April 2020, I’ve been under quarantine and been seeing my mental health to decline, thanks to repressed memories of accidents and my Dad’s harsh punishments. (He’s a jerk, but I still love him.) When commercials for this app started to pop up back in Fall of 2020, I’ve been thinking this is a great idea. Almost a week ago, I downloaded it after I had a troubling time with my homework. I gotta say it really helps. I’ve been feeling slightly better. Andy is a great coach to help me get back into happy Daniel again. Headspace might be my #1 favorite app of all time. 5 stars! Definitely recommended to those whose mental health is on the decline!,Whether you are looking to build a habit of meditating daily, or need that occasional peace, or just looking for 5 minutes wherever you can, this app has helped me develop and build something I’ve used throughout my day. If I’m stressed at work I take a second to breath and ground myself using techniques I learned here, I’ve used it to help me fall asleep, and I used it especially after therapy sessions when I need to just love myself. It has been such a useful tool, even though I’m not regular it encourages me to keep trying to make it more of a u conscious habit. This is a great investment and worth the subscription!,I have known about this app for years and gave into resistance (aka I never got it, came up with many reasons why I didn’t need it, etc). Then in 2020, everything was lining up and headspace just seemed to be something I was meant to have in my life...man I don’t regret it one bit. Right now I’m doing the headspace 365...wow.... that’s all I can say! This app has allowed me to be aware of my physical body, how to not be mad at the fact that I have thoughts, in fact it has helped me see them with this loving kindness and also allowed me to create more space within my mind. I can’t recommend this app enough.,I’ll start by saying that the Headspace content is amazing and well worth the price. I’ve been paying annually for three years and it’s money well spent. With Headspace, the practice of mediation feels accessible and fun. The service itself is 5-stars. \\n\\nThe apps, however, need refinement on some platforms, in particular iPad OS and Watch OS. The iPad forces the app to play in Portrait only, which means you have to turn your head sideways if you’re using the iPad’s Magic Keyboard. Also, videos like Mindful Earth play well in this format. \\n\\nI also find the Apple Watch app very disappointing. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but it only shows a 1 minute Breathe Mini meditation. Shouldn’t this just relay what’s available on my phone? I’d love to use the app to trigger frequently used exercises like Walk in The City or Creative Writing. \\n\\nAlso, why isn’t there a TV OS version? Some of the videos like Mindful Earth and Move would play so well on a television displays.\\n\\nAgain, I really love Headspace and I hope that they continue to improve the user experience across all iOS platforms.,Love this app and all the features and meditations. The sleep casts have been super helpful during this past year. I would give it five stars if it wasn’t for the wind down exercise of “switching off.”  That language seems so unhelpful. It’s not a feeling (like relax or soften), it’s not a visualization (how do I visualize my legs switching off?  Do they go dark?  Or just look dead?). The word switch is a bit harsh and has a variety of meanings that aren’t very calm. It’s really hard to understand how those words were the right choice. And it’s on so much of the sleep related content!  Other than that, though, I love it all :),I don’t leave reviews unless I am 100% HAPPY with the app/product. This app has changed my life. It provides a fantastic way to calm your mind and to focus. I also never buy an app until, again, I am SURE of it. Family recommended HeadSpace to me and I was instantly hooked. I had watched/followed along with the Headspace meditation videos on Netflix and was in love with the way it helped me clear my mind. \\nIf you’re even considering this, or looking for a way to clear and expand your mind and relationship with yourself, download and consider buying the full experience on headspace. Such an amazing app!,I started out with the Headspace episodes on Netflix and it inspired me to download the app, and it’s worth every penny! I realized I struggled a lot with insecurities and anxiety but after a few weeks of meditating daily I realized that there were deeper feelings causing those issues. It really helped me discover, cope with, and emotionally evolve to deepen my self love and my relationships with others. I am a more balanced, happier person and a lot of my frequent mood swings and frustrations have lessened dramatically, I am able to let things so easily and be at peace. I most certainly will be a life long meditator thanks to this app!,Headspace is the first app I downloaded and subscribed to. Its good but not great as I discovered when I downloaded Breethe shortly thereafter. Both apps are similar but Breethe tends to update their material more often. Particularly the sleep casts. Having paid for both, I find myself 9 out of 10 times using Breethe. So I will not be renewing the Headspace app. at the end of the current subscription period. \\n\\nTip for Headspace: Provide new sleep cast stories and get rid of that stupid whisper cast. Its barely audible, which makes it annoying. We can turn the volume down on our end to make any cast lower but that whisper cast does not seem to ever become loud enough.,I’ve had Headspace for a few years now and it is one of the most useful apps you’ll ever download to your phone.\\n\\nHaving all of the wisdom in guidance that this company has to offer regarding mental health available in the palm of your hand anytime you need it it’s a wonderful! Every time I’m feeling stressed, overcome with anxiety, depressed, unmotivated or overwhelmed I turned to Headspace and by the end of a guided meditation I feel significantly better. It’s one of those apps where the more you use it the more you get out of it, but it’s always useful even if you haven’t meditated in a while.,This app will not only help you learn how to meditate, but also why continually educate you why meditation is important in our lives.  \\n\\nThey offer many, many short course which we can all allow time for in our busy lives (as a single mother of two I feel qualified to make that statement), but also many nighttime programs to help you sleep, and many courses to deepen your meditation practice.\\n\\nI wish the free app had more to offer, but I dived in and bought the annual subscription and I am glad I did so as an investment in me.  Like a gym membership - but better!,I’ve been using this app for over 2 years now. I go back and forth between calm app and headspace 2 or more times a day. I love meditation and being aware of myself from head to toe to inner feelings and emotions. I’ve learned to be still for long periods of time and enjoy every moment of it!! I find myself using the techniques throughout the day at different places, in line at the gas station, waiting for my food at fast food stops and just sitting in my car to have time to myself. Thank you Andy for all the help you’ve given me and the rest of the community!! I am truly grateful!!😊,I’ve tried many mediations apps and found headspace to be the only app to capture my attention and be a genuine and successful learning tool. They teach you how to meditate step by step, offer courses for any goal or state of mind, have an extensive library of physical exercises and sleep music and an interface that’s really lovely to look at and interact with. I most love their meditation courses guided by Andy with easy to understand techniques and a clear context and goal for why we meditate. Headspace is like a warm blanket I want to wrap myself into making it easy to turn to first thing in the morning.,This app was offered for free to all healthcare workers at the beginning of the pandemic. I can not express how helpful this app has been to myself and family. It’s a great resource that can be used through your day. Wether you are ready to start your day, need something to keep you focus or help you wind down at the end of the day, Headspace is all you need. It was created so beautifully and easy to navigate. Everything about it is perfect. I even use it for my little one (2yrs old) at the end of our day. The storytelling feature for kids is a plus. Highly recommend it!!,Headspace has literally changed my life. For over a decade I was unable to get into a regular meditation practice b/c I was striving for a blank slate of a mind and feeling like a failure when I couldn’t do it. These meditation courses taught me that mediation is actually about the practice of turning inward versus about the result, and the guided practice helps me maintain focus. Thanks to Headspace I’ve meditated almost every day for two years now. Meditation led me to realize my drinking was a problem, and I am now 19 months sober. That’s just one of the many realizations and positive life changes meditation has given me. I’m so grateful for Headspace.,Last year I started using Headspace again after the death of my nephew and also my best friend of 30 years as well. Covid isolationism is hard too. I have been doing meditation for many years and yoga for more. But this app brought me back and guided me through the grief process and all that goes with it. My sleep is improved and I’m feeling more joy than ever. It’s worth it if you commit to using it a few times a day or at least daily. I have tried all the mindfulness apps and Headspace and Buddahfy are the very best.,I love the headspace app. I usually use it for getting to sleep but have recently been using it for meditation and movement as well. The sleep music has been a godsend for drowning out my boyfriend’s snoring; and the sleep casts help me calm my mind, get tired, and fall asleep quickly. I love that some of the sleep music lasts all night that way when my roommates dogs are moving around the house it doesn’t wake me. The only recommendation I would like to give is to give a last listen to date on the sleep section!! I know it would be beneficial to me because I use it so often!,So I have been using headspace. I have had to do the same session over and over again. I wish that it would be free so I can try all of the sessions without having to pay a ridiculous amount of money. I think that having to pay for an app that helps you to be calm and close to falling asleep. I have issues falling asleep so I got this app but it wasn’t worth it because I have to pay to use most of it. I am only 14 and I can’t pay for it. I wish that is were to be free. Instead of having to pay a ridiculous amount of money for an app like this. So don’t get this app if you don’t wanna pay for it try and use other things that are free to use or try.,I have unfortunately been on a divorce journey. Those who’ve been there know the chaos our mind and body endure. Headspace was a lifesaver, and continues to be. Through the guided meditations I was able to sleep again ❤️. Starting my day with a meditation has helped me to calm my raising mind, reducing the raging anxiety. I am also a teacher struggling with this Covid culture. It is heartbreaking as well. Headspace has allowed me to put those worries into perspective as well as to share the meditations with my students. Thank you Headspace and Andy, you have helped me, and my students, more than you can imagine.,I’m quite impressed with this app. My sister gave me a free month subscription because she’s been blown away at the transformation she’s had using it. I’ve historically meditated for 10 minutes with just breath awareness but these specific courses have helped me just after 5 days!\\nAmidst the pandemic and being pregnant during the winter in New England, I’ve been struggling mentally. Getting this subscription now has been perfect timing before losing my mind. \\nSUGGESTION: I wish it was easier for me to get to the courses I’ve started. It took me a couple\\nDays into the Managing Anxiety course to remember how I got to the course at all. The grey button on the landing page to “view course library” is light grey and easy to miss. I missed it the first few times and then forgot where I had previously seen it the next time I used the app. \\n\\nKeep up the great work. As a scrum master and a UX design enthusiast, you make me want to work at Headspace! Love this app.,I have been using headspace for over two years. I love headspace more than other mindfulness apps because of the compelling mini courses, constant innovation (new features such as The Wakeup), and helpful animations. I am also a huge fan of Andy’s work and background as a monk - I have read his book on meditation (also highly recommend as a booster to using this app).\\n\\nThe app is very user-friendly, and even fun! Meditation through Headspace has changed my life as a young professional to stay mindful of my emotions during work and progressing in my career to clarify moments of stress.,I have tried to meditate for years, but never could develop a routine. When I found myself anxious and wasting hours on my phone to distract myself, I heard about this app (sounded completely ridiculous to buy an app to use your phone less, but there it is). And from the beginning, the change was immediate. From starting the day, to taking a break, to falling asleep this has been transforming. I finally understand meditating and have a daily morning routine. I’m not perfect but I can see easy ways to focus and decrease stress dramatically. It’s worth it!,Amazing tools to teach mindfulness, meditation and tools to help throughout the day, like the focus music are awesome! Then when you want to go to sleep at night there are tools for that as well! Get into a bad place and need quick help to calm down, there’s tools for that as well! Headspace has really benefited me in great ways and continues to in ways I didn’t know it could or that I needed.  It is also awesome that you can share it with your family and it is so adorable! Some the best money I spend all year! Glad to have Headspace.,A colleague urged me to try mindfulness through Headspace because it had worked so well for him and I was sharing my own frustrations with my scattered mind with him. That was almost two years ago. I have missed days more than once, but I then do it the next day and the day after that and so on to reset my routine. Now I can feel myself able to stay calmer and to recognize the signs when my mind is running off. I can usually call it back by focusing on my breathing. So it works for me and I feel better. What more could I ask for?,I love this so much! It’s the best app ever! Haters back off. I love this so much! Aaahhh I can’t stop using this app. Ok I will stop saying how much I love this. One suggestion. Can you make more emojis? Thank you other then that I love it.\\n\\nEDIT: I have been reading reviews and one said Andy is on caffeine before courses and people with accents you can’t understand. And Kevin Hart? What’s wrong with him. They block out the bad words. I don’t see any of this stuff. I still love it it helps me get up in the morning and helps me fall asleep. Still five stars for me.\\n\\nEDIT: Andy’s on caffeine?!? How can you tell. Still reading reviews and keep reading the one that says Andy is on caffeine. Before courses. But I still love it still five stars for me. I’m gonna take a nap and use headspace right now.\\n\\nEDIT: can you make more emojis/ stickers and more Kevin Hart videos/ energy shots I think that is what they are called. Still love the app idk when I won’t like the app it is the best. Love it 😍,I have struggled with insomnia for as long as I can remember as well as panic attack disorder that is mostly prevalent at night. This app has helped me so much with the range of meditations, soundscapes and so much more. I am now falling asleep faster than ever, sleeping through out the night. It truly has helped me to quiet the chatter going on in my daily life to allow me to sleep more soundly. I have recommended this to so many friends and family—will continue to do so!  Thank you Headspace for helping me clear my headspace so I can sleep and practice mindfulness with meditations! ♥️,I really like this app because it allows me to focus on my process of everyday life. I tend to do too much research on meditation and then I noticed that I never do anything because of the time wasted looking for the best experience. Headspace has everything organized in a way it’s simple and easy to follow. I love the animations (they make me smile) as well as the “wake up”. I also I like that the app has the exercise courses as “day 1-28” that keep me moving. It would be cool if Headspace could also add yoga videos/courses as well :) but in any case it’s a great lifestyle companion app!,This is a great app that makes mediation so much easier than it has ever been before, whether I tried it on my own, or with a group. Thanks to a newspaper article on Jimmy Fallon that said he used Headspace to help him meditate! When I read that, I knew I had to try it! All my creative juices often keep me from meditating, but with this app, it teaches me how to embrace my thoughts - and breathe. 🙏  This is a wonderful, non-judgmental approach to meditation. \\nThe morning “wake up” videos are great! No matter what time of day I listen to/watch them! So fun to have Kevin Hart talk to me about once a week!! ☺️,I did not believe in meditation and “headspace” I have had a very rough last couple of years with family and commitments, let alone pandemic like everyone else. I found myself being very impatient, exhausted and just plain disinterested. I received the email about Headspace offering free to healthcare workers and decided to try it- what could it hurt!?! \\nI cannot say enough about the changes in my life, my routine, interactions, health, etc. It was nothing like I thought meditation had to be- makes you comfortable, is informative, real-life advice and support. Just amazing!! Thank you!,I think head space is amazing, I focus on the sleep part of it and it helps me fall asleep so easily! Whenever you put more new things into the sleep era, I get really really happy. I do have one suggestion though. I think you should add at least one new video to sleep every day. (I have done all of them three times already and I think that will keep me going. I also think it will help a lot of other people that are focusing on the sleep era. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you do what I suggested. Bye!,My daughter showed me headspace. When she was at collage playing Rugby, the team would have meditation time together. They would listen to headspace. We started to try it. Now we are hooked! It so fun to see all the new stuff available on the app and it’s cool to see it on Netflix!! I’m so grateful that you guys work so hard to provide me a space to help keep my thoughts on track. The part on Netflix about the guy enjoying his cup of coffee, has helped me to recognize that I enjoy my morning routine and cup of tea. Anyways just wanted to say THANK YOU!!! I’m soooo glad I found headspace!!,I’ve been using headspace for maybe a little over a year- off and on, here and there. Whether I’m having a hard day at work, feeling anxiety wrapping around me, or unable to sleep headspace has helped me learn to take little moments of mindfulness. It has also helped me learn to notice mindful moments throughout my day where I wouldn’t have previously noticed them. I recommend the app to all my friends, whether they’ve never meditated or have been doing it for a long time it’s an super approachable and helpful tool.,My company paid for a one year subscription (COVID). I really enjoy the mindful workouts included in this app. It makes working out more about health and well-being rather than aesthetics. In my opinion it’s better than having your workouts on You Tube with all your other distracting videos. I’ve explored new lofi-beats in this app and very much enjoy them. I’m still enjoying exploring all the features and figuring out ways to include them in my everyday.\\n\\nIn the future, I can see myself paying for this app myself.,I’ve tried multiple attempts at meditating in the past and the feeling that I should immediately be better at it, or more intuitively sink into it, made me quit before I barely got started. Sure, that was all in my head, but isn’t that the point? \\nHeadspace lays out your concerns and reminds you they are normal all throughout their courses. The concepts, practices, and reasons behind them are laid out in clear and concise ways, without ever feeling talked down to. I’ve extremely grateful to have this app.,Great app. The content is excellent, the illustrations, visual design, and overall production is top quality. As a UX Research & Strategy professional I\\'d love to point product designers to Headspace as an example of great design, but it needs to address some important usability issues such as discoverability of courses and expert guidance clips. In general, the content needs a better organization strategy based on user research. The counter of hours meditated is too abstract to consider it meaningful for the user. A visual of the stats of individual progress overtime may be more valuable. I hope they bring more UX Research expertise to the core team!,I’ve been using Headspace for over 6 years now and the app has become more and more developed through the years.  The animations are great and have really educated me on what meditation is truly about.  I went into meditation thinking one thing but learning something completely different.  \\nAlso, I sent in a suggestion a few years ago and they actually included it.  I thought that was awesome.  I haven’t tried any other apps so I can’t really compare.  I’ve just been so happy with Headspace I didn’t see the need to try anything else.,This app is so easy and fun to use that it feels like a game when you start. It’s the perfect introduction to a lot of deep topics. It covers topics such as happiness, focus, depression, relationships, and anger to name a few. It helps you have way healthier relationship to your mind and your emotions. Such a worthwhile investment, this is amazing.\\nIf you are searching for some more clarity or peace in your life. Take the time to sit down with yourself. I’ve been using this app for over 4 years now, almost daily, and by god it is the best money I have ever spent. Hands down, bar none.,Don’t let the cost of this deter you. (I have literally no affiliation with headspace professionally or incentive to market for them). If you pay for a gym membership or bought your self a set of select-tech weights for your home gym then you have paid significantly more money then what Headspace is asking for. This app is a tool that can help you strengthen your mind and find peace. $13/mo. Or $80/year is a killer deal. You are funding the ability for the people at headspace to continue making this tool better for YOU! Make your money worth something more!,This app lets you take so many different approaches to meditation. There’s no right or wrong way to meditate. I never write reviews, I always look at that. But I wanted to take the time to write a review, because when I do use this app for meditation, it helps my brain feel so much calmer and clear. It’s relaxing and rejuvenating at the same time. If this is your first time trying meditation, try the free version. If you’re looking to progress your meditation magical super human powers, I recommend getting the premium version, I think it’s worth it.,I will say 5 reasons why headspace is so good. 1 after a long day all I have to do is go on the app and relax. 2 you can do meditation to sleep and focus. 3 For a app to help you relax this is the best one I found. 4 If your a very stressed person all you have to do is download this app that is for all ages and enjoy relaxing. 5 The last reason why I think this app is amazing is because it really helps and I get reminders to meditate. Also the app gives nice positive words throughout the day. These 5 reasons is why I think headspace is a amazing app.,I’ve been using headspace for about five years or almost 25,000 minutes. Headspace meditation practice has helped me develop a third eye where I’m able to look at myself objectively and question certain behaviors that are compulsive. This allows me more consciousness of those behaviors and a an opportunity to make better choices which allows for a more tranquil and peaceful existence. Currently, I’m trying to practice having a beginners mind so I’m not so distressed by the news and advertising cacophony on mass media. Thank you to all the folks at Headspace.\\nJoe,I use Headspace all the time and I love both the app and the interface; however in order to improve the user experience I think it would be in the best interest of users if the app could add capability for Airplay so that workouts could be streamed on Apple TV or music could be streamed on HomePod. Additionally adding a dedicated Headspace app for Apple TV would be amazing for the times when I’m looking for mindfulness without the distractions. Lastly if there were a way to view an archive of the daily wake ups, that would improve the user experience even more. Thanks for the great app headspace!,I started using Headspace at the beginning of the pandemic. I had never been able to successfully meditate before. This app made it so easy with lots of options for how long, various topics, teaching techniques, I’ve learned so much! I went from meditating 10 minutes a couple times a week to mediating 15-20 minutes every day for over 8 months straight! I highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to learn to relax, deal with stress or other difficult feelings, become more aware & present in life, live more fully.,I use the free meditations as I can’t afford a subscription atm. I’ve used the sleep meditation for months and it’s become a bit of a necessity. They’ve now taken it off the free options. I just think it’s a bummer to become so heavily dependent on something as a tool for my insomnia to have it held hostage. I’ve always loved this app and it’s helped me so much for my mental health but it seems so corporate and cold to cut someone off from something so important so their treatment. Especially when some (myself included) already pay an arm and a leg to treat their mental illnesses through the American healthcare system. I’d say use what’s free while you still can.,After the this app has really helped me to learn about meditation and myself. I enjoy using this app every day in the morning to start my day. Definitely give this one a try if you’re looking for a guided meditation. daily stressors of life have taken a toll, Headspace has allowed me to regain a sense of self. The app is easy to use and explains meditation in a user friendly way. The short cartoon sketches, show what we can expect from meditation and our minds. \\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants to begin meditation.,I love the meditations and my life is better for them. However the homepage is too chaotic! My adhd brain can’t handle that much stimuli, it’s giving far more info than you need. I wish there were a more clear separation between the types of content they offer, with individual homepages for each option (as opposed to a homepage with all of them crammed into one. Why is the fitness on the same level as a video of somebody making candles?? I just want a level 1 guided meditation sheesh) I won’t lie: i find myself using the app less because of this chaos!,This app exceeded my already high expectations. I tried out premium and I would definitely recommend. The options are limitless and there is a a topic that fits every situation you may be in. There are short and long options for whether or not you are under a time crunch. There are also just clamming nature videos for when u don’t necessarily want to meditate, but you need some calm and focus. There are workout and yoga for when you want more body awareness. There is still more that I am still yet to discover!,I’ve subscribed to Headspace for several years. I’m “not good” about meditating; I’ll go months without it even though I know it’s helpful when I do meditate.  Even so, the messages and mindfulness are enduring. \\n\\nOne of the features I really appreciate are the encouraging notes that come through every day. They’re so low pressure; there’s nothing about the notes that make me feel guilty - rather, they’re just an additional benefit. I do find value in the messages. \\n\\nAnother helpful feature are the sleep sounds. The 8 hour ones are especially helpful to me overnight. I’d love it if they’d develop more 8 hour ones.\\n\\nToday, I had a date to meditate with my friend. This year we’re an ocean away from each other. We both feel the loss and we’re both having some trying times. Our shared meditation was a really positive expression of our connection. \\n\\nI absolutely recommend Headspace.,Headspace is my fav app for picking up motivation and i also like the exercise videos. But my absolute fav part of the Headspace is the Sleepcasts. I sometimes i struggle with insomnia so they help me sleep.\\nI would love however, if a fast forward button or something was implemented because I like to browse the sleepcasts and wish I could just skip the breathing exercises and get to the stories. Also, because there is no way for me to rewind the story alittle, there is only an option to completely restart the entire thing:(,I never thought I would be a meditator, but headspace has changed my life. I truly mean this, it takes a while but you will thank yourself. I am not someone who normally pays for subscriptions, but if there was one subscription I could pay for, this is it. I am so impressed by all the coaches, and even the free version is amazing! You can tell the creators aren’t trying to make a quick buck, they really care about you. I love the wake up and all the mindful moves. Thank you to everyone at headspace! I am forever grateful!,This app helped me to easily build a meditation routine. There are live group meditations, lots of topics, even short meditations that tell you\\nWhat ages are appropriate. Thank you Andy and headspace. You are doing a great service to the world. Happy to pay for my membership.\\n\\n-one month update... after meditating for several years here and there nothing has been able to make me stick to meditating like\\nThis app. There are specific courses for what you need personally. It’s helped me quit smoking, get better sleep, and I like it so much that I do it 2-3 times per day. Always in the morning after I get up and walk my dog.\\nAnd most evenings too. There are even quick ones I can do at work on short breaks to re-center. Blown away by the app and I literally feel calm now in nearly any situation after a few deep breathes. Can’t say enough about this app!,This is a great compliment to Headspace and also my mom who introduced me to this app with a subscription almost three years ago. I did meditate in college but since I’ve lost my marriage, I needed to focus more on myself and this is such an easy way to do that daily practice until I have more time on my hands after my second wedding! So thank you for the money videos because they’ve got me thinking through my purchases right now and why I feel so dejected after losing my job this year.,This is a great app for if you are really just feeling like you have enouph time to listen to one recording and being in a comphy space. I really like it because you can choose the person who talks to you and you just get that “ im free” sensation....its great!\\n\\nOne thing that makes me mad is that it always asks me for the pro version and i am not allowed to pay money for apps so it is really anoying my parents when i am with them and it asks me if i want to pay...but overall great app and all my friends lobe it too,This app is truly wonderful for beginners and for more experienced meditators, too. There are many ways you can use the app—for sleep, for meditation, for exercise, etc.—but it still feels refreshingly and reassuringly simple if you only want to use it for one of those things. As a Buddhist, I feel that the meditations do a good job of embracing the very simple foundations of Buddhist meditation and mindfulness, yet without naming it as Buddhist or of any other tradition, and yet without contorting the practices into something they’re not. \\n\\nGood, all around.,I love this app and everything they’ve done for healthcare workers during the pandemic. It’s been a lifesaver to listen, breathe, and process everything that is happening!\\n\\nMy only wish is that you could put things in a “queue” because often times I’m drifting to sleep or not sleeping soundly yet when a sleep story ends and the abrupt stopping of sound wakes me again. It would be perfect if you could queue up some sleep music or a sound scape after a sleep story ends!\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this app!,At the beginning of the year, I started my journey with the headspace guide to meditation on Netflix, watching an episode a day. I’ve quickly gone up to doing two short and one long sessions a day and have seen improvements in so many areas of my life. I feel less stressed, less anxious and more accepting. My relationships with the people in my life are much better. I feel better rested and more energized. I have to say, headspace has improved my life in ways I did not even expect to have happen.,I like that you can adjust the length of the meditation, and sometimes which teacher it is. The only thing is every meditation is the same. Only the little thought of the day at the beginning of each meditation changes from day to day, then your 10 min of meditation is exactly the same. I would like it better if they had you visualize different things or referred back to what the message of the day was in some way. But I’ve used the app every day for almost a year, so it’s at least easy to be consistent.,I was introduced by my membership with WW. I was having so much trouble with getting and staying asleep. Headspace has totally transformed that. The night stories are amazingly calming and I never get past the first five minutes without falling into a deep slumber. I am even now able to go right back to sleep if I should need to get up to use the bathroom during the night.  I so much look forward to it until my body starts relaxing the minute I pick up my phone to listen. I am so happy. Thanks so much.,Before my spiritual awakening and discovering my God, I thought meditation was for eastern religions, Buddhism, Hinduism, but I was wrong. I am a Christian, although it’s not preached on I have had a lot of affirmation in the Bible for it. I believe that any belief system can change a life. But Jesus is alright with me.  Mindfulness meditation allows me to open up to prayers and how to let go of control and give up to win. be more aware of others feelings but overall just how to stop take a breath and take life one step at a time. \\n\\nBlessings,This app, in all honesty, is quite beautiful. Eves voice is very soothing and actually did help me fall asleep. The only thing that is hindering me from giving it five stars is that most of the activities have to be bought. I think with stresses and worry we deal with in our day to day can take a very big toll on us and this help could really help with that but not everyone can pay for a subscription. If someone truly does need help sleeping, I think helping them should come at no cost. But that’s also just my opinion. Great app over all though,Meditation is an ancient practice that has served humanity regardless of time passed or fluxes in society. It’s no wonder, then, that by updating the method for transmitting the lessons, more and more people are able to benefit. In a world where we can desperately use more kindness, it behooves us to begin finding kindness for ourselves. This is where Headspace begins. I have no doubt that Andy and the entire Headspace team have already changed the world through the individuals this app has impacted. Thank you Andy. Thank you Headspace.,I love headspace so much it has helped me to fall asleep calm and clear my mind. If you are someone who needs help winding down or meditating or sleeping etc. you should definitely get this app. My favorite thing to listen to to help me fall asleep are the sleepcasts, they’re so peaceful and calming.. but however I don’t like that you have to pay for all of them except one, so so far without paying I can only listen to rainday antiques, and i like this one a lot but I would like to explore the sleepcasts more. ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ,I was trying to get the membership but could t for some reason until K emailed them and, though they got back to me a few days later, they still fixed the problem and even gave me a discount. Meditation has also been transformative and very relaxing. I discovered this through Netflix and sure glad I did. The layout of the app and especially the website is a bit confusing but the meditation is great.,This app is a great way for beginners to take up meditation. They really explain the purpose of the exercises and how you do them very thoroughly. I’ve been using Headspace daily for 3 weeks now, and it’s so easy to build the habit. All the meditation sessions are guided and there are sessions that focus on specific things like anxiety, stress from work, loneliness, or depression as well as sessions just to practice. I use it anytime I need to get grounded and feel more at ease with my feelings. I can’t recommend it enough!,I got the “free trial” two years ago. I the app was alright, but not worth $14 IMO. So i tried to cancel it every month since then. I have changed my card twice. They somehow find it and find a way to charge it. I have informed capital one to no avail. There is absolutely no way to cancel this app once you begin your subscription, so I highly recommend you are 110% sure you want this app because there is no phone number and the email is automated. If you try to cancel it will just pretend like you don’t know what you are talking about and go in circles until you give up. Then charge you next month,I have a lot of trouble with falling back to sleep, just going to sleep in general, so I decided I would try this app. Once I started listening to a falling back to sleep audio, I already could tell that I was starting to drift off with only 3 minutes into the audio. You can also switch people (coaches), which I really like. But yeah, I highly recommend this app, it works like a charm, and have a nice day.\\n\\nLove the app!,I have an anxiety disorder and a high stress career. My doctor recommended this app, which she uses herself, and thought it would be great for me. She was right!! This guided meditation has really helped me to be able to recognize feelings or emotions, and accept them without disruption. I’ve subscribed since completing the basic program and am enjoying the different programs available. There’s even one for kids of different ages, so my 10 year old daughter and I meditate together. Love this app!!,Let me start off by saying overall this app is decent for guided meditation, which is kind of the point and I get that. That being said it’s really disappointing that at this price point I’m unable to share my subscription with my wife. It’s just another reminder that they are far less interested in actually helping people than they are in maximizing profit, which is sadly the standard for the industry. Slick cute marketing designed to make you think you matter as a person but in reality you only matters in terms of revenue.,I am a healthcare worker and it has been a rough year. I cannot thank Headspace enough for helping me through these challenging times. There are shorter meditations when one doesn’t have much time but needs a moment of sanity to clear their head. In addition there are longer ones with helpful tools and advice and the ap is easy to navigate to cater to different feelings. The sleep casts and sleep music have been a lifeline to enable me to get some much needed rest. Thank you so much.,I found out about headspace through the show on Netflix, guide to mediation (highly recommend) and after trying a few other apps for sleep, meditation, etc, I figured I would give headspace a go. Seriously the best app I’ve EVER used, wish I found it sooner but I guess the universal clock is always on time right? Andy and headspace literally changed my life and I am so thankful to have this experience . Will ABSOLUTELY be recommending this app to friends and family. Spread the wealth ❤️,I had given up on meditating as basically I couldn’t stop my mind from wandering or the judgement of whether or not I was doing it properly. But, after watching the Netflix Headspace series, where Andy’s guidance and technique simplified the whole process beyond belief, I had to get the app and subscribe to the family pack so my partner and I could reap the benefits. Of all the apps I have ever downloaded or purchased this is by far the most beneficial ever!!! Thank-you to Andy and the Headspace team.,Over the holidays, I suffered emotional and spiritual trauma resulting from a severe injury to a family member who has been hospitalized, battling depression, and suffering a concussion  from a fall. I was not able to sleep for almost 3 days due to my concussion, and the mental, spiritual and physical torment has been intense. I just started using headspace for sleeping at night and working on positivity for sports injury rehab. I’m looking forward to spending as much time as I can with meditating to heal my brain, spirit, heart and muscles (self).,I’ve been going through some heavy anxiety and depression this past year. Mediation and tapping (EFT) have saved me. This app is wonderfully diverse, and I love the home page with suggestions for morning, midday, and evening mindfulness. There are also plenty of options for specific needs, and I use the kids meditations frequently with my children. I am so grateful that Andi Puddicombe had an idea for Headspace and ran with it. It has grown into such a great resource that is literally changing lives.,I’m a university student and my courses are intensive and fast. Needed an App to feel calm and relaxed to go to bed. They have so much variety in voice actors, relaxing music that can make you feel focused and calm at the same time. They have amazing quality nature sounds. Theres stories or narrative meditative walkthroughs. Theres still much to explore. So far its help for all my needs for focus and to calm my anxieties and to relax to sleep. If you are a student they have a sweet discount for the whole year. Its worth it.,This app is made very well. The quality of the app is great, no glitches not too sure but no ads. I really like the thought they put into the app. I have rated it a three because you have to pay six dollars a month to get anything on the app. I have downloaded this app a very long time ago and everything was free and it worked amazing. I am just a young student who wants a good night of sleep. I can’t pay six dollars a month. If the things on the app were free, it would be five stars without a doubt. If you can pay the six dollars a month, you go for it, it really does help.,This app is very useful for if you have any sort of disorder or nightmares your having lately. They help me sleep and meditate more often they are just very relaxing and I feel happy when I sleep and meditate or even get up for the day when I’m feeling down. I strongly suggest you get this app if you having trouble sleeping or being able to go out and run around and getting started with your day. Thank you headspace for doing this for me I and keep up the good work!🥰😺🍃,I have lived most of my life in state of dissociation; struggling with anxiety and then plummeting into depression. When I started seeking help and going to therapy, I learned about the Headspace app and the value of meditation in the healing journey. Headspace has been part of my life for a few years now. I’ve tried a number of other meditation app, but have finally settled back on this one. The guided meditation and music selected is exceptional, the graphics and animations make me smile. I highly recommend this app!,The convenience of having a meditation aid as close as my phone has made a significant change in my ability to meditate regularly. The grief module helped me thru the loss of my husband; the pain module helped through my broken elbow recovery. Now as I go they the Pro series I am getting deeper into what meditation is all about. Then there’s yoga modules. I Can’t say enough about the difference having this app on my phone has made in my life. Thank you headspace,I love knowing that Headspace is always available for me to turn to to lead me in a meditation when I need it.  I am able to yank myself out of any prevailing turmoil in my head and take a few minutes to reset, calm down and adopt a new perspective.  It has also been phenomenal for my sleep pattern.  If I wake in the night, I simply breathe and focus on the breath as in the guided meditations and miraculously fall back asleep in no time.  This has been a worthwhile investment in myself indeed!,During the pandemic, being diagnosed with a life long illness, having so much anxiety and dread I found this app. I can honestly say that it has changed how I live! The amount of help, clarity, and calmness I get from the days that I practice meditation makes a dramatic difference. But like anything else it takes practice. I do notice the major differences in the days that I don’t practice. I can honestly say that headspace has given me a way to feel better.,This is the best app if your struggling with falling asleep and going back to bed also is really good for staying and making you more  productive in life especially in work! I really recommend this, it  helps for everything and I   just really enjoy it and without this app, i was struggling with going and falling to sleep and i’m proud to put a five  star for this app and also taking  my time on writing this review thank you for the person who made this game!,This app has really opened my eyes to a new way of living life. This is actually the only app that has had a positive impact on my life. There are ways to cope with anxiety and ruminating thoughts. When I find myself in difficult situations mentally, I am always reminded to pay attention to my breath and let my thoughts pass through me because sometimes our thoughts don’t need to be taken so seriously. Thank you for helping my mindfulness journey, Headspace.,Nothing like having a checklist of things to do on my meditation app home screen. Definitely not stressful at all. I love seeing a big list of things I need to do throughout the entire day. I love it when an algorithm picks a bunch of random videos and playlists and then makes me feel compelled to watch them. Very thoughtful design choice and definitely feels grounded in care for the user and not in helping some product manager in charge of workout videos on a meditation app get their content onto the Home Screen somehow. Again, I love feeling pressured by my meditation app. Great feeling.,I signed up for the free trial as the app is very expensive and I wasn’t sure it’s for me.  App itself is great, really liked the sleep meditation.  However I decided it’s not for me and within one week I followed all steps provided by Headspace to cancel the service.  Immediately received a confirmation from them stating they received my cancellation request.  But at the end of two weeks today I was charged for the annual subscription amount.  I have no way to contact them except an email address that I have no idea if they check.  A CS chat option would be nice for issues like this.  At this point it looks like I need to go to my bank to dispute the charges.,Headspace has been a game changer for me. I’ve become more mindful and at peace with the challenges that arise every day. I’ve been able to encourage others to tackle their anxiety and issues through mindfulness and even walked my colleagues through a focusing meditation. I didn’t realize how much I would come to appreciate taking this space and time for silence until I started to reap the benefits! Would recommend using this app every day 10/10!,Am so grateful for this app!!  I am an entry level practitioner, and I appreciate the guided meditations, as well as, the group meditations.  I love the sound meditations, particularly the ocean pier recordings,  which help me to relax before sleeping.  One day, maybe I will be fit enough to try the exercises😜.   \\n Headspace has been a much-appreciated respite from the stress of frontline covid and from 24/7 political stress.  Truly.\\nThank you for all that you do to make this practice  understandable and available!🙂❤️,Sometimes I put off meditation like I put off calling my blabbery aunt who never stops talking. I know I need to do it, but “later” always seems like a better time. Headspace helps by making the experience way easier by providing a fun and intuitive user interface, and with amazing guided meditations that leave me feeling all warm and fuzzy on the inside. It feels like a massage for my brain, and I keep coming back for more after all these years.,Like any tool or technique, mindfulness is as useful as your ability to practice, build new capabilities, and the. enact this in everyday life.  Headspace makes it easy and inviting to make common knowledge into common practice with a variety of teachers, programs and content that will invite you back over and over.  I can’t think of an aspect of life that hasn’t improved a little or a lot as a result of consistently practicing with Headspace.  Thank you!,I’ve been using this app for months and am very pleased with it. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and using this app daily really helps to calm me down during the meditations. I use the practices they’ve taught me on my own outside of the app as well when I feel I need to reign back in my thoughts and emotions. Andy and Eve’s voices are so soothing to me and it’s comforting to have a partner or two on this journey of trying to achieve a calm mind and calm being! Highly recommend!,I\\'ve been using the app for about two years and love everything it offers, but I have one suggestion. The sleep meditations and sleep music are in night mode on their menus, but as soon as you are able to click play they go to a white screen. It messes with my eyes every night, and I use it at bedtime and in the middle of the night. Thank you for your consideration! Just hearing Andy\\'s voice on TV commercials relaxes me. I\\'m so thankful for Headspace.,I downloaded this app several years ago and almost immediately purchased the full version. \\n\\nLearning to meditate via the app has seen me through a slew of personal and professional crises. No matter what is going on in my life, I know I can carve out even just a few minutes for this important self-care.\\n\\nI owe an incredible debt of gratitude to Andy and all the people behind the app for helping me learn how to meditate and allowing me to discover how to just BE.,I have ADHD and this has been one of the best ways I have to help myself. That said, I have ADHD, sometimes I lose steam for a pack and quit halfway through. I want to re-train those aspects I didn\\'t finish working through, so sometimes I would like to reset it so I don\\'t have to remember where I was from day to day until I catch up! Other than that, helpful in a lot of ways and not just for regular people!,I’ve used this app & the techniques it has taught me on & off since 2018. I’ve noticed that, despite truly being a good app with beneficial courses to improve one’s mental health, almost every single feature is now locked behind a Money Wall/Pay Wall. I can’t help but wonder if I was wrong about the people behind this app, seeing as I originally thought that their intentions were good. Now, I’m not so sure. I shouldn’t have to pay a chunk of money to be able to access courses, techniques, & patterns that can actually help me cope with my anxiety.,It bothers me immensely that the free version is so limited. Meditation should be freely given. To capitalize on the lack of mindfulness/the need of people in a modern society that is sick and distressed and disconnected in order to make money is sickening in my opinion. At the very least you could offer more free sos and sleep options. And you could organize it so that you can find the free options easier without having to scroll past 30 locked meditations that aren’t available unless you pay. Also too many suggestions that I start a “free trial” which we know is a gimmick to get at least some of my money.,I love this app and have been using it over the last year, both before the pandemic hit and over the latest 11 months. It has been a lifesaver during successive lockdowns I’m my area and has given me support and structure for a meditation practice. The additional cameo appearances during “the wake up” have been really grounding as well. Thank you to the entire Headspace community for your inspiration and insight to navigate these challenging times.,The app used to be simple and lovely and had a soothing feel to it. This was an invaluable refuge for a type A highly strung person like me. However, something terrible has happened recently and the app is now a cluttered mess. So many tabs, so many options, it\\'s bringing all that anxiety back again. Also I\\'d turned off notifications for anything but my daily reminder, yet I still keep getting \"suggestions\" from the app - which are really not helpful. Polluting my notifications is the last thing I need. Please fix this. Also can you make the app less cluttered somehow? I will be forever grateful.,I started using headspace several years ago when it first came out. The app seemed to be getting a little tired and the material seemed to stagnate after an initially awesome year or two. I left. Well, I’m back and I’m absolutely delighted with the content!! This app taught me to meditate, and I feel like I’ve come home again. 💕 Great work, and Thank you for all you do. I think your the best meditation app on the market! (I tried all the others too),I started using Headspace 330 days ago never having focused on a healthy mind in my life.\\nI thought meditation was for unusual people who were in to an alternative lifestyle.\\nI never realized that they got it ,, living in the moment.. whatever the moment was . All the preexisting notions are now banished . I have been able to thrive during the pandemic not just exist . I am truly grateful that I have learned a new skill that will help me every moment of my new awareness of life !,I started using Headspace a couple of years ago during a stressful time and I am so impressed I’ve continued using it daily. I love everything about it. I started using the sleep wind downs to help me sleep then one of the meditation courses and now added the move part. I look forward to the wake up every day. My husband has even started using the app. Great, thought out content. Has become a real asset to every part of my life.,Meditation is hard. Life is distracting. I’ve seen how Headspace has evolved over the years and honestly, at 25, having these little five to ten minute sessions ready and on tap to re center my brain and re-route my thinking away from negative or distressing patterns is exceptionally useful. Headspace on your phone is like keeping a first aid kit in your car: when you need it, you are super happy it’s there.,I’ve tried meditation many times over the past 30 years but never felt I was doing it right. Until listening to Andy on Headspace! There is no wrong. How about that?! Also did the grief meditation series and finally let go of the sorrow I’ve been carrying surrounding the death of my mother when I was 13. I now have been able to picture her smiling which is so very rewarding. Give Headspace a go! I’m confident you will thoroughly enjoy it!,This is one of those rare apps that is truly worth every penny. Headspace has supported me in building a legitimate mediation practice. I use this app almost daily to help manage my anxiety. I do almost all my meditations with Andy. I love the consistency and the option to choose your preferred voice. I’ve also been getting into their sleep scapes which are a great way to slow down your mind if you’re having trouble winding down.,This is the only app I have ever paid for and it is so worth. It has been a vital piece to learning to\\nManage my anxiety and taking care of my mental health. I am Not an amazing meditator and eat distracted easily but I absolutely love listening to Andy talk. His voice is so soothing. They all are, but especially him.\\nI have recommended this to many friends and will continue to do so. \\nI’ve also used it to get my kids back to sleep in the middle of the night!,As a long time yoga practitioner, I knew how helpful meditation is, but with the stress of the pandemic and even before that I just wasn’t doing it. Headspace got me back to sitting again. I love and his voice, I love all the choices they give you in terms of what you wanna focus on or how long you want to practice. The basics one course with its three minute meditations was exactly what I needed to rememberHow good it feels to just sit.,Was brand new to meditating when I first got this app a few years ago. Even though I have some experience now, I still continue to use it. I really like that they are moving meditations and different series to help you through the various challenges in life. I also love that there’s a children’s section. My children ask for Andy by name when they have a nightmare or when they’ve had a rough day.,The self awareness developed in this course brings peace, focus, freedom from cravings. I originally started during covid because I couldn’t sleep. It was amazingly effective. Then I found how much more it had to offer. It isn’t magic, it isn’t metaphysical, but it is the most practical, effective approach to meditation I have ever found. If you are looking for something more, release from anxiety, acceptance of what you think is unbearable....try it.,I absolutely love this app! I use it everyday and then some more! I do have a suggestion I would love to see in this app! I love using the soundscapes but I wish I could use that as well as listen to the “teacher” or “narrator” at the same time! That would be amazing in my eyes because even while meditating I could have a little background noise like rain or etc. same goes for sleeping! Again this app is really amazing!,Please go back to your old layout. I am a massive here on the app, however, The new layout utterly disgusts me. I mean sure, it’s still usable. But it’s very disappointing to see that you have taken away The old one because it was far more appealing. It just looked better. I mean I guess other people might like it, but I simply do not. And I beg of you, please please please please please please please go back to your old layout. Please know that the only reason I read it one star is because I wanted it to be seen by y’all. I think it is a grand and nifty app and I would normally rated four or even five stars.\\n\\nSincerely, you’re number one fan,I am a healthcare provider and finding out that Headspace is supporting front line providers by giving them access to their programs was wonderful. I do think it has definitely made a difference for me as I used it during this very trying year. I would recommend it to anyone and find it not only easy to use, but customizable and not hokey at all. Truly a great way to begin the journey of practicing meditation. Thanks, Headspace.,Weather you are a beginner,intermediate, or expert at meditating headspace is great! I started with headspace at the beginning or the quarantine! As everything went into lockdown I was spending a lot more time at home and that allowed me to get inside of my head too much. Started having massive anxiety attacks. I recognized that I needed to do something about this. I turned to headspace! With the help of headspace, my attacks have become almost non existent! Thank you!,A bit of back information, I have anger issues, really bad, and when my sister and I get into fights I use this app to calm me down. I go to my room. And let this app carry me away. It is amazing and please support this app. It deserves so much for how much it helps people. This app will not waste your time. Meditating is so good for the mind. And there are free sessions. Please get this app. I think if everyone had a dose of meditation a day, it would help a lot.,This app has changed my life for the better. That seems like a weird thing to say about a program on your phone, but the fact that it is so easy to use has helped me make meditation a part of my daily life. That in turn helped my anxiety and my life overall. \\n\\nThe only thing I would like to see done, is for them to add a favorites button, so I can keep track of my fav meditations more easily!,If you have never tried meditation, the you must give it a try right now. It will allow you to discover your inner self. It will give you confidence, increase your focus, improve your stamina, and much more. We all should be spending at least 5 to 10 minutes every day, no matter what’s happening in your life. I just reached 500 days streak. The feeling is unique. Try it today!,This app and the amazing teachers, lessons, sleep casts, and more have changed my life. Im finding it quite difficult to even put into words how magnificent this app has been for transforming my outlook on my relationships, myself, my presence, and just about every singular aspect of my life. It has been the best decisions I have ever made and I have never once had a doubt in my mind that this wasn’t the best choice I ever made for myself.,I was new to meditations when I found this app, but was looking for something that was less spiritual. The user friendliness of it instantly caught my attention. I love having daily reminders and fun short, digestible videos to help recenter me. I support anyone who is looking for a meditation app that is more like cognitive therapy to give this an opportunity. With new videos, subject matters, and playlist I’m exciting to continue my journey with this supportive app.,I tried it.  I love the way Andy explains things, so I used this app to get a friend meditating who was new to it.  The animations in the beginning are very helpful for my friend, and I\\'m getting a lot out of the anxiety and sleep modules. I\\'m looking forward to trying out the cooking one snd the like.  Anyway, Andy\\'s voice is lovely, the way he describes things is helpful and as you go on, the sessions become less guided which is wonderful too.,This app is AMAZING don’t get me wrong there is so much room for decision! But to almost get to anything you have to pay for a membership. I don’t really wanted to pay money for a stress reliever app. But almost everything is locked when you don’t sign in and pay, it’s almost like their forcing you to sign in. I’m going to delete the app, but it makes me so sad because this app had so many different options for relieving your stress. That’s why I gave this app a 3 star rating. If you want to pay then definitely download this app.,I have learned I need to meditate every day to feel centered. I like the different places available for various situations. I have one question... where is The Wakeup? That alone encouraged me to begin my morning meditation. Each presentation was interesting, the people knowledgeable and friendly, and the subject matter always informative. Even the little opening jingle was pleasant and I looked forward to it every day.\\nThank you for Headspace.,I wish you could navigate through the courses by skipping levels. Some of the entry levels are the same for each course, and it’s unfortunate you can’t have the power over your own practice. The interface is also REALLY confusing to navigate through. I wish you could “favorite” things or put them into a queue. I see one that looks interesting while I’m browsing for something else and then I can never find it again.,Since 2016, I found I struggled with depression and anxiety. I wasn’t able to see a therapist when I needed one, but my sister recommended headspace and it was at a perfect time. By the time I was able to see a therapist it ended up being more just to learn than it was to feel rescued. Not saying this replaces therapy, but I believe headspace is a powerful tool and a big blessing that we have something like this in our lives,I used to meditate all the time a few years ago. Then I started doing it less and less. Since I downloaded headspace and started at the basic level I have noticed that my mind has become less cluttered with the mundane thoughts and way more relaxed. This app is really great, and if you are looking for something to help calms the storms in your mind or just to help you relax form a long day. This is a great place to start.,I have honestly changed for the better with this app and I use the tools I’ve learned every day. It is truly life-changing. Any way you can make an ipad friendly app? What I mean by that is, when I have my ipad in the landscape orientation, the graphics stay locked in portrait orientation. Thats really the ONLY thing this app is missing. We love all of its features and use it day and night.,Yes it is a amazing app and I could make a list about the things they did to relax me but a lot of things you need a membership for. I know you need to make money but your main thing should be people’s relaxation. For example I have trouble sleeping and the calming music is memberships only…why should members have a quick sleep? Once again this app is so calming and would 100% recommend but (if the president of the app is reading this) please stop the membership stuff…. :),I’m in love with this new version of Headspace with a pre-made schedule of meditations. I’ve been sporadically using the app mostly because I never knew what to choose to meditate on. Now it’s just so much easier to use the app. I love it!\\nThe only piece of feedback I have is that I would also love to see a tool that would help me recognize how or what I am feeling and then recommend a meditation based on that.,Headspace has changed my life for the better. Making mediation part of my everyday has helped to alleviate the symptoms of my anxiety and my medical conditions. It is excellent for everyone from beginners to those who are experienced with the art of meditation. I find the stats helpful and the streak keeps me motivated to meditate even on days I may not feel like it. For anyone on fence, it is well worth the investment. Invest in yourself, you deserve it.,I’ve been enjoying using the Headspace app for at least 17 days in a row... until today, when the app keeps buffering. I searched the app for app help, but there’s none to be found. I came here to the App Store and found an update, I updated, but still it is buffering. I went to the Headspace Facebook group, the FAQ freezes at a point saying Safari has to accept cookies (I already have Safari set properly). Headspace should be calming stress, not causing it.,At first I was skeptical of meditation. Where would I find the time? How long do I have to sit still? But honestly it starts you off slow enough that you ease into and you find the time. Gradually you find more time and what’s the best time to meditate. \\n\\nI usually meditate every morning but sometimes, after a long day I meditate at night also. \\n\\nIt’s really helping me guide myself to the person I want to become in 2021.,I’ve used a couple of different meditation apps, but Headspace is my favorite. I like how they aren’t overly-philosophical or mystical in their approach to their meditation exercises. They keep it relatively simple and offer a variety of exercises and courses for different situations. I also really like the narrators’ voices and styles. I’ve used some of the Sleepcasts too; they’re nice, but the meditation exercises are the best part of the app and the most life-changing for me personally.,I recently went through the loss of a love one and I was left with a lot of emotional and mental pain, which impacted my health overall. Headspace has helped me with controlling the stress I’ve been dealing with the past two months and helped with my sleep too! I will say that it is a bit pricy, I am fortunate enough to have the two-month trial. Overall, though, it’s a great app for meditation and sleep, which it is advertised as.,When I am focused and intentional in my daily routine Headspace helps me start my day grounded.  Unfortunately from time to time I let life get in the way of my self-care. I’m still working on that so I always find my way back. \\n\\nThe meditations are easy to follow while providing foundational principles and practices that resonate with me. In addition to the meditations there are many other life enhancing resources available in the Headspace app.,I’ve recently been having a lot of trouble sleeping and I’ve tried many things. This app is absolutely incredible, I’ve tried it for a week and I’ve been sleeping amazing and had no problems at all. If you have had trouble sleeping or just need to relieve stress from your day, use this app. Thank you for making this app, it’s helped me out so much in such a short amount of time,Thank you for adding captions for deaf and hard of hearing people!!!!!!\\n\\nThank you for paying Dora Kamau hopefully lots of money and inviting her to record the courses: Basics 2, 3, Managing Anxiety, and maybe more I haven’t yet discovered and downloaded!!!\\n\\nHer light shines bright and I’m thankful the universe has aligned so she could share her gifts through this app.  \\n—\\n\\nFeedback:\\n\\nHave y’all considered adding organization to the favorites section? Check out Spotify’s new library filtering material design. Right now it’s hard to parse my lessons, singles, & visualizations from just the thumbnail and name. \\n\\nI have the same request for the “Courses” tab. I wish to filter it by teacher availability (i.e. Does Dora yet teach this?)\\n\\nThank you,The app user experience is top notch- well organized, really aesthetically pleasing graphics and fun animations. LOVE all the guides, different focuses and the ability to sort through and choose a series or one off. Bedtime sleep casts are AMAZING! My daughter and I listen to one every night as she falls asleep. This has made incorporating meditation into my life so painless and joyful and it’s genuinely changing me for the better! Thank you Headspace!!! 💕,Ive been using Headspace for quiet some bit and it had really changed and benefited me in such many positive ways-well I had a bit of a pause and lost tracks but when I came back to continue my journey to find out that most of the packs and sessions I used to use were all locked now. It’s just a bit too much for a person who is just trying to genuinely better themselves and having to pay with this type of pricing - Sorry-will try again when improved!,I was doubtful to try Headspace at first, but my company has offered us a complimentary annual subscription to Headspace so I decided to give it a shot.\\n\\nIt’s been very difficult to find available appointments for therapy so I ventured to trying Headspace out of desperation. I have been exploring the different features such as listening to the calming soundscapes and I also just tried for the “Releasing the Wounds” meditation— Which was incredibly helpful and it motivated me to write this review.\\n\\nThank you for creating this wholesome platform. It has helped me from losing my mind to anxiety and I hope that it can continue to aid me in my journey of healing. \\n\\nI hope you know you are making a positive impact on people’s lives. Cheers to the new year!,Stressful moments have always been very present in my life, from school to work or friendships, etc. This app has transformed the way I think and view my thinking, and is always there when I need a moment of peace. Whenever I feel myself becoming too overwhelmed, I open Headspace. The app has become part of my daily routine. The meditations are simple yet so effective for me. Worth every penny :),AWESOME app!!! I would highly recommend both the unpaid and paid version. The paid version is just too expensive on top of all the other bills I have to pay :/ this should be like 5.99... especially for broke people who just need help falling asleep or relaxing/meditating or for college students like myself. I also wish there were more options, especially for sleep when I’m paying over $10/mo but apart from that, great app :),That’s a bold statement to make, but the knowledge I’ve gained from actually learning how to meditate and apply it to my everyday life has been invaluable. I’d highly recommend this app for anyone looking to better understand how to meditate and to utilize it to address depression, anxiety, worrying, fear, or any other number of issues we all deal with each and every day.,I really really don’t like being told what to do by privileged clinicians. So it’s nice to still have access to helpful resources. There’s a lot of life skills this app can help with. My work pays for it idk if I would pay for it myself. The voices and advice aren’t too pushy. A little bit uppity but at least not pushy. no matter what your background everyone wants more control in their life learning to work with yourself is how to get real control,I have turned off all notifications in settings except for a daily meditation reminder. But every day I get notifications pushing Move Mode which I have zero interest in.\\n\\nIs the only way to opt out of your marketing spam to turn notifications off entirely? Because if so, I don’t think I have any use for this app. Isn’t the point of subscription models to be FREE from harassment?\\n\\nThis is dishonest behavior, and making me reconsider my subscription.\\n\\nEdit: sent a messge to support as suggested. Been a week and no response, probably because the answer is, sorry you can’t just get a simple daily meditation reminder, we’ll stuff our extra marketing down your throat no matter what. Canceled my subscription, deleted the app, downloaded Insight Timer instead.\\n\\nYet another vampire app trying to deceive you into giving it every moment of your waking life, to justify subscribing to endless variations of the same meditation script.,I got this on recommendation from a friend. I have been suffering with anxiety induced insomnia for years now. Sometimes it’s getting to sleep and sometimes it’s waking in the night and not being able to go back to sleep. The sleep casts and sleep radio have become my friend and I drift off peacefully now every night and have been a lot more rested. A HUGE THANK YOU for this wonderful app.,This app is so awesome i have felt so much more at peace! My favorite is the rain day  antiques sleep sound! The only thing would be is that there is so many things you have to pay for! People please for the people who can’t afford it make more things free!! Overall so great app! Totally recommended to a stressed out person don’t matter what age! I had a really high level of stress now I don’t! Thank the good Lord for this app!,The best way I could describe what I’m feeling just after my first session is peace, I had woken up in not the best mood, feeling groggy and aggressive towards any thoughts. I would try to fight them back as I have mental health issues but they always seem to come back to battle me. Then after this session they sort of just left my mind for even just a few seconds and those seconds felt great ❤️,Learning to quiet your mind is incredible useful for stopping the momentum behind and negative thought patterns. By using a 15 minute meditation each morning, I’ve been able to re-direct those reactionary thoughts we all get, and train my mind to focus on thoughts that serve me. Paired with the Law of Attraction teachings, you can learn to manifest anything you want, using the power (and pleasure) of your thoughts backed by positive emotion.,Being 12 years old, I try to make a habit of meditating. Headspace is a great way for beginning and more experience people to get a quick moment of calm in there day before the business. The sessions range from long to short and even include some kid ones, although I would probably not recommend those for anyone above 8. Headspace is a very beneficial app and I would recommend it.,I used this app for a long time. The foundation was great so I bought it and I love everything they have for sleep. It really helped me get over my insomnia. However, I lot of the programs are EXTREMELY similar and it begins to feel repetitive. That’s fine for just a meditation practice, I get that meditation alone leads to a lot of mental health benefits, but I was looking for the more specific help that each package claimed to help with but it felt like I was just getting more of the same.,I’ve been using this app for more than a year but since the chaos started last year I’ve been really looking for ways to help reduce my anxiety, keep focused while working from home and sleep better.  I can’t say I use headspace every single day but on the days I do, I feel better!  Love the newer additions of the daily plan, focus playlists and even exercises.,As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression, Headspace has helped me through dealing with many difficult situations when they flare up. The courses are great to learn different techniques and methods to cope, and I love the feature that sets up a schedule for you each day with activities to meditate and reflect. The sleep section is amazing, and I use their sleep casts every night to sleep. I highly recommend Headspace!,I’ve been using Headspace for about 2 years and it’s been so helpful in centering me in my life. But when I was diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer last fall, the anxiety pack and cancer pack were enormously helpful in getting me through some really tough times! I was so much more calm, reflective and less anxious throughout my treatments. I can’t imagine having gone through that without Headspace. ☺️,I’ve been using Headspace for a few months to help me fall asleep & stay asleep. I love the abundance of topics, as well as the fact that you can do a single meditation or do a course over 10 session. I have completed a few courses & practice the techniques when I’m stressed or anxious. I haven’t explored all aspects of the app, there’s so much offered. This is a keeper. I recommended the app to friends & family. It helps!,Honestly, this is the best app for meditation. It’s easy to use and has many aspects to choose from. Along with exercise, this is a daily routine I’ve added to achieve a healthy lifestyle. Headspace has been more important in this past year during these crazy pandemic/quarantine times.  I used to use the app sporadically but now it has become a welcome routine that has kept my sanity! I highly recommend.,I can’t explain how much and in how ways Headspace has changed the way I feel and react to many situations in my life.  I only have one small concern.  It seems to me the morning wake-up has changed.  It seems shorter and too have much less content regard stories I can only define as “ human interest stories “ ?  Other than that Headspace has all I need to become a better person!,I’ve made a decision this year that if I’m feeling a need for a “distraction” or “quick phone check” I turn it into a 2 min meditation or look at some of the video content on this app rather than mindlessly looking through socials. Thank you Headspace team for the fresh content, the tried & true meditations & the beautiful sleep sounds. I utilize all three of these very often. 🌈,I’m really enjoying guided meditations and mindfulness activities throughout the day. The app is easy to navigate. The wake up videos are interesting and inspiring- it’s so nice to take a brain break from the pattern of stress I often find myself in. The sound scapes are perfect for quieting my mind in order to sleep. I can feel my overall stress decreasing by hopping back into Headspace throughout the day.,I have been meditating with head space for a little over 3 years now. It has become, in that slow, gentle way, a necessity. Many things may get dropped from a busy day, but not meditation; even if I have to shorten the time. Meditation is such a powerful instigator, and yet so quiet as it moves. Yes! It moves quietly and surely like the breath😊it makes changes within that seem to have occurred on their own. Namaste,Snow in Snowfall>Soundscapes>Sleep sounds like heavy rain. But Snow in Snowville>Sleepcast> Sleep sounds like snow. Seems like the snow sounds need a bit of an adjustment. Snow through a forest would be a nice Sleepcast too.\\nAlso, it would be nice if mindspace had Sleepcasts from all National Parks. In Acadia from Blackwoods Campground at night you can hear the buoy, ocean waves, deer through forest, quiet fire going, and the slight wind through the trees-it\\'s magical and always puts me to sleep. And it can show how important our national parks are.,So im a child and i have anger issues and when i started using this app the anger just disappeared and i am so glad of that and i have a tiny bit of social exiaty and this has helped me with that too. This app is really useful when you have anger issues or social exiaty or even depresión i had a friend go through depression and i showed her the app she is free from it know thanks to headspace.,I’ve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for 15 years and have tried meditation before, but never got the same results as other people I talked to. By the end of the first 10 minute course, I went from stressed and anxious to fully relaxed as the tension melted away. Andy’s voice is very soft and soothing. Will definitely be starting my days with these courses from now on! Highly recommend!,I got to sleep better than I usually do because I can’t I don’t take breathers anymore I just like before I go to bed I will take a breather but I can’t anymore because I don’t do that because I have a brother in my room so I can freeze but now I have my own room I can’t buy forgot to do it so I heard this app was on commercial and I downloaded it then it gets me back to bed better,My daughter gave me a month of Headspace because she knew I was having trouble sleeping and stressed out over trying to sell our house. The 1st night I listened to a 45 min story. I listened to maybe 10 minutes, the next thing I knew it was 8 am!!! Did a meditation session today and it was so relaxing. I’m already thinking about different friends I can give this to. What a wonderful gift!,I absolutely love this app, and use it twice a day minimum! This subscription was gifted to me. I’ve had a daily meditation practice for years already. Originally, I assumed I wouldn’t get anything out of it since it seemed to target beginners. After just 18 days of using the app, I feel like I have deepened my practice significantly. I recommend this for all levels, beginner and experienced.,First of all, this app should either be free or, like, $5.00 a month. If you think about it, maybe some parents were going to try and use this for their kids that can’t sleep, or they couldn’t sleep because of have ing a headache, they thought this would be a great app, but can’t use it because it costed money. I know it may not be a lot of money for a lot of people, but I think this app would get a lot more downloads if it was free. I am just stating my opinion and it may not be what others think, but I’m being completely honest.,I’ve been using headspace for about 3 years now. I first downloaded this app when I worked in retail, I first began experiencing overwhelming anxiety. On my breaks I started using headspace with my ear buds in and it made the biggest difference. I still use it for my daily guided meditation, it even has specific guided meditations for different experiences. I highly recommend this app, especially Andy’s meditation exercises !,I joined headspace at the start of quarantine and I have found myself coming back to it regularly. I got another year after my year was up and I am so glad. It helps me center myself and makes meditation approachable. I recommend it if you are looking for a way to find relaxation throughout your day as well as just increasing your mindfulness.,Using the Headspace app meditations to start and end my days has been life changing. I have been using the app daily close to a year and a half. I have gotten to know myself better as my mind has opened and calmed thanks to what I am learning on Headspace to train my mind. Thank you to Andy, Eve and all the wonderful people at Headspace that make it possible for us to become regular meditators and learners.,This was day four and I noticed last time and this time that it’s giving me such a feeling of calmness. I’m starting to use this in the morning one of the first things I do and it says such a nice tone for the day. I do prayer after meditation and then I am just so happy and just psyched for a positive productive day. Thank you so much. I’m loving this. Eventually I’d like to do it before bed as well.,Let me start by saying the app itself is great, support is almost useless. One month after buying the one year subscription, my 15 year old daughter asked if she could start using headspace. I’ve emailed twice, which both took a week to get a response. The third email never even got a response. And their only advise for upgrading to the family plan is to cancel my membership and wait for it to expire and then signing up for the family plan. Waiting 11 months before my girl can use it is a bit ridiculous.,Especially in these “unprecedented times” I’ve been really struggling to contain and manage my frustrations and temper as we are all (family of 6) cooped up so often with so many small babies. Headspace practice has helped me be more mindful and present in my daily activities and is certainly helping me live my vocation of motherhood more fully and positively. Highly recommend.,The only thing I have a problem with is that every time I try to click on ‘today’s meditation’, my whole app glitches and I can never click on it again that day. I do not have a subscription, I tried deleting the app from my history, I turned off my wifi, etc. Everything else works but it’s just when I click on that one specific area then everything stops.,I am so happy to start each morning with Headspace. So much so that I have gifted it to four family members (with their approval). I wish I would have had this app 30 years ago when a doctor suggested that I might benefit from taking up the practice. I tried unsuccessfully at the time. The doctor was right; but I apparently needed Headspace to make it happen. Thank you, Headspace!,This app has absolutely changed my life. I’ve recommended this app to friends ,family , and complete strangers when we all struggle to find peace in this chaotic world. The secret that many have known and this app teaches us is, only in our minds can we find a resemblance of peace and even that impermanent.  Thank you headspace for being that bridge over troubled waters. This app is truly a God send.,My mental health has been pretty bad, but my therapist, psychiatrist, family, you name it—they all agree Headspace is such a great support for strengthening mental health. As a college student, this really helps me get through the days by teaching me about mindfulness and living in and for the moment. I’ve even started showing this to my college friends at Rice who have never meditated before, and they find it super useful, too. YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD HEADSPACE!,I am really enjoying this 6 month free trial and will be purchasing it in 5 months from now. I look forward to the exercises that are available and am so thankful for the time I’m allowed to use it for free and same up for when I have to pay in 5 months. Thanks to my doctor who brought this to my attention and to headspace for bringing so many good and helpful subjects to me.,I have always been interested in meditation and tried several different thing, but it still never clicked. I use to get frustrated with “focus on your breath”.... what in earth does that even mean!?!? Andy describes it perfectly though along with all the other directions that they give you to finally wrap your head around what meditation actually is.,Due to the pandemic I’m teaching from home virtually using an online platform that is unfamiliar to me. It’s like starting all over again as a first year teacher. I was super-stressed until another teacher recommended Headspace to me. This has been a lifesaver emotionally. Every program, from meditation to sleep, helps me unwind and stay calmer which benefits my students, too. This app is a keeper!,I’ve used headspace for a few years now (sometimes maybe only 10 times in that year but I’ve always come back to it). I feel like the presentation of information is done in a really tangible way and the ability to pick your time and series helps really make it work for you. Also been loving the Netflix show too!,Great app for taking short breaks from busy schedule to reset and find piece. Highly recommend for anyone moving at full speed 24/7, be it an entrepreneur, executive, consultant, doctor and alike. Commitment is the key. Give this app at least 30 days without breaks and you will feel a completely different quality of your mind and spirit 😇,Meditation is one of those things that seems more intimidating than it is. Just taking five minutes out of your day to sit and be still has made an enormous positive impact on my life. Stick with it, and it will be one of the best things for you. Headspace has a variety of tools and meditation styles no matter what you\\'re feeling, or what you\\'re doing.,This app is great. After watching the Netflix series over 8 days I loved it and downloaded the app and really enjoy it. I only wish it would work with google home so that way I could play the sleep music from here on my google home at night, or set the meditations to go through there. I would check out adding a casting option besides just Apple in the app, but overall I do love it and it’s 100% worth the download.,I looked up all the app from calm to ten percent happier and finally picked headspace after reading multiple online reviews and found that it’s the one that keeps it real - love the talks and the mix of breathing techniques as I get bored and distracted with just breathing techniques .. also the music and section on movement is great. Highly recommend headspace if you are looking to subscribe,This app has a special place in my heart because it truly taught me how to meditate, by meditating I found another perspective of life and this app showed me the path to that mindful peace I was looking for at that time. I really appreciate this app, I would like to subscribe yearly but for my budget right now is a little expensive but this app is WORTH EVERY PENNY! If I could give it 10 stars I would, thank you headspace!,I bought a lifetime membership to headspace years ago and it’s one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. I’ve been meditating almost every day in quarantine and it has helped me immensely. Headspace is always adding new content and it’s all really great. I love the new meditation teachers, especially Dora and Kassonga. Just try it out if you’re at all interested in meditation.,So when I was 7 I started to have the thoughts that threatened me and it got much worse today because I always want to kill the thought person that existed in my mind but the kept coming and I tried to calm down but I just can’t calm down so can you please upload a meditation of coming down when these thoughts appear,I have really enjoyed headspace and Andy’s approach to meditation for years now.  I’m finally getting around to writing a long overdo review.  This type of meditation is very helpful for creating presence and space in your head.  Thanks to all involved at headspace for creating a brilliant meditation resource at a fair and reasonable price!  I appreciate the whole team that works to make this such a great thing!!,Headspace is my place to go when I need to get away sometimes. Wether I’m in a car with my family or my bed. You can even mend the time of the meditation to fit your schedule. I highly recommend that everyone should use this app, for it does not require any skill. It gently guides you through a meditation, or a sleep story, and many more options. 5 stars for me!,Headspace is a great app that has everything you may need to get some mindfulness in your life. There’s everything to learn meditating, sleep well, start your day right and even more. Also I like the design very much, it’s easy to use and pleasant to look at.\\nI want to thank Andy and all the members of the Headspace team for this amazing work they have made!,Ever since I found out I received a free subscription to Headspace for teachers, I decided to give it a try. This app is beautifully made for me as an adult and for my elementary students as well. In a time where mindfulness is as important as ever, this app delivers. Here are some of my favorite features:\\n\\n- meditation “packs” that deal with everything from the basics to coping with cravings\\n- a daily “wake-up” which always teaches me something new and helps me prep for the day\\n- amazing nighttime sleep casts and wind downs \\n- music for mindfulness\\n\\nI could go on and on. Even if you are not an educator I would recommend getting the subscription - the full suite of amazing features are extremely worth it.,I like issuing this app so much. I love the nighttime bed stories and how they incorporate meditation ans adult bedtime stories to help lull you to sleep. And the session they made to help you focus on each this at a time. I’m doing the Kindness one now and loved the visualization of filling yourself up with light. Highly recommend, I have Calm app also but I use this more and will stick to in the future. Be well,Everything about the app is great and would be a 5 star rating if the iPad app supported Landscape mode. I use a Smart Keyboard and rarely orient my device in portrait except for when I have to in the morning for headspace. Thanks.\\n\\nUpdate 2021! Nothing has changed. Still lacks landscape mode. I know its petty, and I should be mindful of my frustrations, but it would be cool if this app functioned like 99% of other iPad apps I use. I raised it to 3 stars in the event that might make the review more visible.,I’ve used different applications in order to get used to meditating on a daily basis. This app finally did the job. The library is growing on a good pace and I really enjoy the wakeup.\\n\\nHowever, recently I can’t access the wakeup and it’s really bothering me. And apparently other people are experiencing the same problem. I hope the bug gets fixed soon.,I had a stressful job that I recently left that caused me to develop anxiety and panic attacks. It was a nightmare because I never knew when the attacks would come, and sometimes, there weren’t even any triggers. Headspace has helped me tremendously and is my go to when I’m feeling anxious. I go listen to an episode before my heart starts to race and lately it stops my panic attacks in its tracks.,I had forgotten to cancel my annual subscription and was charged this past January for an annual subscription.  I loved the app but didn’t have the time nor dedication to continue with it.  When I emailed their customer service about my subscription, they got back with me in a timely manner and gave me a full refund as well as canceling my subscription for me!,I Love it. For me, it was a means to start meditation. I had been wanting to meditate for years and always felt intimidated thinking I couldn’t sit still and think of “nothing”. I didn’t understand what meditation was. \\n Headspace let me start our at 2 or 3 minute sessions and as I felt the benefits (immediately ) I was able to gradually increase session time. \\n  I now regularly do 20 minute sessions,i’ve been meditating for some time now and i originally saw the Netflix series  on how to meditate and it was very well put together and helpful so much. I have the best meditations when following these guided meditations and it really helps me so much through my day! I LOVE everyone who was a part to make headspace and to help other people. mwuah good job on this app it’s my favorite thing ever.,I started using Headspace regularly 3 months ago. I didn’t know how cluttered my mind was until I tried to sit in silence for 10 minutes.... That one experience changed my perception of myself and the category of meditation. I’ve got a long ways to go, but headspace scales with my learning. It really is the holistic package👌🏻 u the techniques behind the practice!,I’ve been dancing with anxiety my whole life. Not until I started meditating with the help of Headspace did I realize that my pursuit to rid myself of anxiety was a fool’s errand. Instead, I’ve learned how to embrace it and dance with it. I’ve also learned how to experience the world from the seat of the self, and understand my own consciousness more. I’m able to experience joy, and sustain it.,Honestly this app has been so amazing. To be truthful an app doesn’t change your life but this definitely helps guide you to be mindful and just managing my stress. I struggle with a lot of anxiety with school and work. This app has given me tools to help manage it but again you have to put the work in but I think it’s worth it.,I am a daily user, I am enjoying practicing meditation. I would like to start to use the yoga or other workout videos, however since I use it on my phone, it’s very hard to see when I’m trying to move. Can you please add the ability to cast to the television device? We have a Google Chromecast and it would be great to be able to cast the workout videos to a larger screen.,My favorite thing about this app is that it is not just a guided meditation app, it becomes your private meditation teacher that teaches you about the practice. Also, there is such a variety of content that I have been meditating with it everyday for 556 days in a row and I\\'m still finding new things courses and packs to keep things interesting.,I held off using this for so long and I regret that wasted time. Headspace is a great tool to build and endlessly sharpen your meditation skills. Ever since I started I have become calmer, more focused, more confident, more creative, and genuinely more in touch with myself and those around me. The teachers are amazing and the sleepcasts are a fantastic tool if you have problems falling asleep some nights.,My university was giving out free Pro accounts — I recommend checking your school too!\\n\\nThe quality of Andy’s lessons are incredible. He presents the practice of meditation so measured, so thoughtfully and well understood that even myself as a completely non-spiritual person I am able to appreciate meditation simply for the techniques and strategies it is. Wonderful stuff.,I can’t tell you how much Headspace has changed my life! It helped me to get through life as a medical worker in the midst of Covid-19. It has helped with my anxiety, my anger management and my relationships with others and myself. If you haven’t tried it- I challenge you to try meditation using this app every day for 30 days. It is truly life altering!,Andy is great. No bells and whistles just what you need. Definitely worth a try for anyone who is looking for an everyday guided meditation to help with mindfulness.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Everyone is different and has different styles. I think headspace is great and could help a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean it’s for everyone. Recommend just to try me see if it’s right for you.,I started using this app at least 6 years ago.  I now use it daily. I find that it helps me understand and cope with my everyday emotions as well as have better relationships with my friends and family. I also feel more productive because I am able to focus on one task at a time. This app has been life changing for me.,Recently I’ve been having a lot of stress and didn’t know how to handle it, I’ve also been having trouble with unhealthy habits I’ve been having. When I saw an ad for this app and see if could help me, it has changed my life for the better, I’ve only done 3 sessions and I’m already feeling so much better than before.😌,Headspace is incredible! I’m an engineer so I have always been skeptical of the mind how people who believe in things like manifestation might have been crazy. BUT they aren’t! Every time I do a meditation I figure out something new about myself, or it helps me uncover a solution to problem that had been concerning me. Trust in yourself and in your mind, you are powerful!,I’ve had chronic insomnia for many years and tried the sleepcasts as a last resort. I was pleasantly surprised and very happy to find that most nights I am asleep before the story ends.\\nFour stars because unfortunately I am now basically addicted to Eve’s voice and can only fall asleep to her stories. I’d love it if you could please provide an choice for male/female (Eve) voice selection like the mediations offer. \\nThank you!!,I have been using this app Headspace for a number of years. I observed myself a noticeable difference on mornings that I do not take time to sit. This app helps me set a positive tone in which to begin my day openly and with calmness. I am a 64-year-old high school special education teacher. It is imperative that I stay centered in my work. I am grateful for this app to help me make that happen.,I struggle a lot with medical. I love music, so the music in the back helps me so much. They should add queen into this. It helps when I breathe 🧘\\u200d♀️. I like paying money for this because it’s worth it. I don’t like hospitals, but i Am always in them do this is awesome for me to chill out. Thank you for reading. please buy a red iPhone to support aids,It’s rare to find something self help like that truly works. This is worth all the time I can throw at it. My day to day life can be so much calmer because the time I take to meditate. I have had horrible anger issues for as long as I can remember and I actually feel them easing. I stopped yelling so much. Maybe soon I will begin to smile more.,I really like this app, it helps a lot with calming down, falling asleep and things like that. The only problem for me personally is that most of the sessions on anxiety are locked. I get anxiety at night so I was hoping this would help me but, considering most of the the anxiety ones ( that I saw at least) were locked I was a bit disappointed. Other than that though great app.,Headspace is cool. Don’t get me wrong—I love the idea and the concepts that it’s built around but the paywall is ridiculous. That’s my only problem with it. I’ve deleted this app and redownloaded it multiple times in the past few years and every time I’ve deleted—it’s because there is nothing to do.\\n\\nSure, there are four or five short meditations, sounds, and headspaces, but there is so much content unavailable to non-premium users. It’s annoying and the app is, essentially, useless unless you pay the expensive fee. As a minor going into highschool I don’t have the money or the time. \\n\\nIf you’re considering getting this app, by all means, get it. Try the premium. I’m sure it’s helpful.\\n\\nMy only objection is the paywall. If that’s ever removed (or at least lessened, because I understand you need money) then maybe I’ll consider this app again and boosting my review. \\n\\nThank you for your time.,I didn’t know how to meditate in a real way, which this app has easily guided me through, but it also helped me learn so many tricks that therapists have also taught me to deal with stress and anxiety throughout the day. It’s such a godsend and has focuses on so many things to help you improve your life. I love it, thank you for making this app!,I work at home and live with a four year old 24/7. Add that single reality to many other surprisingly gruesome variables and you have my life. \\n\\nThis app brought me back to the land of the trying-to-be-skillful-living and for that, I give it four stars. \\n\\nThe fifth star is for the delicious fact that the sound of Andy’s voice puts my daughter to sleep like a shot.,Everything about this app is the perfect introduction to meditation. I’m still working on my ability to keep focus but every SOS and course I’ve tried when I needed it has been very helpful. I just opened the app to see if they had a meditation about having a difficult conversation and of course they did!! Thanks,The meditation basics they give you for free are wonderful! However, you do need to buy the subscription in order to do anything else. Maybe if you were to buy the app, instead of it being free, then get everything after you have a 1 time purchase it would be 5 stars. Still though, I’m seriously considering buying the subscription 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️,I’ve been meditating for a few years now I just got this app three days ago. I’m still figuring out all the cool settings and such, but I love that the app is really good at working with MY schedule. I can set alarms for times to meditate and put it on my calendar with just a few buttons in the app. Super efficient. I definitely recommend so far.,Thank you for making this free for educators.

There are so many tools in Headspace, something for every day!,When I first started to use headspace I thought it was useless but as soon as I got more into it it started to calm me down and make my head light when I had a lot to deal with you should try it when you first start it doesn’t really feel right  but As soon as you get really into it it starts to get good,I wasn’t able to access silent meditation as a personal practice until finding this app, and it’s so much more than just that. Every phone should come with this pre-downloaded, it has something for everyone. Definitely worth the yearly subscription price for access to all content!,A decent and general all around app but is missing some features.... \\nNo deep sleep or hypnosis that many popular sleep and meditation apps have like Breethe. \\n\\nAlso lacks the ability to Chromecast or push any of the workout videos to TV streaming devices from phone. This is a pretty standard video feature these days and it was surprising that an app as popular as this doesn\\'t have support for casting to screen.,I was recommended Headspace by my physical therapist. It came from a casual conversation, and when I gave it a try, it resolved the tension around my neck that drove me to go to physical therapy in the first place.\\n\\nEver since, I went on and off this app until one day, the tension around the neck returned to the degree that I had experienced earlier on.\\n\\nI quickly took up Headspace once more, and it has since been a daily tool for me to let go of tension, and return to the present.\\n\\nI cannot thank Andy and the team enough for the courses that changed the subjective experience of my life.\\n\\nWhether you are tense or fine but curious, I recommend a try to see how you feel.,I have been very overwhelmed lately with work and Headspace have helped me so much to wind down!!

My sleep has I improved greatly from the breathing exercises. I did try a few of the other apps that are available and most definitely think Headspace is the one that seems almost custom made for me and my lifestyle,II have a very busy practice seeing clients in psychotherapy. It’s emotionally draining. Doing Headspace in the morning helps me fully be present and focused on my clients. In addition, I end the day feeling calm. If I miss a day, I often end my day with a headache. At this point, I prefer to do thePro offerings, but I love to intersperse other themed meditation series to give more variety and motivation for my practice.,I’d toyed with meditating since a groovy teacher, many years ago, introduced my middle school choral class to it.

I redownloaded recently due to stress and help falling asleep. However, I was SHOCKED when I tried to listen to the sleep programs like I used to and I was asked to pay $13 just for a month. Honestly, that is an outrageous fee for something that used to be free. If it was a $5 one time fee, I’d gladly pay it. I am honestly embarrassed that I used to recommend this app to my friends and family and talked about it up until recently.,I’ve been using headspace for years now and it’s been such a pleasure. It’s really developed my meditation practice as well as all the side effects you hear about. And his voice is so peaceful and all the sleep casts really have saved my night and sleepless adventures. I’ve learned so much through this app and it’s been a great tool of self discovery,-Review-    \\nTo the dev that wrote to me. I feel nice that I got a response to my original review just I don’t have problems signing up or logging in, which makes me believe that their going of a script of responses or the “dev responses” are bots responding I am currently not sure of either if they are a bot or whatever. Just my review was not to tell a problem like troubles signing in or logging up I am not signed up or plan to just lower the prices.\\n\\n  Sincerely Frozen Echos.\\n                       -UPDATE-\\nTo my regards they have lowered the prices I may sign up now so now This review may become out dated same with my first review I am fairly happy now and if you do lower the prices lower the “Better Deal” price lower.,I love Headspace.

I highly recommend Andy’s soothing voice, as well as the wonderful sleep meditations,I live alone and have just retired. The pandemic has made my life rather small. There is much to read, study, and watch, but I don’t want to just fill time. I want to LIVE and appreciate every moment I have left.  Headspace points me in a direction that helps me see possibilities. I meditate, and I also appreciate the beauty of the nature videos. Kevin Hart helps, too\\n\\nNYC,I have no words for how much Headspace has helped me deepen my Meditation practice on all levels.

You change the world by changing yourself! 💖,Top-notch app. It feels like a high quality experience, with fun illustrations. The library is impressive with lots of good content. One minor gripe I have with the iPad app is that I’d love to be able to use it in landscape view. I use my iPad in landscape all the time and it’s a hassle to rotate it just for this app. Otherwise, the app is a pretty flawless experience.,Now Imma tell you this this thing WORK cause I really trying to get more energy when I go to sleep cause I always stay up all night and barely get any sleep and this help me so well I didn’t subscribe but I rather listen to the two things over and over again I prefer you get this right now before it’s too late.,I spent a lot of money on a Mindfulness class in 2013.

As long as I always have the ability to pay the small annual fee, I will never go without Headspace.,I started using headspace as a way to de-stress during nursing school 3 years ago and it changed my life.

I had an issue with my account and couldn’t remember the email address I used. Two of their members went above and beyond for me.,I appreciate all of the meditations that I can get to even though I don’t have a membership, but I thought that membership was free for teacher?    I can’t see what I am writing so I hope it is grammatically correct!  Let me know if there is a way for teachers to sign up for free!  Thank you for what we can get from the sotw though!,I never write reviews, but this has been one of the most important apps I have ever used.

Thank you Headspace!,I am loving the headspace app and have shared it with several family and friends who also enjoy it very much. GREAT way to start and/or end a day. It would be wonderful if I could share specific meditations or other features with my buddies... The search function doesn’t work well. That would be my only critique.

And they were so nice. Above and beyond my expectations.,Sometimes I feel at night that I shouldn’t go to sleep and keeping using devices, I saw this app and wanted to try it out.

No, not the sole arbiter of life change. But definitely a critical ingredient. I have been consistently using Headspace for several years, logging over 15,200 minutes in over 1,000 sessions. Do something long enough and it changes you; I recommend letting Headspace into your life. So awesome!,I’m enjoying the daily meditations. They have great pace, great teachers and I love the option to choose the length of time. I wish they had better story options for sleep though. The sleep casts are ok but I prefer actual stories, not just describing a place. The incorporation of a wind down at the beginning is a great feature, however.,This app has a ton of potential to help with everything from sleeplessness to relationships to anxiety. Like most things worth doing it requires patience and persistence, but even if you’re thinking meditation isn’t for you, stick with this because it can be life-changing. Andy and his team are wonderful. And the sleepcasts are the best!,Listening to Headspace has made a significant impact on my life.  The courses, wake-ups, sleepcasts, and mindful moments help me to start and end each day with a focused mind. I use the lessons throughout the day to stay more relaxed when issues arise. I have gifted it to friends and highly recommend it to anyone willing to use it wisely.,A lot of people don’t know that there are now workouts on headspace - they’re mellow but effective and help to do before sitting to meditate if I’m having trouble settling down. I also love the focus music on headphones for doing homework in my small apt when other people are doing noisy things. It’s like being in another room!,This app has become part of my daily routine. It has helped with so many aspects of my life. But, most of all has improved my mental health dramatically. I struggle with anxiety and depression, particularly depression.

It’s a top to step outside of depressive thoughts and see the silly stories they tell.,This simple app has enabled me to let go of emotional baggage and identify my toxic traits that have been sabotaging my marriage and other relationships.

It looks like Moodnotes and way too bubbly cartoony... let’s go back to clean design. Anyway still a great app and love the sleeping soundscapes. But the design choices knocked off 2 stars as we all know design correlates with “calmness”,I’m enjoying the ability to improve different areas at one time with this app. Bot only meditations but a variety of movement choices, helpful topics and support for common areas if concern. The group meditation is nice, too. New to this app so I’m hoping I will be able to discover all it has to offer. Thanks!,Even if mindfulness might not be for everyone (I still recommend to give it a try), this app has a lot to offer. Lots of resources (guided meditations, timer for unguided meditations, music, videos to give a break from the urban, rushing pace... Lots of offers and constant updates. A kind, graphic environment. It is really useful and helpful.,This app saved my life. I am eternally thankful for having such a privileged opportunity to help myself.

I will happily give 5 stars IF all the nighttime meditations can play while another music app can play in the background, so I don\\'t have to constantly wake up in the middle of the night. Thank you!,Life for me is especially stressful these days with COVID-19, politics, and work. These meditations are wonderful. They don’t take very long, and really help get me relaxed and in a better space. Then I can either sleep better, enjoy time with my family, or work more efficiently, depending on the situation and time of day. Highly recommended.,I first learned about this app 2 years ago, when I first attempted to meditate. I loved the trial courses so much that I ended up getting a yearly subscription. I love that there is so much content on Headspace that I never run out of new meditations to try or new meditation courses to do. It’s amazing what setting aside 5 minutes a day to meditate can do for me!,I only just started meditating mostly as a means to calm my easily stressed mind from college and I can say that every time I use it I feel a great sense of calm. It has only been a week and I am beginning to have a whole now look on life and how to approach it. This app is definitely worth the money.,Excellent courses to get you started. I finally learned how to meditate from this app. There is a lot of guidance as you are starting and learning for first 3 months or so. Once you get through the initial courses, there is no guidance that I can find. Just an overwhelming menu of choices. I would like recommendations on what to do after you complete the pro courses. But I will always be thankful for Andy making it click!,I genuinely can’t praise this app enough.  From guidance for beginners to daily meditations (that somehow always seem to touch on the exact area I need to work on that day) this app has it all.  Even workouts to move you, relax you, or unwind you and meditations to help you sleep.  Plus Kevin Hart motivational moments??  Come on, this app is phenomenal!!,Hi! I really really love this app a lot but, there’s something I want to point out. There’s not enough free ones. I’m pretty sure there are only 2 free ones to use to help sleep. All I really needed this app for was for my sleep. I tried to find more apps that had free ones but, they also required premium or membership. I really hope they can put out more free ones. Thank you!,I have struggled with anxiety for almost a year now, loud noises and certain people stress me out and make me a shell of my outgoing self. Through this app I am able to learn and Focus more in class and my grades and improved because of that! Yes there is a monthly fee if you want full access but in my eyes it is so very worth it!,Until Headspace I was never able to successfully meditate or get the benefits. With so many helpful techniques and approaches to mindfulness, I learn something new every day and feel better. I am so grateful for the creators and their generosity. \\n\\nThank you Headspace for helping so many of us weather this storm we are in together.,I’ve had plenty of trouble falling asleep since having my son a year ago. Since using the sleep stories for the last few weeks I’ve been able to fall asleep more easily. I still wake up in the middle of the night 1-2 times but at least I’ve fallen asleep within 20-30 minutes instead of 1-2 hours!!,I have been using headspace for 5+ years now. Meditation every day leverages the power of compound interest. Done consistently over time will have life changing effects. It will not only benefit you but your loved ones. The one piece of my self care I never skip on is my daily headspace.,Aloha. This app is awesome. Never knew much about meditation and how it helps with stress. Being a father and a firefighter brings on a lot of stress sometimes. This app has helped me learn meditation and it\\'s helped me improve my over all mood and also helped me deal with some anxiety and I\\'ve been getting better sleep thank you headspace. 🤙🏽,This app has helped me so much through my life. Because if this app I have learned how to mediate, think and process my emotions instead of being controlled by them, and (arguably the most important part) it’s helping me be more mindful not just for myself, but for others too. I highly recommend this app.,Lately I have been feeling stressed out. My parents recommended me to start mediation. I have looked for some apps for guidance for meditation and found this one. It has different sessions for mediation. It helps a lot when feeling negative or stressed. It teaches how to mediate. Overall, I think this is a good mediation app.,Every single person needs more headspace than what they currently have in their lives. This program has changed my life in many ways for the better, and could even be recognized as something that has saved my life. Thank you to all at Headspace.,I love Headspace.

I have tried other mediation apps before but there’s something about this one that I prefer and always come back to.,Headspace is been in my life for a few years however it really changed my life in 2020.  The app helped me through a year of changes, grief and doubts.  I am now proud to say that I can’t function without it, it’s the first thing I do In the morning and the last thing I do before bed.\\nThank you Headspace,By far my favorite mindfulness app yet. I’ve tried what feels like all of the mindfulness apps over the years but keep coming back o this one. Andy’s voice and audible guidance is spot of for mindful relaxation and rewiring. The amount of course options is endless. Truly something for everyone,I have been charged $140 in one day for this app. However I do not have a subscription. I just verified this by looking at my subscriptions in my account and headspace does not exist! \\nThe reason why? Because I canceled it at the end of my trial. Yet they are charging me for double accounts! \\nZero trust in this company. \\nAvoid at all costs\\nReport any fraudulent charges and file complaint. I’m sick and tired of companies stealing my money. I will continue to pursue this until full restitution is made.,Recommended, especially for teachers and high stress jobs. Continued practice has helped me to start becoming more aware of when I get distracted or to notice my feelings change in my daily life. This app, with guided meditation, visualizations, walking, and sleeping, has helped me get in touch with an inner peace even in chaotic times.,I tried to see what functions this app had. Realized immediately that I needed to pay to access most of the content and deleted it after 5 minutes. I just got charged $75 for an annual subscription even though this app was on my phone for 5 minutes. This is a an awful app. I couldn’t even get back in to the app to see what was wrong, and it’s impossible to find the info on subscription charges or status of my “subscription” which I never agreed to.,If you struggle with a hyperactive mind at night this app has great short (customizable) meditations and exercises for bedtime. \\n\\nI set my timer for 10mins and to be honest I am OUT before the meditation is over! I have been waking up feeling refreshed and without needing an alarm clock. \\n\\nWould love to see an extension (?) for laptop and Apple TV.,I have been using Headspace seriously for about a Month now and am loving the daily wake up. Really starts my day off well! The partnership with the Lincoln Center dancing has been awesome 👏 Today I learned some Flamenco- my husband was duly impressed 💗\\nThank you for creating a positive start to my day!,I don’t typically review apps but this one has really made an impact on me.  The app is easy to use and seems to reach me where I am.  They are thoughtful sessions and manageable topics.  Very easy to use!  I also like that it keeps track of use and accountability since that makes be feel even more engaged.,I use to love my morning routine where I listen to Andy’s talk on podcast and spend 30 mins of meditation on the app. But since the podcast  and some of the meditation practices switched to Eve (not that I have anything against Eve), I quit the podcast and have been unsuccessfully trying to find other programs on the app. I really like Andy and I hope he’s not trying to quit.,Headspace has undoubtedly become my antidote to modern life. The app is so easy to use based on what I need in my life at any given moment, and the videos are extremely approachable to understand. I cannot speak highly enough of this platform and the power to heal and re-balance the body & mind.,I appreciate the small app size, play/ pause control of basic meditations from lock screen, the different recording lengths, the Sleepcasts with the audio mix control, and lo-fi music (thank you), and dark mode (love it, but an on/ off switch could be good). The price is alright, but may be a little high for some.,I feel so much calmer now then ever! (Especially cause I have ADHD, anxiety, and a little of depression) It really helps me walk through the steps and realize there is so much you can do with just a little meditation and time. You can learn to relax, accomplish goals, sleep better and so much more in just 15 (or less) minuets a day!!,The money I spent on this app was 100% worth it. This app is incredible and I recommend it to everyone, whether you regularly deal with stressors or if your life is fairly balanced. No matter who or where you are in life currently the habits this app gives you will benefit you long term :),After years of owning an iPhone and numerous apps, this is the first time I feel the urge to write a review about an app! Headspace has helped me tremendously through the most difficult time of my live. I struggle with severe anxiety. Andy - I can’t thank you enough for being such an inspiration.,I have not been very good at meditation in the past. Headspace meditations have helped me turn that around. The great 1 minute videos for tools and techniques are fun and easy to wrap my head around. The longer meditations are very relaxing and available on so many topics. Thanks, Headspace, I am hooked on your vibe! Pamela,I had no idea how to mediate when I started, and this app walks you through the whole process - plus, it’s fun and informative! The daily new mediations keep the content fresh, there are so many series that relate to my life, and it’s great for my son to help him fall asleep. Bottom line - life changing!,Love the way it streamlines the process of meditation and makes it accessible to anyone. It does an excellent job of teaching the core skills for meditation, and teaching you how to use what you learn in your everyday life. Highly recommend for anyone looking to find some piece of mind and just be happier.,I’m not kidding. Download this! You’ll love it and you won’t regret it. I’m a student so I get it for 10$ a month. And I use it everyday sometimes twice a day. There’s thousands of meditations on here. Mindful Workouts. But my two personal favorites are the sleep casts (bedtime stories) and the wake up videos!,After trying to meditate on my own for many years, Headspace helped me cultivate a daily practice. I’ve now used it almost every day for several years. The app has a wide selection of meditations and durations. It’s is reliable and easy to use. And I’m fortunate that my company pays for the subscription.,This is really great for learning to meditate. I’ve gotten A LOT out of it and I couldn’t be more grateful for the peace I’ve gained. The app functionality is a little underwhelming. It’s sorted, which is great. And I can search for a specific topic. But you can’t mark them for later. I wish I could just click a button to review later.,This app makes daily meditation possible for me. When I’m exhausted and I feel like I can’t sit still for 20 minutes on my own, this app has a way of “tricking” me into doing that very same thing. Sometimes, finding the smooth path in my life involves tricking my clever and devious brain. This app is a great life hack,I love how each instructor has their own unique offering in their tone of voice. But as a whole this app allows you to easy access a meditative space with a huge variety of meditation needs. From anger to a simple daily practice with variations in time as well. Thank you Headspace,Using this app is the one of the best things I’ve ever done on this phone to help myself and those around me. This app offers many different ways to balance, become more aware, and let the body rest and recover. Unpretentious and playful, yet powerfully direct and based on ancient meditation practice.,Headspace for me is life changing. Andy’s voice is so soothing and calming that even in my most anxious moments I am able to unwind and relax. So thankful for this and for the year free because this has been the most difficult year for us financially and business wise with these shutdowns in California affecting our business.,I love love love Headspace. It is the best meditation out there because it has courses that build on one another, rather than having to select a one off meditation each time. It’s kept me accountable and has deepened my mindfulness practice so much. 10/10 would recommend. Has truly changed my life,Signed up for headspace during the pandemic and it is the best! Their sleep meditation really helps my husband to sleep. I have used some of their meditation courses and those have helped too. Lastly they’ve got some white noise (like Ocean time) that helps our baby sleep as well. Win win for all of us :),This is a very good, well-produced product. The meditations are excellent and genuinely beneficial. I had no idea there was a child section when I purchased this, but now my seven-year-old daughter and I listen to a meditation for her every night before she drifts off. It is teaching her a real life skill.,I’m so grateful for Headspace. My husband died in February 2020. Shortly after his death everything was shut down due to Covid-19.  I was grieving and the loneliness was unbearable.  I did the counseling course.  It helped me so much, Andy’s voice was like listening to a friend.  I’m still lonely and grieving but I’m looking forward to the future. Thank you Headspace.,Loved using Headspace for meditation as well as a sleep aid for months. I have noticed marked improvement in my stress and anxiety levels partially due to the resources on this app. That said, it’s clear that Andy and Headspace are choosing to sell themselves out to companies that have nothing to do with meditation. Music and workouts in a meditation app? What? Stay true to yourself. Eh, I guess it’s just business.,I love this app for many reasons. This helps me with stress and it is amazing. It’s in my routine wake up listen to this then so whatever then around lunch time I would listen to any other\\none and lastly before I sleep. I probably use this app more then most apps on my phone.

I love how easy it is to get started with a new course after you’ve been gone for a while. I appreciate that they keep me motivated by showing me stats such as the number of minutes I’ve meditated or the number of days in a row that I’ve meditated.,This app saved my life. As a provider working in covid, I never have time to see a therapist but these little 5 minute meditations have helped me stay healthy and sane! I am so grateful they gave it for free to health care providers, but even if I had to pay it would be worth what it has given back to me!,This is such a perfectly set up app. Everything about it is peaceful, calm, deliberate , and organized into logical steps. I find some other meditation apps to be cluttered, chaotic, intense in graphics , etc to gain your attention. I find this to be the opposite of meditation. Headspace is a perfect “balance of balance” of ideas and practice. Very healing !,This has been a huge shift for the positive in my daily life, and from something so simple as sitting quietly fir a short time every day. Great thoughts from Andy that definitely have helped calm my restless mind, and keep a steady focus through the day instead of feeling depleted after half of it is done.,I am just beginning but I can honestly say that I have moments of peace that I was not aware of before.  I view this as a journey with many curves, the destination is a greater peace and the ability to know when I need to pull back or when I need to move one step further.,I have been meditating for a while, the first app I ever use was headspace which gave me a huge introduction to meditation in a very gentle way, after that I tried a few others apps but I always coming back to headspace because of its simplicity and very warming way of meditating \\nThank you Andy and all the HEADSPACE crew!!!,I’ve had headspace for two years now and I couldn’t imagine life without it. It has taught me so much and helped me find so much clarity. I love the everyday wake up, the courses, and the Move section they added is a wonderful addition. Will be renewing again for next year!,I love this app! Lots of courses to target issues that may be clouding your mind. I used this everyday for a short 10 minutes and found it tremendously helpful. Things that used to bother me, just roll off my back now. Download it and don’t look back!,This app is such an incredible tool for those uninitiated to meditation. I was searching for resources on how to embark on this journey and the use of the daily guided meditations is such a good entry way to understanding what it is to sit! So many amazing guides and different focus points I can’t speak highly enough. Use it every day.,Everyone has something they use to decompress and relax after a long day.

Highly recommend every try it every day for 30 days before saying meditation isn’t for you!,I love this app. I struggle with insomnia, anxiety and depressive tendencies, and as a almost 13 year old girl, it’s really hard.

Thank you, Headspace, for making this app a reality. 👏🏼,Mindfulness and meditation are scientifically proven practices to manage struggles with mental health. I was first introduced to these things by a therapist as a tool to address my chronic anxiety and depression. Since then, my ability to cope has only gotten better. Thanks to Headspace I have an easy, approachable way to find deeper joy in life.,The Wake Up used to be the highlight of my morning. I started watching the peaceful videos combined with breathing exercises and short meditations during quarantine in spring ‘20. They started by removing the meditations, then only showed the peaceful videos once a week, and now it seems they’ve removed the breathing exercises. I will really miss the old Wake Up. 😢 I also wish more of your content had captions for the Deaf/HH folks.,Headspace is helping me create my meditation routine and stick to it. There are so many different meditations to choose from and new ones everyday. I am in a completely different space after a year of near daily use. So easy to us and customizable to any routine,I never write app reviews, but I had to for Headspace.  It was an app my therapist suggested to me when I had no idea where to start.  It makes meditation simple, calm, and easy for someone like me who stresses out about doing even meditation correctly.\\n\\nI love how many options there are of different states if mind that they can help talk you through rebalancing yourself.\\n\\nI have recommended this app to every friend who mentions how they want to get started in meditating.  I would have given up if I didn’t have such a simple and colorful guide like this.\\n\\nEven the design of the app is so calming.  I love it.,I really love the recent changes including the Today design/experience and dark background! There may be a couple bugs in setting up the meditation and bedtime reminders from the dark mode switch.

But this app is good I advocate for it whenever I can. My anxiety and depression levels have dramatically changed for the better. Thanks headspace. Your team has made my life one I love living.,This app i thought was only for sleep meditations and it made me feel limited on what I could or could not meditate on, but then I started trying other meditations and had some that were better than others. Anyway point is with Andy as my guide and others there for me too I feel perfectly satisfied and mainly, positive and calm. “Wow headspace!”,Meditation has changed my life! It’s been almost five years since I joined Headspace after seeing an article in Parade Magazine. My blood pressure has dropped significantly and I find I feel less stressed! I look forward to the time I set aside each morning and l know it sets the tone for my day.,From the variety of meditation experiences and courses to the focus music and daily offerings to the sleepcasts.- this is the whole package! The best thing is the beautiful energy that comes through in every aspect. You know this group, the creators if this app and content truly care. \\n.,I have tried a couple of meditation apps, but headspace of by far my favorite. Simple, clear, fun and engaging it’s such an important tool. I have all my clients get headspace, because it’s such an important part of their practice. Change your thinking and you can change your life.,i’ve recently started using this app again with its new features and i am amazed by it. it truly has helped me relax and refocus my mind. i cant sleep without it ! although, i do wish not everything on there you had to buy the subscription,I definitely recommend this app it has helped me sleep and meditate, 3 different voices you can listen too and hundreds of sessions that really do help. I use headspace whenever I can! I mean it really has been proven that meditation  once a day is super super healthy headspace helps so much and is really relaxing,Whenever I downloaded Headspace, I thought it would be free and I honestly think it should be free. I know you guys want to make money off of it, but it’s a app for meditation. I know it probably isn’t ideal, but I would rather do one payment of $5-$15 than 70 dollars a year or 13 dollars every month. Sure there might be a 7-day free trial, but I don’t think it really matters. Thinking about this problem makes me have even more frustration and it is now hard for me to meditate thinking about how I can’t finish.,This is so much more than a meditation app.  There are so many resources for healthy living including exercise, mindful eating and just great information on al those emotions that daily get our way.  As a psychologist, I can hear the lessons are well rooted in sound research.  I highly recommend.,I’ve loved Headspace for awhile now, but I love the new layout even more. It’s nice to open the app and not really have to “think” about which meditation to do; I have a layout of my day and options. I can already tell it will make me more likely to meditate. Please keep this layout!,Have used the Headspace app for a year and a half and I feel its a fantastic app for beginners. It has a very progressive slope which can help one ramp up their meditation practice.\\nThe only con I feel is it does not incentivize the user to meditate regularly, which could help the user be more regular with their practice.,Headspace was a great place for me to begin my meditation practice. It is simple, easy to use as an app and will help the user begin their practice. I’ve been using it in my practice for five years. For those who want to go deeper than calming the mind, into broadening our experience of consciousness, eventually you’ll have to look elsewhere.,I use headspace because I had it a long time ago to help me sleep because I have problems with sleeping but the thing is that I need to pay for it and I can only listen to two of the sleep things over and over and they get boring so please but more sleep meditate podcast for free not all of the but like the indigo gallery and the Landry mat one,I saw headspace on ads for years but never got it because I thought I knew how to meditate so I didn’t think it was worth paying for it , but once I gave it a shot it’s a real game changer I’ve been using it everyday to help me stay focused and calm throughout the day.,I hit the “try free” button and was immediately charged for the full year. I guess it’s because I signed up for a free trial in the past that I had forgotten about? I assumed (reasonably I think) that if I was ineligible for a free trial, the app would have told me that and wouldn’t have repeatedly advertised one to me. Like I said, the button I pressed literally said “Try Free.” Pretty bad start to a business relationship for an app to explicitly tell me I’m not going to be charged and then to immediately charge me $70.,Headspace has definitely helped me. From helping me to fall asleep at night and helping me to keep my calm to waking up. Headspace reminded me it’s okay for your mind to wander off, but in the end it will always come back, and mind, body, and speech, are one again. Headspace is a lifesaver, and I’d be lost without having headspace.,Headspace truly changed the way I think about meditation - therefore, has changed my life. It made a practice that I was struggling to get into easier. I was actually was able to sit in a non-judgements space with myself and WANT to meditate everyday. I recommend headspace to all my fitness clients.,Had a free trial and loved it. For a new iPhone 11 and couldn’t log in. Couldn’t reset password. Didn’t recognize my account, but charged me for the yearly membership. Logged several help desk messages trying to get it to restore and low and behold, double charged my Apple account but still would let me log in! Ended up disputing with my credit card company and going with another app. Too bad but who has the time for this?!! No thanks!,My wife and I have been practicing meditation for over 365 continuous days using the app. Andy does a wonderful job of explaining and guiding. I recommend Headspace to anyone who is beginning a meditation practice and also to those who have been meditating for some time. All the feedback is really positive!,This helps so much because school is always so stressful because so many assignments about things I didn’t even learn yet. Because of this I was able to throw my stress in the trash and be able to do more things without being stressed.,I have been using headspace for more than 8 years now. Great investment especially they keep updating the app with different modules/ courses which fits everyone. \\n\\nThe app helps a lot in normal daily meditation or during difficult times. Love love love,My first few meditation sessions went well... except for intrusive thoughts of “this isn’t my idea of being productive!”\\nAnd ironically I begin to understand *that’s* the point: remove yourself from the ‘productive’ world; move yourself mentally and physically inward, away from involvement with the outside world. Say ‘hello’ to yourself, “how are ya’ doing in there?”\\nAnd listen for the answer.,I have subscribed to the family plan, I have used this off and on for the last couple years and it has really helped me during my most stressful moments. The body AND the mind need excersize and rest. I encourage you to give this a try. Remember, there is a blue sky above the clouds!,I\\'ve been using Headspace nearly 4 years and it has secured the habit of daily meditation into my life (after numerous previous attempts). Among the many things that I love about Headspace, I\\'ve noticed that it makes me feel like I\\'m not meditating alone. Hurray for Andy and his team. Thank you!!!!!!!!,I love this app but I wish you could stack / make a playlist. For example, I like to listen to a 5 or 10 minute wind down before listening to a sleep cast. It would be nice to have a playlist to just hit play and be guided off to sleep.,The thing about this app that I really can\\'t handle is the voices they use for the meditations and sleep casts. They are not at all soothing and many of them have this weird gargle-y scratchy tone in their voice that makes me want to scream and cry at the same time. Working for the horrible corporation of Starbucks gives me this app for free though, so I\\'ll use it until I can\\'t handle working for one of corporate America\\'s demons any longer.,This app has been super helpful! I’d love if there was more content supporting the working mom. How to balance work stress and kids, and meditations to help relax from work stress while pumping, and other issues working moms struggle with.,I never rate apps, but in a particularly difficult time of life, I tried my first meditation and I had an almost spiritual experience with one of the meditations. I felt empowered and free and lifted out of my burdens. I’m sold. I subscribed immediately. I can’t wait to meditate every day in the future.,I was surprised to see how much content is on here. There’s sessions for everything from stress management to working out to sleep. It’s easy to get in a few minutes every day to get yourself grounded. I enjoy the sleepcasts. I turn one on and I’m out in minutes.,Since I started using this app a week ago, my anxiety levels are lower and I feel more in control. I highly recommend this app. It’s great for mindfulness and it has enough free stuff, you don’t have to pay for it unless you want to.,I am so grateful to the headspace team for creating this app. I feel lucky to have found it because it has helped me find clarity in my life like nothing else has. I highly recommend this mediation app to anyone looking to start their practice or find more consistency’.,As we go through life, we learn it contains intermittent chaos. But through the ups and downs, the gains and losses, I can always turn to Headspace as a stable, loving, caring practice. I love the variety and the wisdom, and the knowledge that other people are engaged in this practice, gives me hope for the world.,The sleep meditation is great but when you play the audio, the screen is bright white and blinding. Not relaxing when trying to get to sleep or especially annoying when trying to get back to sleep. Would be great if it could be dark like some of the sleep casts or sleep soundscapes.,The meditation and  information that Andy shares with me is making  a big difference in my emotional life and in turn for those I live and interact with ...especially with my husband. We have never been happier or kinder to each other.\\nThanks you!\\nMaripat Monterubio,I’ve been doing yoga and meditations for 20 years before my husband mention this app. I love it. All the programs they have are useful during many stages and situations of our lives. It brought my meditation practice to another level. \\nTry it. You won’t retreat it.,I came into this an angry person but through this app I was better able to uncover and see this anger and be able to let it pass naturally instead of letting it bog me down. It’s super easy to get into and genuinely walks you through it.,This is the only app I pay for and the only app I have every reviewed. Andy is a great teacher and the packs provide nice variety and choice. 10 minutes today can make an enormous change as to how you walk through life.,I have depression, anxiety, OCD and a terrible time getting to sleep. Headspace helps me out with all of those. I’ve been using Headspace for a couple of years now and I especially like their Sleepcasts. I also really like the Move category for a quick morning yoga routine.,Headspace has helped me in so many ways, through many times in my life where I felt it was hard to keep my nervous system calm and my head straight. The tools they teach are easily applicable to everyday life. I’m very grateful for this app and the guided meditations.,Before I didn’t realize how beneficial meditation was to my life before I started using this app. I first watched the documentary and learned about how to meditate. And then this app presented itself and I took of with it. Very useful for those looking for different ways to benefit themselves mentally and emotionally!!,I’ve been using headspace for years. It’s only gotten better. The meditations are so accessible and easy to follow. I meditated for years before starting headspace, and sometimes still on my own, but I’ll continue to use the app for as long as I can!,Headspace has allowed me to start my day off and end my day on the right note, getting in touch with myself and enjoying my own company. It has allowed me to relax when other methods have failed, as well as ease any anxiety I have in a healthy and natural way,I can definitely feel the difference when I am not able to mediate.  The soundscape recordings to help with sleep and the daily course meditation selections are spot on with specific challenges I’ve been working through.,I’m so well pleased with this app. The creators, the content and everything in between from the daily reminders and inspiration. I haven’t found anything better! 10/10 recommend this app, it’s worth the investment. You are worth the investment 💓,I have struggled with anxiety most of my life. Headspace has helped me to develop more peace and calmness in my daily life. It is so easy to use and my life has been better with it than without out. Thank you Andy and headspace for a wonderful tool to improve my daily appreciation for life.,Headspace is a daily fixture in my life. The meditation has helped me get through the passing of my parents and supported my current successful relationship with anxiety.  The focus playlists keep me in the zone. The morning Wake up is how I like to stat my day and sleep music ends my day. Thank you Headspace🌻,I search throughout the app, and saw I only had a few options to listen to. This was fine, until I realized all except one were voices. I wanted to turn the voices off, but that is not something you can do with the app. So listen to the same music every night. My point is, very much more powerful if you buy headspace plus.    Please change this.,While the app is useful, it really is overpriced for what is essential repetitive instructions to focus on your breath and be present and non judge mental to the happenings during this time.\\n\\nThis would be well worth a $30 initial cost but paying over $1000 for it, based on continued use for 10 years (I mean I have had 12 years of iPhones) is really crazy and a cash grab.,I have used Headspace off and on for four or five years. It’s never been more important to my well-being than it is now. And, the app keeps innovating content that adds to the scope of ways it can be useful to mind and body.,I have been doing this app on and off for a few weeks, but I know if I do it everyday, I will be able to stay more calm and relaxed, thanks,Headspace is great... only for people who are willing to pay. There’s barely anything you can do without paying. Everything on the app is good, but like I said, you need to pay for like 7/8 of it. I would give it one star but I gave it 2 because the meditations are really good. With all that being said, I will be deleting it soon. Thank you for reading. I hope this helped you!,On the positive side I find it very useful to use this app. On the negative side, I never received a trial period but was instead charged the full price immediately. When I contacted customer service to cancel it, they couldn’t find my account. So I needed to use the app because I was so dang frustrated with the purchase. I don’t plan to renew my subscription but the app works very well,I finished the course on the free plan and I loved it. You get 10 days of 10 different meditations with 3 instructors plus other fun videos. I’m still working on building the habit so I’m taking the course again but with a different instructor this time.,I am SO deeply inspired & grateful for the mini-series of content launched focusing on how to overcome various traumas due to social unrest & injustice... A brilliant example of beautiful actions companies can take that are inspiring the benevolent evolutions happening in our world. THANK YOU for this corporate accountability, Headspace!! Love your work!!,Headspace was offered free to healthcare workers at the peak of 2020 last year. I always wanted to try it, so here was my chance. It changed my life. I mean that sincerely. I crave sessions with andy and it has helped center me, teach me how to decompress, and de-escalate the emotions I was feeling that were taking control of my life.,I’m only three days into the beginner course. I’d like it a lot more if the teacher (Eva) paused between sentences, but instead you have no time to process what she said before she’s onto the next instruction. \\n\\nExample: “Now let your mind do whatever it wants to do now take a deep breath now feel your body in your chair now congratulations you’re done.” It’s actually stressful! PAUSE BETWEEN INSTRUCTIONS. Give me a minute or even 30 seconds to try what you just asked me to do.\\n\\nI’d change teachers, but the other woman has a lisp and I don’t like the English guy’s voice. I’m being overly picky, I know. \\n\\nI guess it’s just not the meditation app for me.,This is one of the few apps I will pay for, because it’s not an app. It’s having mental health. The app is just the interface - the convenient method through which we access this content. Thank you for your teaching.,I am an Infectious Disease physician and many of my patients describe to me what is all too familiar, the monkey mind. I encourage my patients to meditate, and it doesn’t matter which app or book or silence one uses, what matters is that one meditates. It’s just that Andy has does a good job of making it approachable.,Overall a great app.\\n\\nPositives: Great meditations, soothing speakers, great visuals. I like that they keep a tracker of how you feel over the course of a month. Additional articles to read.\\n\\nNegatives: A lot of content is locked behind a subscription. I get it but, they give you just a little in terms of free. I’m talking one session, two tops.\\n\\nOthers of Note: I’m stuck listening to Kevin Hart when I run. I don’t personally like the man for a racist birthday party he held for his son (I’m indigenous). I wish I could have options to listen to other speakers like in guided meditation in their application. When I think “mindful runs” I don’t go straight to Kevin Hart of all people. Makes me want to stay in.,this app has gotten me through some really rough panic attacks, esp during quarentine. there’s this really amazing feature on the home page that’s called the panic button, and it is the best grounding tool i’ve ever used.

But Headspace has made me realize that that is perfectly okay and helped me relax and lean into the uncertainty of life and the future.,If I could I would give this app 10 Stars!

I have been using it for two years and love it. The amount of rich content is endless.,I love headspace it helps me calm down so much etc. But i hate that you have to pay now or have some stupid subscription i’m on my free trial right now because i don’t have the money to pay for the subscription but the app is really great rather than all the things i can’t do cuz i have to have the “premium”,I have meditated on and off but this is great. It’s guided by wonderful people that know and understand the process. It has been incredibly useful to me and my morning routine and the positive change in my life is becoming more evident as I continue on this journey.,For PE I need a meditation app, I’ve already tried the app Calm and some others, so I downloaded this! Well all of the apps I’ve gone to make me put in my email AND I can’t find my heart beat on the app unless I pay money. I feel that everyone should be able to control their body with a little help.

I’ve just started but that is the immediate effect I’ve noticed.,I used to suffer with anxiety which manifested by having episodes of choking. I think it was panic attacks.

I mean, I love the story, but it wasn’t what I was looking for, just wanted to report that bug. Thanks!,My days are much more calm and mindful when I have headspace as a daily companion.

I use it every morning to have a focused, well rested mind.,This is a app that should help with the facts of life and it does it’s job good but I feel as if it’s a little bit weird and I like it but it but there are some ins and outs and it’s iffy\\n\\nYea\\nOk\\nBye,I love headspace and I love what they do, but I’m not willing to pay money to meditate.

I haven’t seen anything as simple as headspace.,Not a bad app, but insight timer is such a better deal. It upsets me a bit that they claim this stuff is to improve lives etc, but it’s really just to get as much money as possible. Otherwise it’d be fairly priced,I’m struggling to cancel the subscription, I thought I canceled it, turned out they charged me another $75, oh my god, I just sent and email to customer service, after this, I am gonna stop using the app for good.,I use this app every day and love it.

I only wish Dora did the Basics 2 courses. Can’t say enough!,Friendly, welcome. No nonsense introduction. But after 6 mos., need something new because it becomes repetitive.,I LOVE HEADSPACE. I have been using it for years. In 2020 I began to use it even more and here is my wishlist:\\n\\nPlease make it so that we can combine the daily pre-amble with semi guided or unguided meditations!!\\n\\nPlease consider incorporating a course with a bells/chimes instead of voices for semi guided meditations. \\n\\nThat is all. Thank you.,My favorite time is spent being mindful with the use of this extraordinary app.,Thank you head space for giving me the best sleep I love all the mediation in the app,I used to sleep uncomfortably, but with this app I fall asleep in 15 minutes!,Sometimes it doesn\\'t work and won\\'t start a meditation.,That was good but it wasn’t really enough of it,This app makes me relaxed and calm. Whenever I’m stressed I will listen to the soft voice and I will calm down,This app will give you more peace of mind than railing an ounce of horse tranquilizers in an open field.,Offering nothing but one option seems cheap and frustrating. Need more than one choice to call it an app with options,I love this app, I feel so calm. But I hate how u have to pay for some stuff I never have bc I am doing great with out it but I would like to see what the other stuff does,This app has helped me breath much better.,I can’t hear Andy during the meditation.  He talks so low and quiet I can’t hear what he says until it’s at the end.  I find I have to turn the volume up and down so often that I lose focus of the meditation.,Life changing. Give it a try, even if it’s just for 5 days. ❤️,Can’t start or end my day without it,Headspace helps me frame a practice and improve each day.,Such an amazing and complete app. ItHas been very beneficial to not only me but my family as well!,headspace is such a wonderful learning tool! starting meditation is not an easy thing. i love that headspace gives you the ability to practice with help while still gaining the wonderful benefits of meditation. i’ve learned so much while using this app.,I would recommend definitely calming and grounding,Almost none of it comes with the app and you pay for basically all of it. This app is unfair and people who want to meditate don’t want their money taken as the price of doing it and this will make them more stressed therefore contradicting the apps purpose. It stinks,Along with my therapist, this app gave me a sense of awareness and incredible relaxation. It taught me to be calmer over my body,This app is versatile, fresh and wellness focused with a clean, approachable and attractive aesthetic. I love it! I have been using it for a long time and it pleasantly gets better and better with time. It really helps with anxiety, sleep trouble, anger and now so many other areas of challenge in life. I think there’s something for everyone—regardless of background—to benefit from in the app. My partner and I enjoy doing meditations and Move exercises together. They seem to always be adding more and improving in ways that I previously had silently wished they would. As for possible improvements, I’d really like to be able to “shuffle” or choose a random sleepcast, specifically. Also, it would be nice if I could rewind the sleepcast, as sometimes I miss the beginning or certain parts while I’m settling in, or still have stuff on my mind from the day and don’t want to go through the whole wind down exercise again. Another suggestion—and this may just be an issue with my older Apple TV—if I could airplay the video along with the audio (Move exercises, The Wake Up) that would be fantastic as right now only audio plays on the tv while I have to watch the fitness instructor from the phone. One last thing, how about Apple Watch compatibility? That would be delightful and I would use it even more often. Any small flaws or teensy inconveniences aside, it’s still well worth the small fee to support the people who make this great service available to us.,Ever since I started headspace I’ve fallen asleep in five minutes or so. With the rainy day antiques it’s amazing!!,Headspace is a true focus on the practice of mindfulness. Instructional and guided for long term results. Not a series of licensed opportunities for celebrities or influencers like Calm.,I want to be able to see my streaks on a calendar and have more detailed insights on how much I meditated by day of the week. \\n\\nAlso, send me “streak in danger” notifications to keep me coming back!,Headspace is a great support in jumpstarting my practice of mindfulness and mediation. Not sure how I’d do it otherwise, so thanks!,I tried Headspace, I thought it would help but sleep or something but i was wrong, I dont know if I haven\\'t looked through it enough and I dont know if im the only one who doesn\\'t like it, but I dont know who would spend money on here...,Great App. Possibly getting a little too overwhelming for a meditation app, but at the same time the features they’ve added are nice.

I can’t buy it!,Current job is causing stress. Unable to stay focused. Sleep is a problem as well.,I have been using it for years.,Helps with pain, focus and sleep for me. Long term solution gota keep at it for it to work!,Used to love this app but now you have to pay for literally every meditation they have except for like one.,i used to love headspace. i’ve had the app for years. i didn’t see a point in paying for the premium version, because everything i listened to was free. i used headspace to help me sleep, but within the past few months the sounds i listened to now require payment. i still don’t see a point in paying for it, so i’m just gonna delete the app and find something else.,Stick to meditation to truly understand the benefits. May not be dramatic to say that it is life changing,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️it gives the perpose you expect,I love this app, I’ve been using it since 2018 & it’s helped my Anxiety & Scattered mind tremendously.,I paid for a full year subscription and got locked out of my account with no way to get back on it and no viable options presented to help with the situation. So so so disappointed,Young man Downlad this app it will change your life.,Thanks. My 26 year old put this on my phone. Learning to meditate.,Best app I pay for hands down,It’s such a good app! Please be patient and loving towards it and you will see results. Very good,This is a great app, but the options are very limited if you don’t pay in app purchases.,I really enjoyed this exercise. It gave me a sense of peace.

It has been going on for weeks. Otherwise, the app is great.,It’s okay, I just hate the fact that every single “sleep cast” sound is for “vip” or “premium” i want to listen to it freely. And the actually free sleep cast ones are absurd. Don’t get this if you don’t wanna waste money.,This app ( Andy) has helped me more than I can ever say! I love it and use it daily.,I use it everyday and what a wonderful tool to help with my meditation.,I’m a kid and I love this app I downloaded this app because I have a very difficult time going to sleep and this app is THEEE BEESSSTT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND 😁🙋\\u200d♀️,I have had a subscription to this app for a very long time. I first started using it for sleep.  I could never fall asleep... I would toss and turn for hrs, sometimes all night and not even get a min of sleep. This was extremely frustrating and it was affecting many aspects of my life in a negative way.  I have chronic back pain, and I could never get comfortable, so I thought about this pain all night. My mind racing, knowing that I had work in the morning and I was just miserable.  So, I started using the wind downs.  I incorporated that with a beginners course on meditation.  After some time and practice, I was beginning to see real improvement.  Then I added the sleep stories, I didn’t think they would work at first, because I believed that the story would have me too focused on the story and not fall asleep. Again, after a week or two, I was falling asleep before the story ended.  Then I did the pain course...to help me understand my relationship with pain.  It did wonders. Over months I was dedicating at least one time a day to meditation.  I also have anxiety, and have been working on that.  But there is so much more on this app. Yoga, healthy eating, music, and a lot of helpful info and meditations.  I have tried other apps while using this one. Some were pretty good and some just weren’t for me. This app is honestly an app I can’t live without.  I love it!  I am living a healthier lifestyle and also sleeping so much better. I recommend this app to ANYONE & everyone.  They add new courses and different aspects to it all the time.  I will NEVER cancel this app.  I have begun to look at life different. My mood is more positive, I am focusing more, and I encourage anyone looking for a place to start a meditation journey to start with this app.  There’s so much information and I can’t go a day without it.  It’s the best out there!,Always something new. Continuously engaging.,It’s my first time using this app and I don’t know what to do but it is kind of relaxing.I am tired so many it’s just me that is making me sleep .,Its really goo\\'s but it always asking for money to unlock it٫ its really annoying when im or somebody is trying to listen to rain but it asks for a membership! this app is great but too much.,The greatest app you can have on your phone.,This app eases into meditations and is a great place to start. And even stay:),Helpful app!

DEFINITELY worth the cost!,The guided meditations are rushed. I don’t like any of the coaches. Seems like they are focused on quick 2 minute meditations during a workday. The app has limited features.,This app literally changed my life thank you,I like the fact that the meditation is less guided.,My teacher introduced this to me! I love it especially when I go to sleep!!:)❤️so good!,Needs more mom related options,It is an awesome app for as I am a child I can not go to sleep and I have tried some stuff on here and still Can’t go to sleep so I gave it a 3 star rating \\n\\nLove 💕 Bella,I love headspace but I can’t use my app today- even restarting my phone doesn’t change anything I just keep getting the message “internal server error”,i can\\'t thank headspace and the entire team enough for allowing me to channel my inner mindfulness. to create real lasting peace with my head and the variety of things in it. thank you headspace,I love the app, but many meditation courses only have two narrators, some only have one male narrator! Please have Dora narrate more courses and add more women’s voices. As a woc, I feel safer with woc narrators.,I started meditating yesterday and I’ve already won a game of Pac-Man 99.,I love this app in the first session it was soooo calming and relaxing I definitely recommend😊,(So i can use this app with magic keyboard) Right now it can only operate in portrait mode.,Finally able to meditate in a productive, consistent way!,My son bought me Headspace for my birthday 🥳 last year after I had talked with him about a perceived crisis I was having. My son is 38, I am 68 and we are very close. He said “do you meditate?” I thought then said “well no I wouldn’t know where to start.” When my birthday rolled around he told me he purchased a year of Headspace so I could learn to meditate. That is the most thoughtful gift 🎁 I have ever received. I was feeling like I was having a meltdown starting on the inside, so I started the impermanence process. My day starts better with the little bit of time I devote to myself. There are many issues I am working on and the more I examine the list in Headspace I see they have a session for each issue. I am certainly on a journey that is aiding me with the tools and skills to manage issues better. I use to have a difficult time getting to sleep and now I put on Rainday Antiques to help me sleep and I have yet to hear it to the end... I am sleeping very well. With the discipline of having the breathing to center me and give me a moment or two to get a perspective rather than react I feel much more in control. I am so not there yet (where ever there is 😂) and I feel that Headspace will always have a session for me on this wonderful journey my son gifted me.  After a bit of Headspace I feel able to meet my day with the idea every day is a journey of something different and exciting to explore. I thank Headspace for being a wonderful part of my life’s journey.,Has great exercises and other features,Best use of my phone every day,The programs fit me like a “t.” It is a good friend who is always there.,Headspace has changed my life,I’m glad there’s woman voices being offered but it’s mostly white voices. That may be comforting for some but it makes it harder to focus for others. The voice of comfort and mindfulness, our mindfulness, doesn’t sound like them.,This app helps me to cultivate a sense of peace, one greater than I imagined possible.,While I like the product, their billing system is a pain to turn off if you set up automatic renewals, which resulted in unwanted charges.,This is the best app ever at first I was stressed now I feel Awsome relaxed after just 5 minutes!!!!!,Headspace’s meditation teachers taught me so much about mindfulness and I’ve been mediating afford two years as a high schooler. And Andy was a former Buddhist monk, so I learned sooo much about mindfulness that it’s improving my quality of life A LOT. There are so many things I want to say but I want to keep this short. Even though mediation sounds ‘dumb’ for some people, Headspace is the very opposite; it gives me mindfulness tips and follow up with a mediation, making the mindfulness lesson more memorable, and what I learned so far (and all of them are so freaking helpful) are: observe thoughts instead of reacting and getting carried away with them, if we’re reacting to thoughts we are keeping the emotion alive, adding more fuel to the fire; let’s thoughts come and go, with a gentle or effortless focus; having a daydream sense of mind let’s us take things less seriously and it gives us more freedom, and sooooo many more (I can’t remember all at the moment). But some improvements I’d want to see are: being able to review the daily mediations in the “Today” tab, because they are so freaking useful and I want to keep listening to them, I don’t want them to be just “daily”, I want it to exist in the library forever; another improvement is that it’s kind of expensive for high schoolers, and since I’m a high schooler and I think this app should be used more by students, I think it should have a reduced price for high schoolers as well (thankfully I got a free one-year trial and I’m waiting for the sale, because I’m paying using my own money).,It just brings so much value to my life.,I love this app and it helps me get to sleep every night 😴,Just what my wife and I need to start the day.,Headspace is awesome! It can really be a magical experience if you fully immerse yourself in the experience!,It would be helpful if our “journey” logged the duration and time of our meditation,My paid account won’t load with this newest update :( - the app times out and won’t verify my password —  so I can’t use the app at all because it requires you to log in.,I don’t know what else to say.,Great way to get into meditation,The more I meditate the more I feel my true self,This app is over all amazing for stress, or just being healthier with your mental health habits!,Headspace keeps me calm and when I need to and energetic when I need to be, I love this app.,The gift to oneself that keeps on giving!,Wonderful had me asleep in seconds,I was very stressed today. This helped calm me down.,This is my go to app. Great breadth and scope of the meditation world. Makes my life calmer and my attitude more compassionate.,Every time I listen I feel god heal me in some way🙌🏼🙏😩🌙🙈,I’m new to meditating and this helped me so much I recommend it:),Life changing if you let it,The ads are terrible and long. I hate that everything cost money but other then that it’s good.,As soon as an app becomes unusable because I can’t log in I 1) give it one star and 2) cancel my subscription.

Craptastic for people who aren’t dumb enough to believe in meditation.,I have heard of apps similar to this one before and figured I would give it a try to relax me since with finals are just around the corner and deadlines are getting closer. I decided to put my goal at reducing stress and anxiety and the first thing I got was  prompoted to a “Feeling overwhelmed” talk down to get myself relaxed and calm. The voice was not all that calming and relaxing, but he did have an accent that was very mesmorizing that helped let go of some tension. \\n\\nAfter setting some goals for myself Headspace created a list of things for me to accomplish throughout the day and the first thing was to take five deep breaths. What I loved about this was the music was very calming, but still had some upbeats it helped with when we were holding, breathing in, and exhaling. Another great component was there was a little face that would do the exercise with you and when you would inhale it would smile.\\n\\nThe way this app relates with anxiety and panic attacks is, I think this can be beneficial to help get our heart rates down, get us to focus on other things, and help us relax. I think this would be incredibly useful in situations of discomfort of nervousness, I know this would help me and many others. Breathing methods help center us, by doing the five breaths with the app helped me feel more in control and calm of what I was doing. I have shared this app with my family, as I know they have been going through some hard times lately and they could use something to relax and destress them. \\n\\nStress can be hard to manage, and a lot of the talking “podcasts” seem to help with trying to get you to let go or trying to find other things to distract ourselves with so we dont become too overwhelmed. Overall, I think this app has some benefits it helps calm you, center you, and puts you at peace. It certainly helped my anxiety be more managable while doing assignments and it helped me get in the right direction for the next couple of hours with my work and overall wellness. I can definitely see myself using this in a store to distract myself from my anxiety because this type of stuff can be grounding.,Get rid of Kevin Hart It’s absolutely stupid and does the opposite of getting rid of stress it left me aggravated to listen to it,My favorite meditation app!,Feels repetitive,don’t waste your time downloading unless you want to pay a ton of money for more than two or three videos,Game changer!!,I love it no cap,highly recommend,You’re welcome,Umm, maybe not for me.,It’s to hard the listen to they are so quiet!,Amazing app! Guided meditation, yoga, great quotes, sleep tunes. I love it :),Was thinking of giving it 1 star… below is why⬇️\\n\\nHeadspace is truly a wonderful app.\\nIt has evolved through time with new features made for every kind of person. New high quality content is constantly added. \\n\\nI started meditation and mindfulness through Andy’s book, “Headspace Guide To Meditation and Mindfulness” and it was a game changer. Eventually I downloaded the app and, sometime after, I started paying annual membership. I do so without regret because of what the app offers. The opportunity to access guided meditation by teachers such as Andy is incredible!!  Everyday life is a fight, the world is going fast, our lives as well…for me, the app has become an necessary aide for motivation and resources. \\n\\nPrecisely this is why I almost gave it 1 star. Everything is so magnificent it has generated dependency.  It is so good, that now it seems very difficult for me to meditate without it. It is as if I’ve lost my ability, will, and/or discipline to acquire headspace on my own. Makes sense? Maybe. Foreseeable? Most likely. Inevitable? Not really. Could be just me? Definitely. As of writing this comment, I will actively work to put in practice meditation and mindfulness on my own again.\\n\\nMy advice for anyone reading the review is to go for it. Try it out, learn the basics and reap the benefits !!!  but be careful to practice being present and dealing with your mind without having to use the app. I believe the app can’t become essential in our lives. Good luck !,I ‘lol love it so much,Not much in the free version,Title says it all,It’s awesome.,this app doesn’t send me notifications anymore.,Just did my first nature meditation. \\nAWESOME,Amazing absolutely astonishing,Headspace is a great supplemental tool to use if you’re looking for emotional and physical well-being whether you’re having a typical bad day, you’re having trouble sleeping, or you’re having a major life crisis. Of course it’s not a cure-all, but I’d definitely say it’s a help-all. It’s helped me in managing anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, grief, loneliness, being over-excited for events, ect. It’s even been of one the tools I use to calm my mind and help prevent migraines if I feel a small one coming on. \\n\\nPersonal experiences:\\n\\nOne night, back when I was pregnant, I was panicking from the grief of my mother dying of brain cancer, and that night I felt I could barely walk because of the overwhelming emotions I was having, but prayer and headspace helped me calm myself enough to function again that night. \\n\\nWhen I moved to a city after living my whole life in rural areas, headspace and prayer were what helped me overcome the feelings of being trapped and anxious. I started out with the free trial which was great. Then I was gifted the premium and I enjoyed that, though I wish it was always free ;). I’m back to the basics now, and it is still helpful.\\n\\nOverall, headspace has helped me calm down on a regular basis to levels I didn’t think were possible for me. Headspace along with counseling have led the way for me to overcome negative thought patterns I’ve had my whole life. \\n\\nHeadspace has taught me mindfulness meditation and helped me accept myself and appreciate my present reality. These techniques has showed me how to be as calm and clear headed as God intended when he created our bodies and minds to have those calming mechanisms such as deep breathing and visualizations already built in. Headspace can just help you discover those. \\n\\nHeadspace changed the way I help myself and my children cope with strong emotions. It’s helped me be more present and grounded in my own life, and that’s huge for me. Thanks, headspace.,Great mood changer,Headspace is a great tool, it’s calming and centering,❤️ 💕 my headspace to begin my joyful day!!!!!!!!!!!!,Life,i got this app because i wanted to meditate but there are only a few that are free. and the free ones are only 2-4 minutes long,I wish there was more teachers to meditate with that Andy.

This feels like a perversion of the practice. Canceling and going elsewhere.,The o,The app won’t open.,Terrific app,Amazing app!,It is soo good lol I love it,I should have reviewed this app years ago. 5 stars for sure. I’ve recommended it to so many friends and have given it as a gift many times as well.   \\n\\nI took a hiatus much of this last crazy year (ironically when I prob needed it the most) and when I recently came back, I see the total redesign with a ton of new content. So now we are scrolling through all this content, tons of media, noise, and suggested to set a myriad of notifications?!  Is this conducive to a quiet mind? No. In fact, every time I open the app I end up feeling super anxious.  I thought it was a one off, but it’s happened each time. It’s too much noise and it’s too chaotic at the time in the morning when I’m trying to start my day off right by focusing on presence, quieting the mind, and setting my intentions before leaping into my crazy day.  Now, instead of being a respite, a place for grounding, this app mirrors much of what life looks like these days and all social media apps.  Honestly, this really feels like Headspace “sold out.”\\n\\nOnce you dig around and find what you’re looking for, Andy’s soothing guided meditations are still there, and I do love the ambient noise and low-fi tracks that have been added. I get it. You’re trying to corner the market on all things zen. Gotcha. There’s a BD team making very different decisions than our beloved yogis and zen masters. So....\\n\\nIn the spirit of both staying true to the mission AND in consumer satisfaction (which is of course, good business) I will offer the perfect solution, instead of canceling my membership (yet) bc Andy is the best. Create a customizable home page. Let me drag over only the things I want on my page.  It would be what I see when I open the app and no need to navigate elsewhere if I don’t want to.  I would personally choose to keep it uncluttered and super simple with my mediations and maybe some music. Others may do something diff. To each their own.   And when I’m not in mediation mode, maybe then I’ll choose to dig around the other media and content to check out your new stuff, and drag and drop new favorites to my page.  But opening this app and seeing this chaotic stream of content is not sustainable for me, and I cannot imagine that I am alone in that.,Phenomenal app!! Andy is awesome!!,a lot of things are unlocked.,Love it,Love this !,the free trial and subscription cancelation does not seem to work.,1 star for nagging me to rate.,They were so mean,A lotus in an age of mud.,Headspace is incredibe,Hate the demoralizing run streak.,Noice app 🦦,Love it free!!!,I❤️Headspace i❤️meditating. cool 😎!,Yes,self explanatory,G o o d,🙏🙏🙏🙏,WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS IT MAKES NO SENSE JUST MAKE IT FREE CMON!!! Why isn’t FREE!!!!!!,deez feedee,Cool,Me encanto,Me encontraba realmente mal, estaba muy agobiado, cuando recibí un anuncio de la app de un ejercicio de respiración me hizo sentir mucho mejor, y ahora mismo acabo de hacer otra meditación y me siento mejor, de verdad apareció cuando más lo necesité, muchas gracias,Sehr gut und praktisch,Just beautiful,Best app for anger management ever because I have  very bad anger issues.,I am feeling better already!,عظيم حقا,Es increíble que deba de nuevo pagar por la aplicación que tampoco es tan económica.,C’est le meuilleur,Maravilloso lo estoy haciendo con mi hijo de 7 años y es fabuloso,Son increíbles es como si entraran a tu mente y la calmaran los amo mucho amigos,Hola, estoy haciendo estas meditaciones diarias poe\\nNetflix y son extraordinarias , me suscribí a las meditaciones por la Apple y no es de fácil acceso , y me siguen apareciendo los candados indicándome que debo suscribirme 😞😞😞,Me gusto el primer ejercicio porque a diferencia de otros deja libre el ritmo de respiración y la mente sin esfuerzos sin posturas y sin ordenar a disipar los pensamientos, sentí que era un método amoroso al ritmo de tu cuerpo. Gracias lo continuaré,Sinceramente, no sé cómo vivía antes sin esta aplicación.,App needs better navigation,Thank you Andy for introducing me to sleep meditation. I’ve never meditated before but this Covid crisis has changed many of our lives. Being introduced to headspace has changed my life and I’m so grateful for your voice, your influence and your ability to let me calm down and go to sleep.As a healthcare provider with many new stresses your entire team and many topics has gotten me through the past 18 months.Thank you Andy\\nMARIAN,mediation has helped me with ptsd and adhd. it’s not a cure but it helps me refocus and not be so in my head. it’s perfect for me.,At night I stay up until 11:00. I look up a YouTube video of how to fall asleep fast. I see an add for headspace. I downloaded it and it didn’t have anything for me to fall asleep fast. At least I didn’t see that. It also only put in text. I mean it didn’t say out loud what was on the screen. Raven when it did explain, I heard an  up soothing voice. Sorry about that one, but if you want to sleep fast this isn’t the app for you.,I have been using Headspace for approximately six years. I really like the basics you can start off with as well as the various topics. They have grown a lot, to compete with other apps I’m sure. I repeat series as well; there is always room for growth. \\nI have briefly used other meditation apps but this is still my favorite. I sort of feel like Andi is my personal meditation buddy.Me and my mom talk about him like we know him: “Today Andi said...” \\nI’m also interested to look into some of the other people that are featured—e.g., Kevin Hart & John Legend—I just have not done a lot of that yet,12.99 a month or 70.00 up front for a year? \\n\\nThis app has been a bright light in a dark time for me. But as all things do, it has come to an end due to the recent subscription update that restricts data unless you cough up money. \\nPretty sad.,Better price if you buy through headspace.com but they require an email to cancel auto renew. I thought this business practice had died out. Very uncool especially for a meditation app. Definitely damaged my calm,This app is so good download it now I’ve been so relaxed all my days because of.sooooo gOooooood,Headspace is great. I’ve been using it since 2019 and it essentially introduced me to meditation and mindfulness practices which I am eternally grateful for. However, the one complaint I have is the dark theme. I use the dark theme on my phone, but with headspace I prefer the light theme and I wish there was a way to set the dark/light theme within the app itself because I find myself constantly switching to the light theme specifically for this app and then back when I’m done using it. Thank you for this app and I hope you see this review and make dark/light theme setting within the app itself similar to the way YouTube has theirs.,I don’t meditate but this was recommended to me for sleeping. It unhelpful. The wind downs have these really annoying breathing exercises that are the opposite of relaxing and even more annoying to listen to the counting. It sounded more like a fitness class countdown. Countdowns from 1000? Even more annoying. The voices aren’t that soothing. Eve is okay and I typically enjoy foreign accents but there are exceptions for me (cockney, Aussie). No offense but usually you find at least multiple voices that are soothing. I did enjoy the Cat Marina sleep story but that was about it. I’d rather listen to V on Snoozecast or the hypnotic voice of Tracks to Relax. The soundscapes are also not very good. The sleep music is even worse. It’s jarring and they all seem to have the same tones. I’ve given this 3 weeks and it’s actually making my sleep worse so hoping this 30 day money back guarantee is legit because I’ve exercised it. I bought directly from Headspace so there ought not be any issue, but these other poor reviews have me concerned. I’ll update this review if it becomes problematic. The team behind this app should add me to a research panel. I’d really like to see them improve the sleep portion of this app.,For the last week, I have tried to click “explore headspace” and it refuses to work. I love the netflix show and the youtube channel and I thought the app would be great too, but it has continued to refuse to work.,Great app! Have tried Insight, Calm, and now Headspace.Somehow this app makes me eager to return each day, and I have been consistently coming back to enjoy the  calming effects !!,I saw this advertising on YouTube and I was playing some music to go to sleep when I decided to go and download the app. I ended up figuring out that almost everything was locked. Now I hate apps that are free and then ask for you to pay a large amount of money. And I get it you need money and if you want to pay for headspace plus that is fine. But a note to the makers. Have more things available for those who don’t want a subscription.,I am an immigrant with neurological condition. I signed up for a free a subscription using a code from a podcast to help me manage. They asked for my card numbers and I gave them.  I cant access my account . I reached out to their tech support and tell them about me and my problem with the app. They then closed my account. I cant get any answers - refusing to solve my problem. They are fake nice. \\n\\nUPDATE: 1 month - my account got charged! I did not allow them. I kept asking Aymane (IT tech) to help with ticket #ticket (2079180). . Did not listen - I kept being charged!! \\n\\nPlease stop!!\\nAymane | Headspace(Headspace),I first download headspace about 4-5 years ago because it was recommended to me by a therapist. Its was life changing, helped me tremendously with everyday anxiety. This app taught me to enjoy meditation, and I love the benefit! Every time I meditate I feel more grounded. They teach you how to meditate and have meditation course for just about anything. This app is seriously life changing. if you get anxiety a lot I 100000% recommend it, they have a wonderful course to help you be at peace with those feeling/thoughts.,If you dont feel like paying 12.99 a month please don’t get it. It cost money and people download this app because they are struggling and it should not cost money because people suffer from stress and anxiety that one thing that causes s*cide!! so like don’t buy it if you want free lessons and guidance for stress and anxiety,So my girlfriend and a friend told me to get this app as part of a student deal with Spotify to help with my mental health. It’s actually caused more frustration and anger trying to get it to work! It won’t let me access the student Spotify deal for no apparent reason and seems to have little option for quick support, I’ll be trying a different provider,The material on Headspace is pretty good. I’ve paid a year’s worth and can honestly say that I’ve not received the most use out of it. It’s mainly due to my anxiety that questions it’s usefulness and gets in the way of me using it regularly. Once I complete a session, I always feel better. I just have to do better with meditating. You could also receive similar types of led meditations on free platforms like Spotify and YouTube.,Headspace is such a great app, I mean I could use YouTube for meditation, sleep music and etc but headspace is more relaxing and reliable😁👌🏾👍🏾👌🏾. The only reason why I rated 4 stars is because I think we should be able to use everything on headspace free.😐,I don’t really like it be cause you have to start a free trial and stuff like who wanna play for this if you can just look it up on YouTube and yea hope this helps,Despite supposedly having free and paid branches, could bot find any free programming in the app. Was looking for sounds to sleep to. And I would not think it worth $12.99 monthly.,So I downloaded this application for my anxiety and as I listen to the meditation my phone shuts off after a minute or so and when the phone shuts off the meditation stops immediately which doesn’t make sense. So do I have to constantly watch my phone to make sure it’s on while doing meditation? Im in the free trial period, but if I’m going to subscribe to this and pay $69.99 a year then I should at least be able to close my eyes and be relaxed while listening without my phone shutting off and stopping the audio.,Headspace has helped me so much with my sleep. I hope when someone downloads headspace it helps them like how it helped me. I owe them a really big thank you. I don’t know who created the helpful app but thank you so much.Not only in sleep is it an,aging but shifting a diet to a healthier happier life.Even the yoga is great.I hope everybody who downloaded Headspace found it as amazing as I did!Thank to you my life is 10 times just more better!🌷🧘🏼\\u200d♀️🥰✌️,In all honesty, this app seems like a cash grab. The fact that you can’t even do the basics without paying for it is sad. You can tell that the creators didn’t create this to really help people. They just wanted money which is why basically everything is locked unless you pay for it. I would recommend searching up meditation videos on YouTube, it’s a lot of better meditations on YouTube.,It’s so relaxing 😍💕 I definitely recommend,blessed for this app,I have tried the free features of this app in the past, I follow the Podcast on Spotify and I have no doubt that headspace is great, but the motivation to leave this poor review -temporarily I hope- comes from a different aspect of my experience.\\n\\nToday, just about 6 minutes ago, I finished a 3-minute session and after being seduced by the “start your free trial button” I decided to go for it and test the premium features for a while. What I didn’t know is that It was going to charge me immediately for a “free trial”?\\n\\nI love the app, I appreciate Andy’s vision and the hardworking team behind every aspect of this ecosystem, but I am disappointed that I was charge a whole “anual subscription” and being honest, I am more stressed than before I even started the free 3-minute session.\\n\\nI see no button to contact support. I find no space where I could solve this situation and It would mean a lot to me If I could be refunded. \\n\\nI was planning on writing a different review after trying the premium features and few minutes after, a sudden twist and here we are. How could I enjoy my free trial when I didn’t get what the “CTA button” didn’t delivered what it promised?\\n\\nI hope somebody can contact me and help me. I would in return update this review to reflect what I originally expected to try after a couple of days.,This app helped me through a hard part in my life when no one else could.So I just wanted to say thank you!This is the only this that would actually help me with my anxiety and depression.l definitely recommend!😊,I paid for ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION $69.99 i paid!!!\\nBuy I new iPhone re-downloaded Headspace signed in with the same iCloud account he’s telling me\\n“Bad request No valid subscription found in receipt”?????????😡😡😡,You barely get any options because you have to pay for most of it.But other than that it’s been very helpful and good.,I have great difficulty turning off my mind for sleep. With the sleep cast I barely make it through an episode without drifting into high quality sleep.if I do wake up I turn it on again and drift right off. My favorites are the Cat Marina, The Midnight Launderette, and the Hummingbirds. I also watch wake up and working on meditation. Today I will explore movement.,I love Headspace, and in the past year they have increased their offerings tenfold: the WakeUp, high quality short videos about people and nature. The offerings on meditation have also increased as well as sounds for sleep that I have used many times. My only beef with Headspace is they had me on auto renew for $99 a month. I did not know that until the charge came through on my Amex. What made it worse is while on YouTube unrelatedly I saw a new customer discount with all the bells and whistles for about half what I paid. I took a picture, contacted them and never got a straight answer. I know it’s common practice for SaaS products to offer discounts to new customers, but they should honor the price if an existing customer sees it. So I have kept the subscription but I am ripe for new options. Loyalty is a two-way street.,The mediations are amazing I absolutely love it. I would like to give it five stars but just about everything is locked unless you pay $12.99 per month or $69.99 annually. Would still recommend to give it a try!,Reviewing this after being on the android version. The Apple version of this application is a lot better than the android version. It just works better. I now have a designated time to meditate. It’s been a lot of help during this COVID crisis.,Subscriptions like this can now be shared within a family if the developer switches on the option.\\n\\nThis would enable a family of 2-5 to pay one $69.99 yearly fee instead of each person paying full price (which is ridiculous!)\\n\\nIt’s simple to do (flick of a switch coding-wise) and better for users, but thus far they are choosing not to enable this feature.,There are some issues, first of all, if i want to sleep to a relaxing sound, i have to pay for it, pay pay pay! I dont want to pay for something just to calm down my anxiety at night, you atleast have to make most of your items free because i only saw 2-3 things free! Anyways if you want to fall asleep download Spotify! Thanks,I’m definitely not going to be renewing the $69.99/year subscription unless they improve the sleep meditations selections. There needs to be more and they need to be longer!,Well I love it personally but I don’t really wanna pay a lot of money just to help me relax. I could use YouTube but too many ads. I think maybe get rid of the subscription, give people their money back, and let people use headspace for free! Please consider it.\\n\\n𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑦, 𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑎-𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑎 𝐴,BIIGG SCAMMMMM I DOMT WANNA PAY THIS IS BIG SCAMMMMM DONT GET THIS AP ITS A SCAMM🙄🙄🙄😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😫👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻NOOOO BIG SCAM WHY GET THIS YOU HAVE TO PAYYYY YOU CAN LITERALLY GO ON YOUTUBE AND LISTEN TO CALIMG STUFF 👁👄👁💖💖💖💫🙌✨✨✨✨✨⭐️🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄NO HAVE TO PAY 💰 NoOOoOoO 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻🤡❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌💰💰💰💰💰💰❌❌❌,I started using Headspace in 2014, which was a great entry point into meditation for a total beginner. \\n\\nI stopped using it in 2017 for financial reasons but came back to it because I think it beats out the other free meditation apps due to the consistent quality of the meditations and the guided courses (without courses I ended up barely meditating anymore).\\n\\nMy only qualm is the new app interface/experience. I don’t know when it changed but it’s a lot more content-heavy and kind of confusing to navigate. I liked the simplicity of the old app (2014-2017 version I suppose). It also just feels like a different vibe a bit with all the social justicia content throughout, not really what I’d associate a meditation app with.\\n\\nAll in all, still a great app but hope it doesn’t get too detached from what it started as, a simple meditation app.,Recently switched to iPhone and this app had this cool feature the android one didn’t. The daily check list. It was so cool! But then a week later it’s gone ha. Bring it back please?,I have been using the headspace app for several years now. When I started I had no idea what meditation was about.Headspace has guided me from the basics to the more advance techniques of meditation which has given me a new perspective on life. Through meditation and the guidance of Andy ( I feel like we are on a first name basis after all these years) I have learned to be more mindful everyday. This affected my life by being more compassionate, relaxed and living in the moment. My relationship with my family, people who I don’t know in addition to myself to be significantly improved.\\nSteven M. Stoller,M.D.,FAAOS,This is by far the best app I’ve ever purchased.Do yourself a favor and try it out. It will make a difference in your life.,Firstly I don’t like that you make us pay for stuff when before it used to be free.another reason it is ok is there is no live meditation anymore...🤷🏼\\u200d♀️🤷\\u200d♂️,This app is amazing don’t get me wrong ! I’ve tried the wake up (for free) and LOVED it. I have also tried their meditation on YouTube, and of course their new show on Netflix. They calm you down, and really release that stress. I just don’t think I’m going to pay for it when I have back up for free (headspace YouTube and Netflix),All issues are not one size fits all so when the meditation managing anxiety and mindful eating are exactly the same, I get frustrated. The only difference in the 2 was the label. Also, I am do disappointed that you can’t run calming music in the background of the meditations. I live in a noisy space and need noise canceling headphones to meditate. Guess I’m going back to the FREE guided meditations on YouTube.,I am a Solfball player and I have to pitch 4 times a week and also Handle school.I get very stressed out and I don’t know what to do about it.I seen a add about a app called HeadSpace and I thought this may help me with relaxing and clearing my stress.And it did!I have used this app for a day and I love it!And Dora is my favorite teacher!Thank you for making this app! 110% recommend this app if you have a busy schedule each week like me or just been very stressed lately.(They can even help you sleep!)🖤🦋🌷,I was watching YouTube on my iPad,  (As Usual) and it was almost time for bed. Then, an add came up for headspace. I looked at the reviews and then I decided to give it a try. My favorite noises include: The Ocean, Forests, And The Rain. I turned on the ocean, and I closed my eyes. The next thing I know, It was morning! I was very surprised, because I had never fell asleep this fast! I recommend this app to you. Goodbye! 💚,I love love this app but I am charged $12.99 per month and there are still locked meditations and places that say “Start your free trial” and “upgrade to plus”. I thought that’s what I was paying for? I’m logged in, and my credit card is on file so is it a larger monthly payment for Plus? What have I been paying for? The billing is the only thing I would change.,Omg here’s a little story ok so today 1-23-21 12:36am I love to stay up lol anyaways I was looking for a meditation app so I can get all my stress and anxiety out of my body so I downloaded head space because I looked at the reviews and I was all 5 stars and I was like ok imma download it so I did and I loved it and as I keep on using it it changed my life so now when I’m stressed I go straight to headspace ☺️🗣👂🏽👁👍,Headspace is a great app but it’s just so extremely expensive. $12.99 a month? That’s as much as Netflix, which has a ton more content and Netflix’s content costs millions of dollars to produce. I know the same isn’t true for Headspace\\n\\nIf you pay a year in full the price goes down to $5.99 a month. It’s more reasonable but I don’t want to pay a year in full. Even then, it’s pricy\\n\\nI think I would pay $4 a month for headspace. That seems like a fair price to me. We’re not all rich,I entered a support ticket on Jan 10 regarding an issue with the main page not loading correctly. This started during my 2 week trial period and I really wanted to like this app. It’s not very chill experience to open an app to a giant red error message in your face first thing, and I think about it during my meditation practice. 🤦\\u200d♀️  Support swapped my support specialist a few days after I submitted and they almost cancelled my ticket altogether and then after catching them up on the issue (again) they later said my issue MIGHT be related to a known issue and that there is nothing they could do but to look out for an update. Still waiting on this update. So frustrating, definitely testing my mindfulness 😂 (Ticket number 1957954),It’s great !!!! I Fell asleep so well ! And it was a great start to my morning . Using this app. But so many things u can’t use if you aren’t apart of the premium part . Which I’m not because i don’t want to pay . But overall it’s awesome ! Definitely recommend!,Thank you to all who worked to make the app a possibility. I recommend this to anyone at any age to be quite honest. There are so many options depending on what your need is. Whether you want to work on mastering stress, or dealing with anxiety to wanting to be more positive. It all ties together. I was in a very dark place, but thanks to Andy and his team I’ve been able to steer in the right direction over and over again. I’ve been a faithful customer for years now. $12.99 a month is better than $20-$30 bucks a month on coffee. 😅,If you see this review please read. Headspace helped me through a horrible period in my life of depression and some suicidal thought. the anxiety courses as well help since i suffer from bad anxiety too. please download this app if you haven’t and yes it costs money but i got it for free through my job. even if you don’t get it for free, trust me it will be the best money you’ve ever spent. thank you for your time:),I love The Wake Up!  And I’m enjoying completing courses and watching the BBC videos as well.  Headspace is a real treasure trove of resources to help anyone learn to meditate and maintain the healthy habit.,Update 8/23/17 - many hours in and still enjoying the app. New design is much better too. I\\'ve been taking a \"technique\" based approach through the packs and currently find noting to be the most applicable to daily life. \\n\\nI\\'ve enjoyed all the journeys on the app thus far. The queues and directions are great. The assignments for the day help to take the practice into the rest of the day. Thanks!,Relaxing,Cannot recommend this enough! My only complaint is the price but after using it for a year I’ll still continue to pay for it!,It just takes time and dedication. Don’t worry if you feel like you’re not doing it well. Just be consistent and dedicate time. It will help your mental health.,Meditation came into my life during a trying time, and while I struggle with being consistent about my practice. I do find a lot of benefit from it and hope that everyone gives it a chance to find that clarity and peace we are all looking for in life.,I need help to walk me through the process. The voice is kind and soothing but not enough to put you to sleep. Just enough to walk you through and help you succeed in your meditation. Love this app.,It was a nice app, it tracked your minutes and tracked your daily meditation times, but if your looking for a free meditation app this isn\\'t for you. Pretty much is locked and you need to unlock everything by buying this monthly thing. So overall it was pretty meh.,I feel so good after just a few minutes in my first session,The app is user friendly and the instructors are very nice.,This is a great app that needs to be updated. I open the app on my series 4 Apple Watch and it always tells me phone not reachable and never says anything else, even while the phone is in my hands searching for the heart rate. So it becomes a bit frustrating with each use but the breathing section works very well to easily change the times for inhaling and exhaling. I would give five stars when the app actually works with my watch.,The proven science is that slowing your breathing relaxes you.  That’s all that’s needed to calm yourself.  Inhale and exhale when the app says to, and you will get a very nice meditative feeling.   Be sure to set the number of seconds for the inhale and the exhale; these will vary from person to person.,This app was highly recommended by a doctor. Overall not terrible but I can’t connect from my Apple Watch nor will any of the videos connect. Hoping an update soon corrects these issues.,This app has changed my life. Learning to breathe from your diaphragm is a complete game changer. Make this app a habitAnd make a huge impact in your PTSD, anxiety, stress, depression, ADHD, EVERYTHING!,This app does not connect to the internet. It’s nice to read about the breathing y the video should be the main way to learn.,I am a 24 year old nurse with mental health issues and I have a couple of bad habits I’ve been trying to eradicate for months. I’ve tried dozens of apps from habit streaks to accountability apps to online counseling. I installed this app with the intent to explore it and nothing else. But this app is so cleverly designed, it is hard not to love. There are attractive features in this app that will help you build positive habits. Yet, I believe the real hook is the story about you that develops, which happens when you successfully complete your goals. This app does an excellent job of not just making you think, but making you do, which is what I think is the epitome of mental health. It doesn’t just strive to improve your mental health, it strives to improve your overall function. The app engages you in multiple ways, which sets it apart from the traditional templates of regular one-on-one convos with people who only roundabout with Pinterest-like “inspirational sayings.” I’m genuinely more motivated, more functional, and have made more changes in my life the past two weeks since I’ve downloaded this app than I have in the last three years. Fabulous mysteriously makes it fun to remind you to be yourself and be healthy and happy at the same time, and keeping those streaks up can be pretty satisfying too. However you use this app, whether it’s for a day or for a year - strive to commit to it, and you will reach your happiness.,I had previously come across this app in the past, downloaded it to see what the hype was and instantly deleted. Recently I came across this user who had recommended using fabulous to get back on track, and creating good, healthy habits. I’ve always been a routined person, but would fall off and struggle to keep track or stay on track. I would beat myself up and feel disappointed that I had to start over. After taking some needed time off for myself (especially during the pandemic) I am and have been working on myself to heal by getting back into creating healthy and happy routine for a better life. \\n\\nJust recently downloading this app (again) I wanted to put this to the test. Only after about a week of using this app, I will say that this app is by far one of the best apps I’ve ever used. It’s so gentle but so rewarding and honest about life and being “O.K.” With falling off track, making mistakes, counting the small wins, feeing appreciative, but the biggest one is making me believe in myself more by becoming the best version of myself. Mental health is so important and this app makes you feel like the darks do happen, but you can always come out on top. \\n\\nSo if I had to say what is an app that works and I’m willing to spend the money...well, you’ve come to the right place.,I actually got this app a couple months ago when I needed so positive affirmations or medications to just kind of get through the day... as I started slinking a little further into a pretty dark depression I didn’t use it I actually deleted it for a bit and frustrated that I couldn’t get into to app. I thought this little story’s were annoying... then a few weeks back I had gotten so bad I wasn’t eating or taking care of my self at all I started searching for routine apps to just try and get myself taking care of myself to feel better... As I was searching I saw this app pop up and I remembered it did have routines as well. I re downloaded it and I can actually say for the last few weeks of using it. I’m starting to like the story’s and the guidance because I WAS READY... had I reviewed this app a couple months ago it wouldn’t have been positive because that’s not where I was... but I can now say thank you! Because this app is really helping me build better habits and stay on task and I check back on it often and now listen to the story’s because I know it’s going to get me to that next level of taking care of myself. As a Mom/Wife/ and in Management... Who has time for that? Right. Thanks again for a program that’s actually working for me.,If this app was working right, it would be a five star app. But it is not and has not been for about two weeks. It’s been glitching, not allowing me to access today’s list of goals and routines to check off. My daily coaching option that’s on my routines no longer brings anything up to play for the day and instead just has a list of activities you could bring up. I bought the lifetime subscription and I’m kicking myself for it now that nothing is working on it. I’ve been using this app on and off for five years among varying devices without glitching issues and now all the sudden now that I’m on day 34 or so on my current journey, it’s just decided it no longer needs to work. \\nAnother annoying thing is that if you forget to mark the things off as you’re doing them and decide to mark it off later, it doesn’t seem to count it the same as though you didn’t actually do anything but are just checking it off. I find this incredibly annoying. Not everyone has time to stare at their phone after every activity on their list and check it off. I’m a busy person. Some of us want to check it off later, that doesn’t mean we didn’t do it when we are supposed to. Good lord.\\nAlso, I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall this app several times just to get it to work. I shouldn’t have to do that. There’s plenty of space on my phone and everything else works fine. Why is this app so glitchy?!,Tried this app last year and didn’t find it all that motivating. No worries…everyone has their preferences. Forgot to cancel before my free 30 day trial was up. No worries…that’s on me. But I made sure to go in and cancel right away so I wouldn’t make the same mistake again. Imagine my surprise when I started getting ‘payment failed’ emails after the one year anniversary of the expiration of my free trial. Like, enough emails to be considered harassment. So finally, I responded to one of them and reminded them that they did not have an active credit card on file because I was no longer an active account holder. I received an automatic response saying how much they value me as a customer and they’ll try to get back to me as soon as they can, but they’re super busy. No worries - they can never get back to me as far as I’m concerned - the whole point of my email was that I was trying to get them to STOP contacting me. SOOO…imagine my surprise when I checked my credit card statement today and found that a week after my email that they were too busy to respond to, they MIRACULOUSLY found my credit card information and charged my account for another year!!! NOT fabulous. SNEAKY and UNETHICAL!! Oh, and if you’re wondering if they ever responded to my email…they did not. Too busy looking for my unauthorized credit card information, I imagine. So, unless you want a lifelong relationship with this company, I cannot advise signing up.,So the path of slow and steady incremental changes makes a ton of sense. The kinds of tasks it seems like the app orients on, also seem well founded and useful. However, the way you interact with the app itself to achieve those ends is so confusing and unintuitive to me. There’s no one place to look at what I’ve achieved or how I’m doing, or which goals I might choose. Even after using it for a few days, I’m still unsure of where to find any succinct information or even which buttons I should be pressing. In addition, the way it offers me the option to make goals and follow up with those goals just doesn’t match the natural way I make decisions or the flow of my day. \\nFor example, I’d see the notification to drink water with bleary eyes immediately after waking up, but before my brain can comprehend. Then it disappears into the fog of slowly waking. This morning, I finally did get myself to immediately open the app and log that I drank water, then it promptly opened a loud animated cut scene which was pretty annoying for me, but even more annoying for the person asleep next to me. I hastily closed the whole thing. \\nI’d really like to utilize the set of slow and consistent reminders that seem to be at the heart of this app, but what does it matter if I can’t actually figure out how to use it? Frankly, every time I open this app I eventually just angrily close it, and am left feeling frustrated. I’d never pay for it.,After going through a very dark period, and as someone who has struggled with depression my entire life, I can honestly say Fabulous helped bring me back to life, back to myself. I have spent decades learning self care and reparenting myself, but in the very dark times, it can still be challenging to come out the other end. In this particular instance, I truly needed my hand held and guidance back to my light. Fabulous gave me this gift and so much more. When in a state of depression, something as simple as remembering to drink water or eat a good breakfast or move my body can feel like a mountain to climb. Fabulous’ gentle daily reminders, along with lovely inspiring encouragement, made all of these small goals attainable again. If you’ve struggled with depression, you know the impact such small feats can have. I have been using the app for over a month now and after completing the first journey am feeling so much more energized and vibrant - I feel like my true self again. It has truly laid the foundation for me to continue living my life healthily and happily. In a word, Fabulous has become my greatest companion or ally. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.,I have recommended this app to multiple people as it has been a great way for me to track my progress and receive consistent accountability. I love how customizable the routines are, and while there is guidance from the app, you’re ultimately in control of your experience. As far as feedback goes, I’ve grown to strongly dislike the background music. I understand the healing and relaxation properties that music can have, but I find these specific tunes very annoying compared to meditative sounds I prefer. I have muted the sounds during the routines and also went to settings to turn them off. Unfortunately it comes back on no matter what I do. I also believe that celebrating overall progress would be nice. In addition to longest streaks, acknowledging consistent attempts will encourage people even more I believe. For instance, I have never completed an entire week of my routines, but there was one week I tried everyday, and there were only two days I couldn’t fully complete. I like to celebrate small wins, and that to me was one. Other than that I love what the Fabulous team is doing with the app. All I ask is that you either offer different selections of background music and/or allow a muting option that actually works please.,I stumbled across this app and thought I’d give it a shot. One of the things I suffer from is lack of accountability, I’ll procrastinate and avoid things of I can, choosing to lay around and be lazy if no one is telling me otherwise. This app reminds me throughout the day to practice new healthy habits that I chose to create a happier and more active me! The support from the positive community here and the inspiring little messages that come with goal completion give you that extra push to continue on the path you set up. I’ve only been doing it for a week and albeit a slow start, I am beginning to really see some new habits form and I love it! Be the healthier, happier you that you know you can and want to be. It’s as simple as saying “I want to change” and you don’t have to do it alone. Having served 10 years in the military I recognize the importance of support in trying to develop yourself into your goals. Except instead of a DI yelling in your face to push through, you have a supportive community that provides the same support, but in a calm and motivating manner. Different tactics, similar results! So happy I found this app!,I have a lot of personal goals that just seemed impossible, this app was great for me a person with add who rd DS to push up hill than and force things rather than stop and do the things that lead to self care and happiness. For me it’s recipe to self love. Make sure you read at least one page, meditate for a few minutes. I like the animations and the calming music that helps me to slow down and be in the moment. But sometimes I fall off the wagon and though the intentions are good, im forced to fill out a form that takes too long and ultimately discourages me from getting back into my routine. Sometimes the Home Screen is so cluttered with junk I’ll never read. I\\nOr I ignore. Perhaps the ui hasn’t quite been mastered to make me care of the flow needs adjusted? I need a way out sometimes.  I also suggested to my partner to give it a shot, I really sold it to him because he’s doing self care work. The initial onboarding sent him into an eye roll and I’m certain he will never open it again. Which is sad because I feel like he could e joy it. I’m a designer and I get wanting to be the be all comprehensive app. But it feels like it’s gotten a little unwieldy. You need to give people some space and not force them to do it your way.,This app totally works — building habits a little at a time is precisely what my last therapist told me works very well for my ADD and anxiety. Doing one thing for a few days, then adding another little thing, and so on, had been working great for me for a little over a week now. \\nI’ve seen people say that the app is inflexible in its goals, but most of the time you can work around the specifics and do something else in the same vein. I can’t drink a full glass of water first in the morning because of my acid reflux, but I can remember that it’s a goal of mine and drink 4-5 extra sips. I don’t exercise first thing in the morning, but instead I did 8 mins of yoga. \\nThis is great therapy for those of us who can’t get access to behavioral therapy right now. I feel more refreshed when I go about my business in the morning because I have more habits to keep me moving. I feel rewarded just for drinking water. In principle, this app is amazing. \\nThe only issue is that there are so many buttons and screens that it gets wildly confusing sometimes as to what I’m trying to do and how I got here. I end up just force closing sometimes and starting over.,This app is absolutely amazing. It may have a confusing set up at first but it really helps you once you’ve figured out how it works. There’s routines for throughout the day which help you get up and start moving and have a plan for your day. This app also has “circles” designated to certain things that you may be struggling with. It allows you to chat with others from all around the world and share your experiences and help each other. I think this feature is really great because you get to see others progress in their life and you also get to help them with it, and share your progress. There are also journeys that you set up to help you with everyday problems. For example, social media detox, self-love, de-clutter, gratitude, being able to let go, journaling, etc. This app gives you a chance to reflect and change yourself for the better. It’s really inspiring all the positivity this app and the people using it radiates. Overall, this app is phenomenal and I would definitely recommend it if you struggle with being productive, self-love, etc.,I really like the visuals like seeing the calendar at a month glance and seeing the progress that I’ve made. But it’s not a convenient thing at this point if I add one thing to my morning routine that I’ve already been doing so well at and I miss one thing I don’t get my mark on top of that I can’t go back further and make sure it’s properly tracking. So I have been on track my calendar doesn’t show it and that makes me sad and I also know that I need to cancel my membership for this application going forward it’s two limiting and it’s not helpful when I feel defeated.\\n\\nI enjoy the app I love the instant positive feedback. I appreciate the pace and reading about why were setting up the structure for personal success. However I am bummed that you can’t go back and rewatch the animated journey and there doesn’t seem to be away two go back and edit your meals or habits from the night previous. When I turn my phone off for the night I’m not gonna pick it back up to click that I did a meditation so I would like to be able to toggle between days and to rewatch cartoon journey , One for encouragement and two I was excited to share with others what a great app but there was not a way for me to do so.,I tried to set up this app for the free trial (7 days) but it made me start with only one habit that happened to already be something I do every day. And then because I don’t always look at my phone every morning and didn’t check off a day even when I did it, it set me back to day 1. So the one week trial was useless to see if I could build new habits. When I cancelled before getting charged, they sent me an email offering me a 30 day trial since 7 days might not be enough—this seemed like a great option until I tried to use it and because I already had an account it said “you’ve already subscribed”. So they sent me a useless 30 day trial unless I want to create a second account and start over from day 1, again. \\n\\nBesides those issues, i found the animations to be rather annoying and pointless. Maybe it works better over the long term, but it really feels oriented towards teens and young adults and I wouldn’t recommend it. The interface is also not intuitive and you have to go through like 5 steps to check off each habit, which feels like it wastes a bunch of my time when I could be actually getting on with my day. I will be searching for a streamlined alternative.,I signed up for a free trial looking for an app to help me develop, maintain and track healthy habits. I used it for a couple days but ultimately, it was just too difficult to navigate and had a lot going on. I am a millennial so I’m fairly competent with technology but I was truly just lost in this app so I quit using it and forgot about it. It was renewed without any reminders of notifications for the annual fee. I immediately cancelled it and attempted to contact customer service through the app to request a refund. I was shortly notified via email that I had to request a refund through a link they sent me. There were many options and I picked the one that said I forgot to cancel my free trial and I was notified that because Apple tells me when the free trial will end and the subscription will renew when signing up for the free trial, they do not refund for that. It was truly an honest mistake. Anyways, just to check, I attempted to see if a refund was able to be received for any of the reasons listed and they do not reimburse for their subscriptions no matter the case. I was just taken aback because that type of monetary greed just didn’t seem to vibe with what they attempt to promote in the app.,How do you unsubscribe from the free trial? I worry about getting charged additional fees that I have not consented to. Without thinking to read the reviews, I downloaded the app and I didn’t know you had to make a $40 payment after the trial ends. I do not have the money nor could afford it. I deleted the app before the free trial had ended but my email is linked. I didn’t create a premium account though which I am really confused about. (Note: I’m unsure if I’ve actually been charged because I deleted the app) This app has vague instructions and poorly explains how to delete an account and unsubscribe. I’ve emailed the developers but I keep receiving automated responses. I attempted to fill out the form they provide but I doubt my luck in getting the answer I need. I feel uncomfortable that this app still has my email address and any other personal information I have provided. The developers is definitely scamming people of their money and stands opposite of their beliefs. Terrible support system. Don’t make the same mistake as I did by downloading this app thinking it would be life changing. It’s just a money grubbing nightmare. You’ll regret it + It’s not worth your time.,I can’t say enough about Fabulous Premium. As someone diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, the app has been more helpful to me than anything I have tried so far, and it’s worth every penny! Fabulous helps by reminding you to take care of yourself before anything else. I’m learning that my mental and physical well-being is the foundation for success. There is never a shortage of support while progressing through routines and challenges. The challenges are simple—typically things you do every day—but the encouragement you get for completing tasks makes it seem like drinking water or brushing your teeth is a big deal. And it is! So often, I think we forget that even the smallest accomplishments are still putting us on track for a healthier, happier tomorrow. Thank you so much to all the founders, creators, developers, employees, and everyone else in between for making this app what it is—a lifesaver!,Love the app so far it’s a wonderful concept and has completely changed the way I look at my routine! I purchased the premium subscription, but would actually not recommend until some bugs were resolved and user experience issues. The timer for your schedule experiences does not continue outside of the app making it pretty useless in certain settings. But my REAL pet peave is how little journeys are customized and how specific they are about asking you to do things without knowing your diet/sleep schedule etc. For example, I intermittent fast, so when it tells me that for a journey I HAVE to eat breakfast three days in a row, can’t do that. A journey to “eat fish and seafood or flax seeds three times in a week” allergic to fish, can’t do that”, tells me to go to sleep and follow their schedule umm I work nights. there should 100% be an option to skip these journeys or convert them/ customize them/ change the time they’re to be accomplished, or something I don’t know but the user experience I do have in this area occasionally frustrates me.,I like the interface of this app for scheduling habits, however I hate the process of actually logging them. During the day, I just want to mark the job done and move on. Unless you complete the task onboarding flow, your changes aren’t saved and you have to mark things complete again. I do appreciate the task onboarding flow for night routines since I’m getting ready for bed and naturally have more time to spend on the app. \\n\\nThis app should also come w/ a trigger warning as it stands today. The community posts aren’t filtered and the suicide notes were jarring for my first time looking through the community. Not saying we should sweep them under the rug, but these posts naturally get a lot of traffic because basic human instinct is to offer help to someone at their lowest point. However, I’m guessing the traffic pushed notes like this to the top of the feed. This resulted in me reading through at least 3-5 posts about suicide on day 1 using this app. Hoping there’s a compromise that can take place to remedy this issue.,I’ve been using Fabulous for a little over a week and I love it. The daily coaching can be very insightful and so far I’ve been able to cement the following morning habits: drinking water as soon as I wake up, eating a good breakfast to fuel up for the day, and doing some low-impact exercise in the mornings to help me wake up fully and get moving. This may not sound like a lot but just two weeks ago I was setting four alarms every night and snoozing them repeatedly in the morning, rolling out of bed and into the shower and trudging to work without having ingested anything but coffee. I particularly love that Fabulous discourages you from trying to take on too much at once or make too many changes; instead, the focus is on building one habit at a time and celebrating small victories. This makes it SO MUCH easier to actually stick with your new habits, without feeling overwhelmed. Whoever made this app knew what they were doing, and I can’t thank them enough!,This is the BEST self care app in the entire App Store HANDS DOWN.  I usually try and use free versions of all the apps I use but this app is the only premium version subscription that I will pay for.  I was seriously shocked when I learned how much the monthly premium subscription was because it’s worth every dollar PLUS MORE. You definitely get a lot more out of your money than you’d be able to find anywhere. I love that this app continues to not only teach something new everyday, but also allows you to experience something new everyday. I love how it isn’t repetitive.  I feel like every single person needs to utilize this app for mental health, personal daily life coaching, physical health, healthy relationships, and daily self care. Whoever created this app is literally a genius. 🙌🏽 THANKYOU so much for the gift you’ve given in creating and sharing this app with all of us!  It for sure has changed my life for the better! ❤️,I’ve been looking for ways to create more accountability as I work toward creating better habits & routines (in my overall goal of living a life of intention & purpose), and the Fabulous app is THE best one I’ve found so far. I love how it guides me step by step, day by day, to “check off” habits as I complete them, even giving recommendations on new habits that I should start, based on my goals. The ambience within the app—the soothing & uplifting colors & music, even the voice of the “coach” in the mini-coaching sessions (2-3 mins)—is especially appealing to me, as I am a very visual person/learner. There are a few other features within the app that I’ve not yet fully explored; but overall, this app has helped me more in one week than any other accountability & encouragement avenues I’ve tried so far. I look forward to continuing my “Fabulous Journey” and highly recommend & encourage you to check it out to.,I am a 38 year old married working mom mother of   2 teen girls ages 17 senior and 11 6th grader who have been distance learning since April while both my husband and I were furloughed for several months but now work from home most of the time when we don’t randomly have to go in and then have to pray plan b or c for coverage at home when we both have to go in..so basically my stress levels are those of  an average person today.  😊 With all the “new normals”, habits went out the window for all in this house so I was determined to turn it around by starting with me. \\nThis app has changed so many aspects of my everyday to a positive state by simply helping me create the simple habit of drinking water daily. That’s it. The motivational tools used in the app work. I am usually skeptical and horrible at change. I am a create of habit but those habits were not the good kind until now. Now to get my tribe in line! Thank you Fabulous!,Living by myself has been difficult. I get bored and spend so much time on my phone. I can never think of anything else to do. I don’t know how to break up my day. I don’t drive so I’m very isolated, not just because of quarantine, but especially right now because of quarantine. Then I saw this app come up on Instagram and it was advertised with some Myers Briggs types of I remember correctly. Basically saying we could build a routine where my personality type would thrive and I love that. It’s really helped me find things to do and break up my day and stay motivated to do them by feeling accomplished when I check things off the list, even when it’s something simple like drinking water or eating breakfast. I feel so much better already and it’s only day 3. I love this app and I highly recommend it. I would love to subscribe but I prefer to pay month by month and that option doesn’t exist yet, as far as I know.,I’ve tried multiple schedule & routine building apps, including just using google calendar to set goals for myself, but I’ve never been as dedicated to my routines as I am thanks to Fabulous. Not only does the interface make things easy to use, but I love the little positive reminders and motivators. I actually feel excited about my routines because I have something to keep me focused now! I have ADHD and it’s easy for me to get off topic, but now I just start my fabulous app, put in my headphones, and work my way through each of my goals. I love that there is a feature to set a duration for each task too, it’s totally customizable! It makes it easy for me to let my timers run, even if I am off the app for a workout or meditation. Thank you, Fabulous team, for making an app that not only helps you with your goals but motivates you to complete them in such a self-love oriented way!,I was really looking forward to purchasing the premium yearly subscription. I tried the app about a year & half ago when I was at my worst in life but I didn’t have the energy and motivation to follow through. I decided to give it another try this year, especially with a fresh start of the year and I’m doing better in life thank God, but there’s areas of improvement for me, specifically strengthening habits.\\n\\nThe app has so many elements & moving parts to it, it gets too confusing & overwhelming. From the design, to the videos, to the notes, to suggestions. They are all over the place, I tend to miss certain pieces & am jumping throughout the app to make sure i don’t miss anything. \\n\\nI’m never sure if I indeed checked off drinking water for that particular day or if i should add a afternoon habit & when. Sometimes, a video pops up when i accomplish a goal, sometimes it doesn’t. I’m unable to save the post to share tips on my phone. Maybe I can but like I said, so many moving parts, not simplistic enough especially for those who want to build a habit & ease anxiety like myself.,This is much better designed (and beautiful!!). It’s really intended for people who need help with a “reset”, especially in my opinion for people struggling with self-care due to mental health. It really encourages you to just do one or two things at first and take it slow, versus automatically giving you access to absolutely everything (and therefore setting you up to fail). Plus it’s got these cute stories, poems that are sort of like super quick mediation, and REALLY good animation. Plus it’s got a huge number of tips, gentle reminders, and inspirational messages to go along with the habits. So when it started telling me to eat breakfast every day (which you are technically allowed to delete if you’re super against breakfast I guess), it also started adding a daily tiny article about food, or breakfast ideas, or (my favorite) reminders to actually buy breakfast foods... Really loving this so far!,A lot of moving parts/themes/ multi-part metaphors and features makes this feel slightly less cohesive and user friendly than I’d like. After all my problem is that I complicate my routines  and objectives and that’s why I sought an app to help me. But it IS very good at tracking habits and offering motivation as well as sound principles and reasons for each step. I’m a fan! \\n\\n I’ve at least been drinking water and usually eating breakfast as well as calming my self before bed—the three default habits the app starts you with. Aaaand I attached some other habits to the ones mentioned without actually logging them, just as part of completing the other steps like making my bed as I drink water in the morning and doing my skin care routine as part of my nightly coaching and wind down. It’s only been (almost) three weeks but this is the most consistent I’ve been with anything, so I’m excited to streamline more parts of my life!,Last weekend I deleted two social media apps on my phone that I was spending 3-6 hours engaging with daily. I replaced them with a set of apps & tools to train myself to engage with new habits that promote productivity, achievement, and a sense of well-being. This app is one of those four! In fact, this app is my primary driver throughout the day. My days now have a beginning, middle, end. I am engaged in ways that make guide me to being present, inspired, and motivated to keep going. After first, we started small - 3 days in a row of drinking water. Then I added afternoon and evening routines. The app sends a morning, afternoon, and evening coaching clip - SUPER GOOD. I was very pleased by the variety of options of new habits to form. I love the storytelling rpg style of progress, as well as the Focus Zen Mode that walks me through each step in my routine with prompting questions.,Pay for the premium.  If you follow the program, I *guarantee* you will change your life for the better.  After nearly a decade of being bedridden by disability, all my former structure & good habits were gone.  I’m doing better now & am trying to re-enter the world, so to speak. Fabulous is helping me rebuild not just my daily habits, but all aspects of my life.  I get far more value from this program than it costs.\\n\\nThe site is very deep, with many options so you build a journey that works for and with YOU, not some standardized hypothetical being that never walked the face of the earth.\\n\\nI don’t have time to give an in-depth review because I’m too busy being Fabulous — and your journey will be different than mine, anyhow.  But if you’re ready to commit to changing your life in any way, Fabulous will help you achieve your goals and feel fulfilled.\\n\\n(Though dear developer guys, bad verse is just bad verse.  The writer of the daily story segments isn’t good enough to pull it off.  Editors should have warned you that these forced rhymes actually detract from the comprehension process, not enhance them.  Also, you need a proofreader — each day I find typos, grammar errors, etc. — not tons, but always at least one.  I know that’s the new normal, but I don’t care.  Proofread your site.  Thanks.),I feel like I often get distracted when trying to form new habits or get discouraged when I lack the motivation to follow through on a new task I was so excited for (involving self care, a new craft project etc) and this app is such a nice gentle way to ease into practicing healthier habits, I love the “fabulous moments” and the slow stream of suggested habits. I feel like with other planning apps it leaves it all up to the user as to what you need to do and when and all those choices can seem overwhelming. I really appreciate the gentle introduction and slow adding of new habits which I’ve found has made them more lasting. The only reason I deducted a star is because the reminders don’t always  show up for me in terms of notifications or noises when I need them which can be a little frustrating and it is 60 dollars a year which is a lot for me and I’m sure some of you,I’ve only been using the app for a few days now, but the pace and routine forming capabilities are clear.  I find the tips and journey videos quite soothing and thoughtful.  I would have given a 4.5 star but can’t do halves.  I have two things I’d love to see, one, when it suggests I share my progress it’s showing me an image I thought would go with my share, but in reality the only thing that shares is a link for the app...not a big deal, but probably won’t share that way anymore.  The second thing I’d like to see, being able to get back to videos or recordings that were available on previous days.  Like today, I was doing my breathe routine and there wasn’t any pop up guidance on different breathing techniques like there was the previous 3 days; or sometimes I missed part of the journey video because the kids interrupted.  It’d be nice to be able to see these somehow.,If you ask me a life changing app will not need to shake you down for cash.  The impact will be so significant that the cost will be irrelevant.  I downloaded this app after it peaked my interest.  I tried it out a little but it did not relate super well with me.  I attempted to turn off the subscription after two days because I knew I had not yet fell in love with it.  \\n\\nLow and behold 10 days in, I was still somehow charged the recurring subscription fee.  I attempted to immediately ask the app customer service for a refund as I was not interested.  The app makers literally have no process for completing refunds for any situation, period.  Apple did give me a refund when I submitted a request.  \\n\\nStand by your product, and only make a sale when you know your customer is getting good value.  I don’t believe for a second, that you are interested in changing peoples lives.  It appears you think you have to sales pitch everyone hard and then steal their money when they are not interested in your app.  Disgusting, how do you sleep at night?,I tried this app one day, it was not what I wanted.  I deleted the app and went to cancel my subscription.  It WILL give you a free week, but it WILL NOT allow you to cancel the subscription during your free week!   Day 1: I tried it and deleted the app within 2 hours.  I could not delete the subscription!  Apparently they charge you immediately!  Day 2: I received a “paid subscription” receipt from Apple.  So, apparently their “free week “ is a week you don’t pay for, but you have already paid for your subscription!\\nI still have 5 days in the “free” week, and supposedly can cancel the subscription up to a day ahead of the subscription date.  Not only will it not allow me to delete the subscription, but they had the nerve to Bill me in day 2 of my “free” week.  FALSE ADVERTISING - they give you the impression you get a free week, and then decide if you want to subscribe. “Delete the subscription anytime up to a day ahead of the renewal.”  They don’t tell you the “renewal” date is as soon as you use the app.  TOTAL RIP-OFF.,This app is great for people who have trouble with motivation.  I have ADHD and this has helped me focus and stay motivated without overwhelming me.  It helps the whole dopamine deficiency issue that comes with the disorder by setting small goals that are easy to achieve so I can stay motivated.  I’ve started meditating and praying consistently as well as doing yoga.  I’ve done better remembering to take my pills.  I might suggest having an option where we can have different goals on different days, because I am in school right now, and while it’s great to have someone remind me to go to class, I can’t very well do that on a Sunday.  But overall, this app has seriously helped me keep a positive and health mindset, and I feel much better than I did before.  This is like antidepressants without the fear that I’m somehow messing up my body.  Amazing job!,This past year I’ve been getting into the habit of having a daily checklist. Doing it on paper was less effective because I would forgot most of the things on my list later in the day. This app does an amazing job at motivating and reminding me to stay on top of my goals! Ive only been using it for a little over a week, but Fabulous was exactly what I was looking for! I finally feel like I have all the resources to get serious about my routine. Thank you for the work this team has done to create such an amazing program. The $40 for the year is totally worth it considering how much extra classes and awesome manifestation techniques they provide. If you’re looking to connect with your mind, body, and spirit and finally gain balance and self discipline in life, this is the app for you! 10/10 would recommend!!!,Love the content. Self-care has never been so easy, and it’s the kind of self-care that actually fills my cup with minimal effort. Love the music, love the ability to reconnect with myself throughout the day when I need a grounding moment. The app makes it easy to have a moment to recharge with hardly any effort on my part, but it’s still effective. \\n\\nThe app sometimes is hard to navigate, maybe it’s just me. I feel like I need to sit down and look through stuff and figure out where things are, and sometimes it will make noise and it won’t be quiet even if I leave the app. Sometimes I’m not in a place to listen to the really calm and refreshing music and I can’t get it to turn off so I’m frantically pushing buttons to get it off. \\n\\nThat’s the only reason for the 4/5, otherwise definitely a worthwhile app, definitely continuing past the free trial.,Helps to realize you can finally succeed at the little things if other things in your life keep dragging you down, you learn to celebrate the little things and carry them over to bigger. :) As a Christian and a nurse working with heavy-care/COVID patients, I\\'ve been changing the affirmations to remind myself that I may not have the energy to start these changes on my own but Jesus can give that to me. He knows all the pain and loneliness and defeat that my patients and I feel. He felt all of those same emotions and desperation and suggest when he died on the cross for everything we\\'ve done wrong, he\\'s there 24/7 when I beg him for energy, patience, love, ask for forgiveness. This app is a step in helping me not get into unhealthy depressed patterns when I leave work. So I\\'m really grateful for it.,Its a bit convoluted. Seems like its for people who want to completely take away any autonomy and responsibility for themselves by having an app tell them every little thing they should do. Sometimes that works but… it works for mindless drones. I wanted something to create for myself, not have it created for me. Im pretty sure I can figure out when and how I drink water thanks… In short, its a gimmick to get your money and to data-mine you. Thats about it. No daily planner should need to have my email. And theres something laughably ironic on an app… for your phone… that is trying to help you get away from your phone and social media… with an app that encourages you to socialize on it. 🤦\\u200d♀️ talk about missing the point… thats how you know they\\'re just making yet one more junk self-help aid to add to the heap of all the other failed self help books and apps and videos and money schemes out there… since theres no shortage of sufferers of life out there theres no shortage of predators like this…,I love this app, it’s the first one that I’ve actually stuck with for more than a few days. It’s not overwhelming because it doesn’t give you a long list of things to do right out the gate. Instead, you get one habit added at a time so you get used to it and comfortable with it.\\n\\nMy only issue is that the morning routine is very clearly made for people who wake up around 6-7am and are working from home or work 9-5 jobs. As someone who works at 4am in an actual shop, it’s really starting to worry me that I might not be able to keep up with the morning routine because I don’t want to wake up any earlier than I have to.\\n\\nI wish there was a function when signing up where you could input your regular work hours so it would be adjusted accordingly and then people like me wouldn’t feel so bad about completing the morning routine in the afternoon.,This is a great habit app. They tell you which habits to start based on what your goal is. What I love is that it’s split up to where you start with the foundational habits. You start so small, but are still so encouraged to where it’s not over whelming so that you can build that confidence. The encouragement helps because then you don’t feel stupid for starting so small. I love this app and have recommended it to others. This app is so different than any other habit trackers and it is definitely the most effective. It’s also nice how customizable it is. You can change the time for your routine so that it fits your schedule, you can delete, add or reorganize each habit. You can also set reminders to help you stay on track. This is such an essential app. I recommend it to anyone looking to be a better you.,I desperately want you to cancel and get a refund for the year that I paid.  This app is fun for procrastinators.  The moment that you become a productive person it is worse than instagram.  They force you to answer their surveys and other time consuming “motivational” things that get in the way of actually logging your progress.  After giving myself a detox for a few months i opened the app today to see how much of my checklist I completed and to log my progress of the day.  After the 8th screen that did not have an exit button a realized how foolish I was to buy this app (I couldn’t even get access to the daily log because of all of the questions) and I put just a pinch of my frustration in this review.  I wish that i could just get my money back because Im erasing this distracting app any way. They really really need an option for people to turn off all of the surveys and add, they are probably selling our information anyway even after we pay for the service. 🤦🏽\\u200d♀️,This is seriously one of the best self help apps I have ever used. And I have only been using it for 5 days now but it has already helped me change some of my habits. You start out slow. Just reach one goal, something small like drinking water when you wake up. And do this for 3 days in a row. And then you build on with other goals. It’s very encouraging and peaceful. I do not get overwhelmed with it. I feel like there are a lot of tools included in this app that can help you be successful. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety, and it is just amazing for me to be able to notice a difference in just a short time.  So far, I’m in love. I wanna give a huge thanks to the whole Fabulous team. Thank you for creating such a beautiful, creative, mind blowingly helpful app. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.,As a person that struggles with a lot of mental illnesses, I have a hard time taking care of myself a lot of the time. Im 20 and I have a hard time remember to even eat. With this app, even without the premium add-on, it has helped motivate me. I went on a break and didn’t check in and I dreaded coming back but then I came back to a huge party for myself on the app saying how proud of me they were for taking a break. It makes me look forward to every step of the way. Proud of myself and even with the challenges, I started to love and appreciate myself more. It’s changed my life genuinely and if you struggle with basic things and want a healthier routine to improve yourself then this is the app for you ❤️ I personally am going to continue using it for a long time.,I have never written an app review before but this warrants it. \\n\\nThey say one of the best things to help with bipolar disorder is to set a firm routine and this app has helped me tremendously with that. I feel like I have accomplished something just by completing little daily tasks and keeping on schedule. It tells you to celebrate your little victories and this is a huge plus for me. Gratification has always been an issue of mine. I love it for that. \\n\\nThe only things that I would amend would be something like a “vacation mode” because when I am away or I have company I’m not always able to achieve each of my daily goals. This makes me feel like I haven’t done enough with my day. The inability to do that task sets me back. \\n\\nFor instance: when it is pouring outside and my goal is to take a short walk with my dog, I am unable to do so and it sets me back for the day. My boyfriend stays over and feels that he needs television to sleep so I stay up later than I want to to “unplug and darken the room.”\\n\\nI also work nights, and I don’t feel like the app properly accounts for that.\\n\\nOverall, though, I love it. I have recommended it to my therapist and will continue to use it for the sense of responsibility and accomplishment I feel at the end of the day.,This is a very helpful app so far. My mind is not very organized at the beginning of projects so this app really helps me to focus on getting myself prepared before each task or project I take on which has been helpful because I\\'ve been a procrastinator since I was kid due to anxiety issues. This is definitely helping me find simple and easy ways to cope with procrastinating and dealing it in small steps every single day. The best part, if you don\\'t compete a task, the app won\\'t judge you which wag key because my habit since childhood was always to judge myself and then I\\'d feel bad or guilty for not completing the task. The app, however, will simply give an encouraging, safe place to retry or start all over again. Great app so far. Safe space to be yourself and make mistakes is,to me, the key.,I really wanted to love this app - I was looking for something to help form habits and make small improvements. This seemed perfect and I pushed forward, purchasing an annual subscription. I regret this. \\n\\nThe user experience is terrible. It’s INCREDIBLY confusing when you first start using the app and it’s difficult to want to use because it’s just so cluttered. \\n\\nYou can only do one journey or goal at a time - which is totally fine - but it doesn’t really *show* you what it wants you to do at any given point in the journey. The app is also super intrusive — if you go to check off an item or complete a task, it’ll suddenly blast out sound with some cheesy letter (the voice acting/graphics are atrocious and make the whole thing feel cheap). At first, I was constantly silencing my phone or quickly closing out the app whenever I checked something off. It’s definitely not something you can effectively use without headphones in non-private spaces. \\n\\nBut again, it’s just sooo confusing. You can see everything you can’t actually do yet (or shouldn’t - as it recommends), which clutters up the entire home screen and makes the things you’re actually using less accessible.\\n\\nI was hoping for something a little more guided, a lot simpler, and a whole lot more focused. Each letter is like 3/4 of uninspired writing mixed with heaps of filler.  I’m really disappointed.,In the past year my life has turned completely upside down, I separated from the military and had been immensely depressed, all the while stuck in my thoughts as I watched my life deteriorate around me due to my neglect of myself and my needs. With the help of trained professionals I have begun to get a grip on my depression, but outside of the medical realm, this app has been exponentially helpful. I feel hope for the future that I didn’t before. When I do my “chores” each day, I feel that I am actually caring for myself in a meaningful way. I highly recommend this app to people who need a little extra help to keep them accountable while developing healthy habits. I downloaded the app on a whim, but it has seriously changed me in a positive way and I cannot recommend it enough.,In the world of he said she said and I don’t like you because of the way you think or believe, it is a breath of fresh air to journey to “The Land of Fabulous”. Here you “matter”, which is all any of us want. I am only on day three of my “fabulous journey”. This journey might take a long time, but being fabulous takes practice. So, stop beating yourself up and start your own journey. Give yourself a present. Tell yourself that you are worthy. Find out how fabulous you can be!! It is so nice to be  where the idea of loving and respecting yourself are not just words, but tangible actions. Over time these actions become habits that will strengthen your core beliefs. The next time someone says you’re NOT, you will not only say they’re they’re wrong, know without a doubt you are FABULOUS.,The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is that I find it confusing. There is so much going on and I’m just starting to understand the flow. But ten days in and I’m still doing my morning ritual. I feel like a need a guide. The app prompts me to do new things but then it said I had to quit the challenge I was in to take on a new one. So I’m doing the “deep work” challenge but I can’t figure out what exactly I’m supposed to do for 25 minutes...just focus on a task? No distractions? And then I accidentally checked the thing saying I’d done it but I was just trying to figure out what to do?\\n\\nPart of what is confusing is that on some screens, the thing you have to do is below the check Mark saying you’ve done it. \\n\\nOverall, it’s a super cool idea and I’m enjoying it. The exploration is sort of part of the fun.,I’m a student and part time worker and I absolutely love the concept of the app. It helped me establish a schedule and routine for myself. That said, I could only do so after I purchased the subscription. I cancelled it before the free trail ended because again I am a student and who can’t be spending money like that on apps. I would use it daily if the premium features were free but without premium you can barely do anything. I really enjoyed the experience during the trail but would never pay for that experience If the app wasn’t so restrictive I would definitely use it everyday. I think more people would use this app if the premium restrictions were a little less. of course still keep a premium option that i’m sure many will purchase but in my opinion i would have really enjoyed this app if it didn’t restrict me so much,I will start by admitting that I was under the misleading impression of how canceling my service worked. However, along with that I was not satisfied w/ my experience w/ the app and I am experiencing distress through having my finances altered in a way I wasn’t expecting. I made all of this clear through the form that they offer for assistance and it’s evident to me that they feel no responsibility or empathy for those in my situation. \\n\\nYes, they make the renewal dates and charges clear, I wasn’t confused about when and how much. I accept that I should have canceled yesterday, but to be so obvious w/ the lack of care of my mistake when you’re charging someone annually, not even just monthly, is absurd to me and telling of the value of the company. \\n\\nThis is a self care app, it promotes a healthy well-being and one of the ways is through reducing stress. This charge is causing me so and it seems their support team doesn’t care and have no intentions to help. It seems very hypocritical given the purpose of the app they run.\\n\\nMy experience w/ the app itself wasn’t even satisfying enough for me to consider keeping the subscription so I’m basically out of money and stuck w/ a service I don’t want and again, they do not care.\\n\\nI can’t support a service that claims to want to better people’s lives but doesnt care enough to help do so if it causes distress to the consumer when it hinders their income.,The app itself is fine, it is well developed and fun to work with. However, it had said that it would charge a monthly fee when the free trial was over and I was willing to pay the smaller monthly fee for the service to see if I still enjoyed using it. When my trial ran out though I was charged $44 for the entire year! I’ve asked apple for a refund bc there is no way to contact the actual app about one, or any way for me to contact them about switching to the monthly fee instead of the annual amount. I’m really disappointed that this wasn’t made VERY clear at the beginning of this is what they intended to do. I’ll update my review as soon as apple gets back to me if this is easily resolved. It’s frustrating though because even apple doesn’t have a way for you to actually explain the situation. So now even if I do want to continue to use the app for the monthly fee I can’t because there is no real way to communicate!! Very frustrating.,There is definitely science behind this app. I’m still less than one week in, but something about it is working. I was in a productivity rut. And I appear to be making progress again. Time will tell but the combination of meditation (positivity) with  incorporating new self care routines is a lovely way to hold me accountable. It’s like I crave that glass of water in the morning. I’ve known for a long time that I needed more water, and I’d go thru spurts and stops. It’s not just that I know I should anymore. This ‘craving’ is different. I don’t think I will want to not drink water in the morning again. The app is a little hokey in places but I like that, it helps me trust its intent. Even if it ends up not sustainable for me, it feels good trying it.  The ME who showed up at work today was fabulous!!,I have ADHD and I thought this app might help me build some good habits. Unfortunately, this app didn’t help me very well. I turned on notifications but it didn’t send me very many and the ones it did send didn’t have anything to do with my goals that I was working on. So just like with everything else, I forgot about it. Made it the three days with the water goal before I gave up on the app. I was already starting to drink water before I downloaded the app, and the app didn’t help at all. I was drinking water because I already was doing it, and then I’d forget to put it into the app. Also you can’t choose which goals to do, it does it for you. Honestly, I would have much rather done something other than drinking water, because I was already doing it, but it made me do water. Also for someone with ADHD the immersive moment things are just annoying, not helpful. And you have to do them to mark your goal as done.,I’ve been drowning in my everyday routine and started realizing that I don’t really have hobbies anymore and feeling like I’m losing myself a bit. So I found this app and man am I grateful I made that decision! This app has honestly changed my life. By helping me isolate small new habits I’ve been able to celebrate small accomplishments and changes that have effected my life in big ways. To stay, my mental health and second, my physical. This app is the must have for those who don’t put themselves first and need to reconnect with who they are and maybe even readjust. I have a few friends on it now too and we do challenges together! I love this app. Get it! You won’t be disappointed! It’ll literally make you want to do better and be better!,This app is absolutely what I need to gently encourage me to meet some goals and form some good habits. With that said I am not fond of apps that nag me to upgrade and rate on a daily basis. The nagging to upgrade fades after a couple days and I’m sure that the nagging to rate will end very soon now that I am writing this. If you can get past the annoyances of being bothered to rate and buy for a few days then the app is totally worth it. I understand that they need to recoup the cost of building this beautiful, well thought out app. No free app Worth it’s salt doesn’t pressure you to buy something at some point unless it has a lot of donor backing from some foundation. Meaning that it’s part of a nonprofit organization. Remember when we were spending big bucks to buy applications and programs for our computers? It’s kind of like that.,Fabulous is both too much and too little. It promises to help me build new habits and build focus but requires me to take part in community stuff and only gives me one challenge to start with—drinking water 1st thing in the morning for 3 days in a row. Then what? Have a good breakfast for 3 days in a row! Wow. So I am blowing my free week with two mindlessly simple challenges and the rest is all on me to take part in the community? I guess? It’s not actually clear to me. The whole idea is to make this self-betterment stuff easier but the first two challenges that take up the bulk of the free week are two of the easiest things to do. If this is what the first week is like I can imagine how underwhelming the second week will be. This app totally had me going for the first day! That “future me” stuff was great! Then on the second day I was like “well, you’re awfully quiet.” Days 3 and 4 were even more quiet. I guess my future self lost interest? Well, now it’s my turn to lose interest.,I got this ap to help keep me accountable with some goals I set for myself. It’s very personalized which I liked but there were some confusing aspects to how to navigate things at first. There is almost too many “features” on your front page. I think it could benefit from being simplified a bit. Now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks, I get how it works better. There are still times when I’m not sure how to get back to something or whether or not I actually checked off a goal or accomplished my steps for the day. The things I really like are the morning and evening reflections and the reminders that help keep me accountable. I like “the journey” though, I admit, I haven’t been progressing and I’m not sure why? I’m accomplishing my tasks so, again, I’m confused.,I enjoy using this app & paid for the premium service. It has helped me increase my water intake, got me back reading for pleasure (which I haven’t done in years), & just generally makes me feel positive. It can be a bit difficult to navigate the app & I missed out on inputting my first two days of success of my morning routine. But I got the hang of it fairly quickly. I’ve only used it for a couple of weeks but I believe these small incremental changes will help me live a healthier life. As someone who is completely unmotivated, Fabulous gives me a much-needed push. It may seem a bit metaphysical & new agey & some of the coaching sessions are downright treacly. But sometimes that’s what’s needed—gentle words that help you extend yourself grace as you try to be better. I recommend this app.,This was very appealing to me from the beginning. As someone in the field of behavioral psychology and education, once I heard this app concentrated on behavioral science, I knew I had to get it. I like that it starts off slow with one goal of drinking water and gradually adds more with praise and nice incentives for those who like stories. I greatly enjoy the theme. It reminds me of the game “Journey” by Thatgamecompany. It’s one of my favorite games and I’m unsure if the similarities were on purpose, but I love that it works with my association with the game nonetheless! I’m confident this app will be added to my conditioning tools considering it’s already getting me to drink water in a relaxing manner, which is one thing I struggle with lol. Looking forward to seeing more :),I really do like this app! As other reviews have stated, for the first time in long time I am actually following through with healthy habits for myself. But what happened to the story? After I hit my 5 day streak, I stopped receiving the poem with the little figure, even though it said come back tomorrow for more of the story. After looking through some posts in the in-app networking feature, many other people also have this glitch. I know it’s not the most important thing ever, but if your team created the content, I’m kinda bummed to think that a glitch is keeping people from enjoying it. (I even purposely blew my streak to see if that would fix it. It didn’t.) hope y’all can get this resolved, but either way—I’ll keep supporting this app!,One thing i’m going to say, this app will not work if you are not truly dedicated to changing your life for the better. If you genuinely want to live a healthier lifestyle, feel better about yourself and be productive, this app is one the best (if not THE best) to use for that. Another thing I want to point out, is that the app is super non judgmental. if you missed a habit for a day or two, it reminds you that it is okay. It’s okay to slip up sometimes! and there’s no need in feeing bad about yourself over it. \\nAlso, it allows you to build your habits one at a time, which increases the chances of it sticking with you for the rest of your life. \\nThank you to the developers for this app. The best purchase I have made in an app.,I am genuinely grateful that I tried this app for the last year, even though I have ultimately decided not to keep it after my subscription runs out. The illustrations and story are AMAZING!! And very inspiring. However, I found that since this app doesn’t use Siri Shortcuts, doesn’t talk with Apple Health, because it seems so technically isolated on my phone, it was hard to not to think of my Fabulous habits as isolated and separate from my everyday “normal life”. This app does a wonderful job of utilizing the psychology of positive habits; I think this app could be taken to the next level by applying some of the psychological principles of how we relate to our phones, why we prioritize our relationships with our phones so highly. Still, thank you for the Fabulous year!,I’ve only been using this app for about a month, but I LOVE IT! I really enjoy getting on each day, checking off my daily tasks, and celebrating the progress I am making. This app does such a good job of educating you, encouraging your and teaching you the true power of little by little. The makers of this app understand and express that real success and change doesn’t happen overnight... or over a week... but rather, it’s taking one step at a time, celebrating the small things, and keep moving forward- even when you experience setback. I recommend this app to anyone and everyone who wants to see their goals become a reality and their lives change for the better!,I am so in love with Fabulous. I have never been more confident in myself or had so much trust and faith in my abilities to follow through with my desires. This app has made it easy to not only set goals and form habits but has managed to transform my thoughts and actions into ones of true belief in my abilities. I have never felt so full of potential and so confident that I will fulfill it. The graphics are refreshing, inspiring, and relaxing and the audio further amplifies those qualities. It is clear how much thought, passion, patience, time, and faith the developers put into making this app a complete masterpiece. I’m full of respect and proud to support you by being a member of Fabulous Premium. You are Fabulous, I am Fabulous, and this app is Fabulous.,before this app i really had a hard time creating healthy habits, i’m only on day 4 but so far the biggest improvement in my life is i’m able to get up and start my day before 3 pm. i like to think of the app as like  a friend, someone who will hold your hand and walk with you every step of the way. This app is also different than many apps like it in the store for the fact of how many tools there are on it. interested in trying yoga? here’s some yoga poses. want to learn different breathing techniques? here’s some. maybe you’d like to stretch better? they’ll walk you through. anything you could ever need in one place to start the journey of self improvement.,This app has helped so much with adulting though I’ve had to restart my “journey.” I’ve been consistent for a week now! Which is HUGE for me! Drinking water, eating breakfast, and doing some kind of light exercise in the morning. I feel my depressive episode lifting and it’s easier to deal with stress and anxiety. \\n\\n*Note 1: there’s a Discord for #Fabulous. I’ve found an accountability partner, which has been really helpful. Link is on their Facebook group page (somewhere in about - I think?)\\n\\n*Note 2: you can’t do a journey and a challenge at the same time. The journey page will turn into your challenge chat page and vice versa. Slightly annoying, but it’s better to focus on building one habit at a time.,This app reminds people to take care of themselves, to love themselves despite all the chaos surrounding us daily. It can be easy to get swept up in the rush of everyday life, and it can be hard to find time for self-care. However, this app is very structured and makes it incredibly simple to create helpful habits and routines. I’ve enjoyed my journey so far, and am discovering that I had the potential to do what I want all along. I’ve always doubted my ability to establish daily habits because I doubted I could keep them up for very long. With this app I didn’t even notice the minute a habit formed, it was so effortless. I highly recommend this app to anyone wanting a very detail oriented self-care app.,I got the app around 2 weeks ago when I was very unmotivated and my days were repeatedly the same. I got the app for fun just to see what actually would happen, and when I tell you my life changed without me realizing it, I mean it. It doesn’t rush you at all, instead it gives you all the time u want, it helped me mentally tbh more which is more important to me atm. I would definitely recommend this app especially if u wanna set yourself a routine for each day. I only have 1 comment, I just really wish we can add our own habits/tasks/goals! And if possible, I can make every day a new task or goal come up, so it wouldn’t be the same routine every single day :) everything else is prefect tbh and definitely helps u as any beginner! 95% recommended ;),I have only been using the free edition, I don’t know what else this app has to offer. But I have checked in every day and it is solid for building better habits. For context, I am a seventeen y/o girl who has recently been emancipated and gotten out of an abusive household. I started from square 1 and this has helped me so much. \\n\\nThe little things in this app help you the most, it starts by telling you to put a glass of water by your bed every night or in the morning (whatever time you chose it to notify you) and if you go through with it...after a week you start to feel pretty good about yourself and are inspired to keep up the good work. \\n\\nThanks for creating this app, I really enjoy it.,Is anyone looking for a great all over health app? Then get this! This reminds you to do so many things and gets you a lot farther in your health. I have been looking for a long time for something like this and this is the best. Usually when I look at reviews, I look for if the app has premium. Yes, it does, but you can still do a lot without the premium. Plus, there are no ads! (At least so far.) \\n\\nI only have one tiny complaint. It constantly tells you directions and makes you press on things you don’t want to. This is an easy fix and it doesn’t bother me much or come up a lot, I just wanted to give a heads up! \\n\\nOverall, I think everyone should get this app to make their life healthier!,So far I am loving it however I forgot to unsubscribe and I was charged and I didn’t even get the chance to use the trial. Therefore, I gave the app a chance since they do not refund the yearly subscription. I started the journey and so far I am loving it. I read a few reviews in Reddit that really boosted my confidence to use this app 100%. Although I was a bit disappointed I couldn’t get my money but I thought about it this way it’s an investment in myself. I have been struggling with making habits I start and then if my days change my habits tend to be broken and I am loving the theme of the app how it tells you stories and the habits it has are habits I love to keep forever.,So I’m just finishing the trial period and am looking forward to continuing. The way everything is laid out and scheduled, along with long term goals and habit building is very well done. It’s nice to finally see some of all the research we’ve been doing on our habits going towards making us better individuals rather then trying to sell us something. The coaching, the circles, the routine, all have a place that really shows and it’s one of the best apps for it I’ve seen. That being said it being a mental health app (hate that term), you will get out of it what you put in. I’m holding off on the five star review to see if the quality stays the same as I get deeper into it, but I must say I’m very happy with it and very very excited for my journey,Immediately after being shown a first task, you have a letter to read with scattered facts, multiple quotes, a video to watch, a map outlining goal stages, a kind of dream-sequence video (which does look inviting), reminders to set up... \\n\\nThe problem I have with most of these apps (or self-help books like Tiny Habits), is they either overwhelm with too much information and visuals at once, or they\\'re presented simply enough, but then come with a list of notes to take, ways to journal, things to do to track the thing you\\'re doing... \\n\\nI love what the app is attempting though, and the mystery it presents and immerses you in. I just think it needs to be simplified. As a graphic designer, we constantly face this in UI and visual presentation in all forms, so I don\\'t say this to sound testy!,I suffer with depression and anxiety, but I have decided to stop taking my medication (please note, I am not a doctor and do not recommend that for anyone and I am not insinuating that this application is an alternative). This app does help me follow a solid routine but also realistic with small steps at a time. Right now I have to achieve eating a healthy breakfast, drinking water, and working out for 8 minutes in the morning three days in a row to move forward. It is a challenge for me to follow basic routines but this app makes it possible to achieve. They also include letters to you for motivation and lots of meditation opportunities! I’m happy I prioritized myself into purchasing this app!,I was looking for a while for a habit teaks app . But this is much more . This is habit builder . I love the short stores . It boost my curiosity . It does not let me to choose too many things at the same time ( that is what I do in all other apps and I can not follow up ) \\nI have not reach the productivity part yet or focused time . But I am so excited to get there . \\nThere is only one thing I wish I could see , the habit builder to wake up early . It has the sleep routine at night . \\nAlso another feature that makes it definitely 5 , is the stories that is narrated with a beautiful Graphic design and makes me follow it up every day . I hope it lasts for the whole year .,The whole app is really busy and has a lot of different avenues to choose from when looking for journaling or coaching. \\nThere’s a lot of ways you can plan out your life- and there will be ways you can track your progress. I stopped using it bc of the reminders and the way I felt guilty for not living up to the app (even though I set the expectations). \\nSince this app seems to target individuals who are working on themselves and may be experiencing mental health challenges I think it’s important to add a little “grace” and “gentleness” in this app- maybe in the form of a bot that’s understanding and not pushy about reaching your goals. I also don’t like how it doesn’t let you skip through the coaching and intro videos. \\n\\nVery rich app- just too much for me.,This is a science-based and brilliantly designed innovative app meant to motivate and support you to be a better you through behavior change and healthy routines. I really enjoy how being off the mark is built into the system and how they incorporate feedback from the check-ins that they prompt routinely. The app does not make me feel bad about not being able to follow through sometimes and even inspires self-compassion in these cases while supporting positive growth through “super-powers” that are empirically-supported. I’m a doctoral student in clinical psychology and from a behavioral science perspective, this is spot-on and so user-friendly! I absolutely love it!,I have used fabulous for some time now and feel the application has made a huge difference in how I do little habits everyday. I can’t live without it. It’s important to me to realize my greatest potential. I use to not meditate which has seriously impacted my schedule. I see meditation as a gateway to see what’s on the other side. \\n\\nI’ve been so conquered by fear and excuses for everything that gets in my way. I couldn’t see myself opening up to anything. Now, I’m still scared but meditating helps. Breathing helps. I used to be wound up tight. Two people i know have told me to “relax”, “it’s all going to be okay”, and “don’t stress”. At first, I had no patience and as stubborn as I am I find excuses. Sometimes I hear, “breathe”. \\n\\nHow can I? But then, I remember to try it on Fabulous and it does help.,I have always had trouble with doing what I say I will do, so having a reminder helps me a lot. This app is so well put together, and I haven’t found any problems with it besides the fact that you can only have one journey at a time. I would want to be able to do more things at a time, because maybe I need to fix more than one thing. For example, I’m struggling with organisation, and motivation. I would only be able to do one journey, which means one of my problems could slowly subside, while the other could potentially grow. Besides that, I would totally recommend this app, you all should download it!!!!,This app is trash. All these reviews must be paid for because the whole design and experience was lame from the start. First off, there’s nothing free about it. You sign up for a free trial and can’t do anything of value until you pay. Second, there’s no support. Third, it’s impossible to get to your account information/settings to cancel your account. Four, the description and introduction to the app was so misleading. It feels very phony and deceptive. I don’t believe any of the positive reviews here are real. Do not download. Don’t waste your time or your money. I did that for you already. Just walk away. If I can help just one other person with this review, please, SAVE YOURSELF! Don’t get this app. Don’t do it! It’s a fake, a phony, A SHAM!! It’s the Kevin Federline of apps (more problems than it’s worth)! Run, hide, dodge, ignore! You’re better than this!!!!,Something about the app makes you want to complete the set goals. I enjoy that the goals start small. Baby steps are encouraged. I most enjoy the daily coaching so far. I sometimes wish I could go back and listen to certain daily coaching when the day has passed but I feel that’s the point because maybe it’s a practice of mindfulness and moving forward. Launching your fabulous moment and being able to kind of journal your journey is also really cool. It’s been a way for me to recognize how I’m feeling on the journey or vent about the journey. Actively checking off my set goals makes me WANT to complete them.,I downloaded this app on a whim as something to supplement my mindfulness practices and it was really helpful. You build a routine for yourself slowly over time, adding habits one at a time to help build a stronger foundation. Its helpful if you need a little extra encouragement to help hold yourself accountable for all the things You “would really like to do, but just haven’t gotten around to starting yet” or if you have trouble starting something and not following through. If you have a solidified mindfulness routine and a wellness schedule of your own that’s working, this probably not for you. If you’re new to the mindfulness/wellness trend, or just need a little extra support as you form new habits, I would recommend.,I think in general this app is excellent. There are a few things that I hope you will take under serious consideration.\\n1) Requiring the members upload a photo and use their full name. Some of what members share is deeply personal. Requiring a full name and a photo is a violation of your member\\'s privacy.\\n2) It should be possible to change your email address. I signed up to trial this to see if I can recommend it to my clients (I\\'m a therapist). I did not know I wouldn\\'t be able to change back to my personal email.\\n\\nUnfortunately these are significant enough that I can\\'t use it or recommend it until there\\'s a resolution. I also would caution others in what they are sharing in live challenges if their identity is not protected.,I LOVED my premium subscription to Fabulous. I think they do an incredible job, but there are some bugs and overall it’s a little confusing as to how to navigate and best utilize the app. In some ways it’s too guided and in others, not guided enough. Needs some clarifying. For example, there are multiple ways to access the same things and it doesn’t check off one way if you access it via another way. So I’d end up trying to check something off as read or done multiple times every day and not quite sure when I had done what I was supposed to. I experienced a couple other inconveniences as well. Really disappointed because I think this app has the potential to be life changing.,What I like most about this app are the guided adventure stories and journaling guides. I’m a visual person, so the colors, illustrations, sounds and storylines keep me engage and coming back. It sets me up as the heroine of my own journey. I love every time I complete a daily habit, I receive the loud gold star sound. It feels so good like winning a prize at the boardwalk. After using this app for some days now and going through the exercises, I feel more confident in completing what I set out to achieve. It also helped me clarify my thoughts by connecting dots in my storyline from past present future and set some new goals. I love this app!,I’ve been down in the dumps lately and haven’t been feeling myself. This caused me to not get anything done throughout the day and I just wanted to sleep and not deal with the world. But once I downloaded this app it really changed my life. I love how my first goal was just to drink water every morning because even that was a difficult task for me. Now whenever I complete my daily goals it makes me feel accomplished and happy. This is my second week of using this app and I have a completely new attitude. I’m more energized and healthier than ever and I’m just getting started! I highly recommend downloading right now!,I’ll be honest, I don’t usually write reviews. But I’ve used a lot of different habit, mindfulness, focus, self discipline and general life improvement apps. Nothing ever really stuck; it might work for a short time but ultimately they were never engaging enough to really override all the mental fogs and internal struggles that lead to the need for them to begin with.\\nThis ones different. With the carefully laid out paths and attached stories, I actually find myself coming back day after day. And the pacing has been just right to not overwhelm things. Highly recommend at least giving it a try to see if it’s for you.,I’ve tried quite a few apps, and none of them really felt like they fit into my life. Most of them are just naggers. Often, I ended up feeling worse for having attempted it than if I had just skipped it.\\nThis one is very different. I feel like I have a coach with me all along the way. I feel very accomplished every time I do something better for my life. All of the goals are in small increments but are very empowering. I have come to look forward to celebrating the good things I do each morning and evening, as well as the regular coaching.\\nI really feel like I am on a path toward permanent improvement.,The intention of this app is on point. The mission, the graphics, the quality, the fact that there aren’t glitches are all fantastic. However I find the app and the sections hard to navigate. Confusing. The app signals 6 notifications but when I Open it nothing indicates notifications pending. Also the checking off of tasks or goals is weirdly arranged. Is it a check off or a fabulous moment? Or both? The coaching and other extras are also oddly placed. I’m hoping navigating the app becomes easier for me cause I’m really loving the results. For the record, I’m very tech savvy. I don’t know why I just can’t seem to flow through this app. Still highly recommend it,This app is difficult to navigate and messy, which if you’re trying to build good habits is bad. I would go as far as saying if you have anxiety this app might trigger it. While trying to use the app I’m just overwhelmed with constant random substance-less features and it becomes difficult to even do basic navigation and get back to where you just were in the app, there’s no clear direction,  constant pop up style interactions and animations clutter and confuse. \\nIt’s a shame that distracting, messy, unclear design was chosen over functionality (exactly what people who need this app need). \\n\\nIt also asked me what I want to stop using in the questionnaire, social media was one of only 2 options so I picked that, anything I do on this app it asks me to share on social media. I downloaded this app to improve myself, Im not interested in giving you free advertising, and that shouldn’t be on the table anyway for a user that has flagged social media as a trouble area.\\n\\nPerhaps worst of all is that It has faux science, for example, it based a bad habit section on astrology, apparently I drink too much coffee since I’m a Gemini. I’m serious this was in the app, very very very disappointing for a ‘science based’ app\\n(the behavioral science is all solid),I’m someone who procrastines everything. About my work, my health, my mental health... Fabulous helpes me improve myself in many ways.\\n💛 The app’s design is beautiful\\n💛 It’s kind of color coded (which is the only way I can plan my stuff)\\n💛 It has pretty illustrations, very motivational videos, letters, and quotes\\n💛The journey is so cute with its stories. \\n💛You can create your own routines or follow fabulous routines (morning routine, evening routine etc). I recommend don’t overwhelm yourself with so many things to do. Start small. \\n💛It has challenges like reading challenge, yoga challenge, self-love challenge, which are surprisingly fun. \\n💛It really knows how to encourage me. I started with little steps (such as drinking water in the mornings) and I’m eager to continue! Right now I’m having my breakfasts, doing morning excersizes (or dancing to happy songs), journaling before bed, meditating between my study sessions... \\n\\nAt this point I’m considering to buy premium. I believe it’s worth it and I definitely recommend fabulous~,I was gifted a Golden Ticket and as soon as one week was coming close to ending it warned me my subscription was going to end soon and I had to sign up for premium. I wrote to ask for help, but no one ever wrote back. I am NOT on Instagram or FaceBook (which I explained when I asked for help). I checked my account on the internet and it said my account was good until 6/16. But I keep getting messages that it is ending. Very Frustrating!\\n\\nThe app is not very clear and has an extremely frustrating interface. It’s suppose to help someone feel successful — instead it has made me feel like a failure. I never write reviews - let alone a bad one - but Fabulous makes it impossible to reach someone to get help — AND when I followed the protocol to get help, no one even responded. And it’s been almost a week. Very disappointing!,I’ve been using this app on and off again for 1.5 yrs. I thought after I bought the premium subscription the layout of the app would be easiest to understand since more features would be open but no, still confusing and most recently i was dropped from a challenge I was pretty far along and engaged in with the community- that was demotivating. Furthermore some of the additional widgets like workouts and meditations that came with the premium feature aren’t working - buggy, no sound or no image. Submitting feedback to try to find a fix took a very long time to find who knows what black hole that went too. If all features worked I could give a higher rating and get over the awkwardness but right now...nope nope nope,When I am falling asleep...that’s a precious window of time. During that time I cannot be woken up unnaturally or I will be up for the rest of the night. This app, an app that claims to help you create a better routine get better sleep and wake up refreshed, literally sent me a notification when I had my phone on do not disturb and the sound somehow broke through the do not disturb this insidious disgusting happy music this app plays woke me up right as I was falling asleep and I could not get back to sleep for the rest of the night. I have no idea if this app is any good or not and I guess I will never know because I will never allow this app on my phone again the music is revolting and jarring and should in no way shape or form be able to play on your phone, loudly, when it is on do not disturb.,The service is stellar, but I’m beginning to feel very uncomfortable with the amount of notifications, the inability to control which notifications I would like to receive and a prompt when I finally turned notifications off that they were “required.” I love using psychology to help improve myself. I do not love having behavior manipulation happening through constant notifications. It seems like these are at odds with each other. Are you providing a service that encourages me to improve my life beyond my phone, or are you actually encouraging me to be digitally engaging more, leaving space to disengage from my physical well being?,I love the idea of this app and have tried it twice, but both times I was pushed away by the overly abundant encouragements/motivational quotes/suggestions/etc. For example, the first routine they suggest is drinking water every morning, which is great, but every time I check the box, first I get 3 seconds of screens saying you did it/way to go/other stuff, then 3 seconds of showing you the calendar, and finally another 3 seconds of “would you like to share your journey?” with animations... this is just too much. It’s just drinking water. It’s a private journey. No, I would not like to share this with anyone, and I’d rather to be able to go on with my day after checking that box instead of spending another 10 seconds on this app looking at dumb animations.,I have a really hard time with making a routine and staying in it. Fabulous gives you great small habits to build upon and gives you such positive support that you keep wanting to do it. For me it almost feels like a video game. But instead I’m leveling up in life 🤣 it’s helping me learn more about myself and take care of myself in ways I’ve wanted to for years. \\n\\nMy biggest issue is I always do too much change all at once and then don’t keep up. Fabulous has taught me how to take things one step at a time and celebrate my little accomplishments. Can’t recommend enough!,I’ve tried other goal setting/habit building apps and they don’t provide the context my brain needs to be useful. The beautiful animations, the colors they chose and the language used all make me want to use the app. The app provides the initial habits based on the goals you choose and holds your hand through each step, suggesting things that will help you stay on track. The only thing I think that is missing is that i I sometimes forget to indicate I’ve done something until it’s too late. I would like a way to go back and add it later with a note that I forgot.,I’ve only had this app for a week and it is already changing my life! I’ve been consistent for an entire week now because of this app. I love everything about it! From the small little added changes to my daily routine to the encouragement I receive from the app and the online community where others can uplift one another!! To the creator of this app, I want to sincerely thank you for this!!! I usually never take the time out to write a review but I had to because I feel AMAZING!! God bless you all and everyone who decides to try this app! 😊🥰,I have been working to develop new habits and reinvent myself for the better and came across this app. I have only been using this app for a week now but it has been so amazing!!! The helpful little points and stories and habits that are forming are so tiny and easy but making such a difference. And when I doubt that I’m doing enough or the rite thing it’s great for reminding me that I am. The mountains are built out of rocks and cities built out of individual stones. \\nThis has been such a help! Excited to see how great it will get and how great I will get! \\nEnjoying the little things 😊,I’m 11 and I’m middle school. With that it means I’m undergoing a lot of stress and bad habits. I first found Fabulous on Instagram at first u was skeptical and wondering if this was actually going to work and well I was right. I download the app 4 days ago and I already quit 2 bad habits Fabulous improves a lot of things like sleep schedules, better well-being, and fitness. I’m really proud of myself and glad I found this app the only bad thing is the subscription and this app should be free but then again success comes with ups and downs. Overall I say download it it’s a really good app and you won’t be sorry.,I’ve tried sooo many apps to establish routines in my life and this is by far the best app I’ve used for that. It encourages a step by step process that makes it easy and attainable to actually start and keep routines. I’m also absolutely in love with the graphics and stories on this app! They really do brighten my day and makes me feel like I have my own personal cheerleader :) If you’re struggling to establish routines, if you are tired of trying a failing with new routines, then this app is perfect! I am actually sticking to my routines and it’s all because this app has made it so smooth!,I started using this app about two months ago when I retired. I have really enjoyed it and found it useful in preventing me from living my life in front of the television. How do you specially enjoyed the daily coaching and passing along what I was learning from it. But at least in the mornings, daily coaching has disappeared. \\nI am greatly disappointed in the product support. There is nothing in FAQ that tells me how to deal with this. Support staff has essentially responded \"get in line.\"Literally, they said we will respond to your request in the order received. Nothing since, in over a week. So I am left to seek out my own daily coaching and relay that. Please help.,Re-read the title, because it’s true. Fabulous has you start with something small and silly...but begins, ever so gently, bit by bit, explaining the reasons ***why ***; the theory behind the practice. THAT’S a gem. That one idea (spoiler: reinforced small pushes; not big pushes) translates across behavioral decisions. And then you begin, again, one (or maybe two) small steps forward toward more gems. \\n\\nPerhaps you don’t know what “forward” means or is. \\n\\nThat’s ok. \\n\\nFabulous has done work on that and can help you select your path / journey; but, get this, also help you re-direct your journey (even just temporarily) when need be.\\n\\nI’m in the neighborhood of 45+ days of Fabulous.  And I’m doing fabulously. \\n\\nThis is the only app I’ve ever actually purchased after the free trial; this is the only review I’ve left ever. Don’t download the app and then delete it right away because you think it’s silly. Go with it for at least five days. Then decide.\\n\\nFabulously yours,\\nStephanie,Three cheers to Fabulous! I love how it breaks all these impossible-seeming tasks of ‘better living’ into bite-sized chunks.  I live with OCD and depression (both diagnosed) and self-care (the boring, required kind) seemed impossible for me.  It’s so weird how I actually look forward to completing tasks.  The way the app is designed makes me feel really supported (even if it may just be AI).  It’s like having someone cheer me on for the little things it makes me actually want to live better.  I was hesitant before signing up for a subscription, but in the end I’m so thankful.  ♥️,If you like organization, motivation and a clear mind this app is for you. I started using it just a week ago and couldn’t wait to write this review. \\nThe home screen is clean and easy to use and you get reminders of your habits throughout the day. So so helpful. \\nIt eases you into habits, there’s no “drink eight glasses of water” right away. You start with “drink a glass in the morning for three days.” It’s so helpful. \\nYou can join groups to help motivate you, get tips from other real users and make some connections. \\nThis app is a saving grace for me and you should get it too.,I highly recommend this app!  It lines up well with all of the research I’ve seen on forming habits, and the way you can organize the habits is unmatched by anything else I’ve seen. It really helps my ADHD brain focus and build/stick to new behaviors.\\n\\nOnly think I’d wish they’d do different is not pop up as much stuff beyond the habit action items.  Maybe have a once a week inspirational message or whatever but mid week, I’m just trying to get through the routine quickly, not trying to have an immersive experience every time.,I love how it introduces small habits and does not introduce too much until you have truly solidified a habit. In the first 20 days I\\'ve focused on drinking water, exercising, and having a healthy breakfast as my morning routine. I\\'m happy about the subscription, and really want to introduce sustainable, positive habits into my life with Fabulous. Note: If you switch phones during your subscription, you have to re-download information in order to be able to view the letters from your Journeys. It took me some time to figure this out, but it\\'s in the settings.,I recently reached my breaking point. I have every opportunity to get into shape, do better at work, enhance my relationships, and just conquer the small things that feel really, really hard. About two years ago I took responsibility for my mental health and started anxiety medication. This changed my life so amazingly, that I was ready for the next step. I wanted a routine, but I get overwhelmed so fast. Other apps became too much of a chore, or asked too much to start. I like this this app actually tells me to slow down, it’s working. So far so good! I do recommend.,This app is beautifully designed. Whoever made it put lots of time, thought, and energy into making every detail perfect. It is filled with motivating messages that actually make sense. Small snippets of videos that give you encouragement and motivation. There are different “paths” to take and little goals to reach along the journeys. This app appeals to my need for goal accomplishment and ease of access. It makes creating healthy habits fun and exciting. I am one week in and excited to better myself through new actions,A lot of habit/exercise apps I use come with a lot of pressure. Not sure if it’s me or not lol but I know I got stuff to work through. Fabulous feels like a safe space. Their cute drawings and cartoons and little notes of encouragement make me feel safe and like it’s ok to go off track for a day—they put me back on track with the same notes, same motivation, same encouragement, so I feel like I’m still doing ok for starting over. It’s a great feeling. Try it out if you feel like other apps aren’t working. It may help, it may not, but I think it teaches you a lot,I’m 8 days in and absolutely loving it! This is honestly unlike any app I’ve ever tried before, which I think is why I love it. You can really tell how much time, science, and love went into creating this app. It’s not always the most intuitive to navigate, but it’s absolutely worth it and doesn’t take long to figure out. I’ve been attempting and failing to do this on my own for years. It seems so simple, but building a new normal is never as simple as it seems. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to find creative ways to build new, healthier habits.,I came to this app because I would like to launch my life into the next phases of growth. I was impressed that it modulated the \\'when\\' and \\'how often\\' of adding new habits, and it even comes with new routine sets pre-built.  \\nUnfortunately, the app is very cluttery and visually distracting. It creates false storylines and posts complicated moving graphics on every page of the app. For someone with ADD, it\\'s visually overstimulating, and it distracts me from forming my own neurological links and memories surrounding my own life story.  Visually lovely, but not useful for quick and decisive action.\\n\\nThe app also notified me daily about tasks that I had already completed and checked off, which undermines the sense of accomplishment.  Disappointing and frustrating.  😕,Whenever this app is advertised it is a clean and simple UI where you simply check off your daily habits. SOUNDS FANTASTIC\\n\\nActually using the app entails closing out of or reading through tons of \"motivational\" popups and weird letters of encouragement. These might be nice if they didn\\'t appear right when you were trying to fill your check list. Make them an optional little side notification to explore, not a requirement to use the app.\\n\\nYou can\\'t add more than 4 habits to your list unless you pay for premium.\\n\\nYou cant go back to the morning/afternoon if you forget to check off the habit then (even though you did it) which then messes up your progress through the app (which allows you to unlock extra habits and features) \\n\\nThere doesn\\'t seem to be a cohesive place to look at progress in a meaningful way, instead there are \"chapters\" that are nature themed and reminiscent of candy crush levels. \\n\\nI was so disappointed by this app in the same way I am often disappointed by predatory game advertisements. \\n\\nI hope they do an overhaul and get rid of the excess baggage.,This app is awesome! I have nothing bad to say about it, other than I wish it would save images for you and wouldn’t go to the next page on its own. I have two young kids so sometimes I can’t read as fast as it takes it away. But overall I’m happy with my progress, I love the way it’s set up and the soothing sounds it comes with it! Tomorrow is my last day of the free trial, I’m hoping I can buy for the year but if not I’m not sure how this will go. Hopefully I still have a good amount of access to the things premium has for you.,Only a few days in and I’m really enjoying the app. It’s amazing how the small changes really do make a difference and add up to big feelings of improvement. \\n\\nThe only thing that’s a bit frustrating is how often you’re prompted to “share via [instagram, text,... etc.]. I did this as more of a personal goal for me, not as a way to share with the world. I want to be able to save the fun daily images, not have them be shared in order to save. \\n\\nBesides the sharing aspect, the app is wonderful and the storyline is enjoyable. I’ve already made progress with my husband following along as well!,I enjoy the positive effects this has on my day.  \\nA few months ago I stumble across this app, downloaded it, but never set it up. I was cleaning off apps on my phone that I no longer use and decided to check this one out a bit more. I am very happy I did. This app is wonderful. I love everything about it. It is positive and makes you feel happy. It nice to have the encouragements and compliments as you complete items. I really like how it starts off slow so you are not overwhelmed. Great design and functionality. 😊,It’s weird, because in the beginning, it gives you the choice of “Male, Female, and Non-binary,” which I think is great... but as a guy, I think it’s a little weird that when the app shows you “you’re future self,” it’s a silhouette of a teenage girl with a short skirt and pigtails. \\n\\nI love the idea behind this app, and it’s beautifully designed, but as a guy, it’s distracting to see the graphics constantly showing me as a young girl. Why even bother asking our gender in the first place? \\n\\nI still think it’s a 5-star app, but unfortunately, lacks gender neutrality in the design.,I’ve used a lot of these types of apps. While this concept is very intriguing, there is still a lot to be desired and some bugs that need to be worked out. I’ve reported two so far and have yet to hear back. \\n\\nPros: \\n- It starts you out with easy to attain goals\\n- There’s a social aspect (though the post I submitted was lost and there’s no where to view your own posts)\\n- let’s you customize your routines (can’t seem to delete the one you want though, at least for me. Submitted this to support and waiting for a response still)\\n- a lot of variety to choose from for adding to your routines\\n- comes with challenges (like cutting sugar, alcohol and even live challenges that let you participate with others)\\n- not toxic positivity \\n\\nCons:\\n- There’s a social aspect \\n- the reminders could be more “pushy” \\n- support is lackluster\\n- the price is pretty high and in my trial so far I’ve yet to see the $50/year value (but I still have a few days left)\\n- the guest passes you give out are a 30 day trial when your own trial is only 7 days,I recently got the app and since the yearly price was so reasonable I got it. I heard many good reviews. Every single one is true. I have been using the app everyday for four days. I look forward to opening the app. It’s very therapeutic and I love listening to the music. \\nThey start slow with the goal, so you don’t become overwhelmed. The reason I ended up quitting the other goal apps was because I would put every life goal I wanted to accomplish and would be wanting too much too soon. On this app I feel guided.\\n-Danielle,Normally, other Apps provide a checklist or ability to set reminders. But this App has a wholistic approach to building Good Habits and addresses the right questions , answers why and how a particular habit will help, and much much more so I don’t need to search in multiple sources to get the information. These Habits seem simple at first but the best part it is provides the flexibility to Add as many Habits as you would want to your routine and customize them. And to actually see your streak, gives a perspective on what can be improved on,Fabulous let’s you select the goals that are right for you at this moment. And they give you lots of encouragement through coaching, reading positive quotes and reflection on your journey. I really like the pace of this program. I have used another program that is similar to Fabulous but I felt really pressured all the time and the set up was not user friendly.  The daily readings / information/ reflection provided were like Tinder Swipe. So Horizontal. I prefer my information to be read in a verticals way. Like Facebook.,This app is so nice, it actually makes me feel like it really cares for me and wants to see me success. I’ve been using it for pretty much a week now and there aren’t annoying adds or subscriptions so far. I highly recommend to get this app if you’re trying to build habits and change ur life. The animations are so cute and and there are poems and little short films to explain why these habits are important. Overall aesthetic of this app is a solid 10/10. The app itself is a solid 10/10. Try it!,I have the bad habit of trying to change everything at once. I still do that, BUT this app helps me remember that even being able to do a few healthy things at a time can be good enough. Good tools to keep up momentum and articles to explain why to do the things. I feel like even if you don’t do all of the things consecutively as long as you’re doing them at all is still a step in the right direction. Looking forward to the rest of the exercises and stuff.,So far it’s been good for helping keep me mindful of staying on track to develop new habits. But I don’t like that it pushes me to use the immersive experience first thing every morning. I have an 18-month old kid that does not allow for me to hear the immersive experience and I am not going to put earphones in and listen before I’ve taken care of the kids’. It’s a beautifully designed app but maybe too beautifully. I think for busy moms it would be better to have a simpler way to interact with the app and then allow us to have the immersive experience when we have a moment to really engage.,This app has helped me SO MUCH! I’ve been struggling to prioritize and stay focused to get my life in order. Fabulous has helped me take little steps and feel good about myself while doing so. I had the app years ago, but didn’t do much with it. It is totally updated and SO much better. Now, instead of going on social media and wasting time looking at everyone else’s life, I’m focused on me! For the first time in my life I was able to stay focused and for DAILY healthy habits for 2 weeks straight! Everyday I look forward to my next challenge!,Love the subtle mechanisms Fabulous puts in place to hold you accountable. It dissuades you from adding a second habit until you’ve been going strong on your first one for a full three days, preventing the “over commitment and under delivery” cycle I’ve run into with other habit trackers. When it came to “eating a good breakfast,” Fabulous checked in to make sure I’d thought about what “good” means and even created a reminder to buy the necessary groceries. Its poetry readings and storytelling are a little goofy but overall also effective.,When I found this app my cracks were starting to swallow me whole. My depression and my PTSD we’re at an all-time high. The way this app is set up, it’s made it easy for me to refocus all the little things. It’s helped me get back to a regular routine every day. And I’m even noticing that after about 15 years I can write my poetry in my stories again. I highly recommend this app for anybody who is struggling to find their path again. It doesn’t find the path for you but it helps you calm the mind and refocus so you can find it for yourself.,Ever since I got this app I have loved it! It changed my life! I hav a problem where I usually am negative and procrastinate a lot.. ever since I got this I have been doing things immediantly when I need to. I am more productive. I now have a gratitude journal... and I am more positive and am in the process of becoming a kinder person.. I learned abt meditating and now I meditate with this app! I do the yoga on here every day! And it just makes me feel better about everything.. love this app! Really recommend!!!! It also gives u ideas of what to eat and workouts!!,Stay away! One star is too generous. Not even remotely worth the $40 subscription! Explored this app as a potential tool to offer to my therapy clients. App is full of fluffy weird graphics and random stories meant to be inspirational but that have no truly realistic value in helping improve your motivation, or positive mental or emotional change. Beyond the basic principle of attempting to make changes one step at a time, the rest is not even pseudoscience that could even be disguised as helpful. Also make sure you cancel your trial a day before it ends or they will charge you multiple times when you cancel and blame your iTunes account, even if it’s not linked. It appears you have zero recourse for refunds no matter the reason.,I just started using it but I can tell you that even though it’s been a week I have seen a small improvement. It’s silly I know but when I finish a small task or accomplish something it rewards me with nice words. The voice coaching or like the little stories are so nice they are comforting. I was recommended to this app by a friend who was always in such a chaotic schedule and with time she improved and I would definitely recommend this because It has helped to have a clear mind and a good way to start the day.,I wanted to like Fabulous, because I really need routines in my day. I have ADHD and forming habits has been a life long struggle. \\n\\nThe biggest issue is the immersive view. The idea behind it is great, but it is more cluttered and distracting than the list view. There’s a banner at the top encouraging me to take notes, a timer, music, artwork, sounds for everything, and like 3 banners at the bottom I couldn’t even process at that point. \\n\\nSecondly, the app keeps you from doing most things until you have read a lesson and answered a question about whether you agree. They also play cute videos at the end to tell you about your journey. Theoretically, that should improve your commitment to your goal. In practice, it acts as a distracting barrier to the routine. \\n\\nIf I’m doing my morning or night routine, I’m already multitasking by using an app. I don’t need it demanding extra cognitive bandwidth on top of that. Fabulous is meant to support my routines, but more often than not, its design gets in the way.,Ever since I started using this app I find myself feeling the need to follow through with the goals I set for myself. As a busy mom who works full time I purchased this app to encourage me to take time for self-care. I can honestly say this app has helped me in so many ways and I am already beginning to feel healthier and happier. I would give this app a 6/5 star rating for being such a genius idea and it has research to support the concepts taught. I’m excited to continue my journey with Fabulous and watch myself grow into a healthier me!,I have tried a TON of well-being apps. This is the first of them that once I skipped a day I actually found myself wanting to go back — and not because I felt guilty. It is actually enjoyable and not nearly as cheesy, unrealistic, of or overbearing as others. Nice to see that they include the latest science and theories behind sustained behavior change and that they include references to people with kids (most apps seem to ignore that app users may also be caring for unpredictable offspring). Overall incredibly impressed so far with this app!,I struggle with bipolar depression. Some days I can’t see the positive in life. I can’t stick to a schedule bc my mood can be all over the place. This has absolutely made a huge impact in my everyday life. It holds me accountable but in a gentle and slow way. This way it creates a change that sticks. I’ve only had this app for about a week but I can’t imagine not using it every day. Don’t judge it on the first day, bc there is a learning curve. But once you get it, it truly is life changing. Thank you Fabulous for creating this wonderful app ❤️,Finally an app that doesn’t blow up my phone or suggest changing everything at once. This app started so small I almost laughed- then realized this is exactly what I need, to prove to myself I can follow thru with such basic acts of drinking water when I wake up. I’m on day 4 and have enjoyed the coaching, the availability to write notes to yourself, and it even stops me from overloading my plate (suggests to give myself more time experiencing the morning routine before adding an afternoon/evening schedule). This will be well worth the fee.,I am feeling fabulous already! I love all the motivational letters. I do really well when I don’t set my goals too high, and Fabulous keeps reminding me to take baby steps. In the past I have always tried to do everything all at once, and then fallen off the wagon when it is all to much. This app is reminding me to start small and slowly build up my good habits. And it’s working! The beautiful graphics, bright colors, and soothing voices help as well. This has quickly become me favorite app, and my favorite part of the day.,Okay but seriously. I did couple using this app with going to a facility that helps people with my issues. I went through a traumatic experience recently and I have healed so much. I’m doing so much better and this app has daily and even hourly encouragement!!! I’m so proud of how far I’ve come. I’ve made a lot of progress. I went from not being able to eat (due to lack of nutrition) and now I can eat 2 full meals! I am bringing myself around good people and drinking more water and eating good food. I’m feeling so much better.,You can’t control your goals, it just tells you to drink water every morning. Navigation isn’t great - reminds me of Candy Crush in how busy and overworked it is. Every time you click something, several windows pop up and none give you the information you’re looking for. Overly wordy, sends you “letters from your future self” that don’t relate to the goals you’ve selected. I selected focus-related goals and it kept sending me health-related motivation (fitness level and drinking water). The app has beautiful illustrations and a lot of information, but it isn’t usable. It could be pared down into several other apps that would work better.,Nothing has worked in the past for me. I’m an over-intellectualizing perfectionist who is a touch too cynical. And yet, is was this colorful, narratively-driven, and deceptively clever app that found me at the right place and the right time and has been successfully helping me to create structure and find gratitude in my life. I’m on week 4, and I can already feel a massive difference... so massive that I’m telling you about it. I hope this app, or something else, makes a difference for you too.,As someone who shudders at the idea of structure and repetition (yikes, sounds boring!) this app was made for me! It keeps things novel and I look forward to checking off each task every day and seeing what the app has to offer me next. There are so many choices for challenges and opportunities to build habits that I know I’ll be using this app for a while to stay motivated. Also great to know that it was developed by university researchers, and I can tell the science-based approach is having an impact on my daily routine!,This app might be great for someone who needs intensive coaching, but as a goal-setting and habit-tracking app I found that it suffers from ‘feature bloat’. There is a lot of content and functionality but it’s not organized way that makes sense, and I would often get lost and frustrated trying to do the simplest things or get back to where I was before. For example, I would accidentally click on ‘fabulous moment’ and get trapped in...I’m not sure what?? Anyways, the worst is that I somehow accidentally subscribed for the premium version, and now I’m out 40 bucks that I will never see again, and there is no way to cancel. Will I get fleeced for another 40 bucks in a year? Only time will tell...,I love that this app is motivating me to create a morning routine first and slowly add in more habits to form my perfect morning routine! I’ve never been a morning person before but now I’m starting to wake up earlier and get up quicker, though I still lean towards being a night owl at the moment, I’m only on day 5! but I’m improving my life slowly and it feels great! I highly recommend to all my friends and never write reviews but if I can help even just one person with this review it’ll be worth it :),I often feel that I am surrounded by impediments to completing tasks and pleasures in my day. Fabulous helps me to accept these obstacles, interruptions and then refocus. Not because my goals are more important than the impeding instances (though what can you say about technology and communication failures🤦🏻\\u200d♀️)but because my selected tasks and goals have value and significance also!!!   Also I am always amazed that this App affirms my essential nature. It is comforting to think that those who created this App seem to ‘get it’ from my perspective! In a world of dissension abounding the App is a refuge for me.,I haven’t been using this app for long, but it sure has impressed me enough to want to stay on. After completing my new habit on the first day - drinking water as soon as I woke up - I felt better and was smiling! I like the questions they ask; the chance for us to choose our new habits and think about our goals; the way in which this is done with little stories, wonderful music, encouraging statements; and the reminders to make changes slowly. Thanks Fabulous for being fabulous!,Missing one star only because of a suggestion. I’d like to be able to buy features a-la-carte with one-time purchases. I’d spend a lot more money here in the app if there were features to buy in here seasonally to collect and keep. I want on-time add-ons. \\n\\nI love this app because it is visually very pleasing and rewarding to look at and I love how eloquently the stories and descriptions are written. They really engage you and game-ify your habits and make them deeply and genuinely rewarding and motivating. Very artfully done in the  imagery and the written scripts.,I am so impressed by this app.  I was in a place where I wanted to be told how to be successful without any preconceived notions of how to do it (or else I wouldn’t need the app).  By following the recommendations and keeping an open mind, I’ve been very successful at maintaining a daily routine that has made me more productive, less stressed, and healthier.  The design is a little different so it took a little getting used to but I am so happy with the premium upgrades and have not stopped recommending it to friends.,So far this app has helped me restart the life I want for myself. In reality, sometimes it’s hard to start on your own. Life is crazy, man! However, the slow-build to better my daily life is realistic and just makes so much sense. If you truly are looking for change and do it the right way, slowly but surely. Give this app a shot. My gah, it’s in $5/month. I think you can manage without a cold brew coffee/drink once a month to gain control of your routine.,I can see where this app is going, and I think it could be great, but it’s not how I would go about building a habit. I hated that I couldn’t add my own personal goals to my “journey.” There are specific things I want to change about my life and lifestyle. So I think it’s a great app if you are going for a lifestyle change, but if there are just certain habits you want to make, I would suggest a different app. \\n\\nAnother thing I struggled with is I asked for no motivational emails, as I find them more cluttering and just another thing to move to the trash, unread. But I still get them EVERY SINGLE TIME I mark down a goal for the day. I found it very frustrating,I am someone who struggles to create new habits with my ADHD. I might be the worst! I try so many new ones but fail most of the time. I’ve tried many apps on the market to try and instill habits, but none have worked as long as this one. won’t have it I’ve been waiting to achieve. The Fabulous app is different - the structure makes it possible for anyone to feel successful and it starts out slow and steady. I love this app and I tell all my friends about it!,I’ve had this app for a couple of years. My first year I loved it, but after some major updates the app is full of glitches. It only stays open for about 30 seconds before the whole thing crashes. I can’t read or check off a single thing because it shuts down - it’s basically unusable at this point. It’s already an expensive app to begin with, the fact that it can’t stay open is very disappointing. I’ve tried contacting their help feature several times now.\\nI don’t believe this is a problem with my phone since all my other apps are working perfectly. \\nI’d love a refund if the app is going to remain unusable, but I’d much prefer they fix the app so I can use its features.,I’ve been using Fabulous for almost two weeks and it’s been a positive experience. Daily quotes from distinguished authors, journaling, healthy habits, and community to keep engagement. Sometimes the app feels a little slow, although it helps to keep me focused and remember that using this isn’t about beating anyone else, just joining together to bring the community to that goal of inner peace.\\n\\nStarting to notice all the small ways that fabulous has helped me improve, and that knowing the road that seems easy to walk rarely is.,It’s very good, it’s helped me achieve goals and I only started Saturday night. Ever since then I haven’t been working too much about school or anything in general, it keeps you notified if you tell them to remind you and to me it keeps me motivated to keep me doing the next thing and updated \\n\\nThat’s why I think you understand and you should get this app. Also it’s helped me with stress lately. I even started eating breakfast as one of my Goals for school or anytime.,Wow, I was a bit surprised when I downloaded this app and all the features it has. It really is a life changer if you want to get into self-care and self-love. It has everything, self-challenges, and if you work better with friends you can challenge friends to join you. You can write a bunch of notes and journals about how you feel based on prompts, etc. and there are so many other things I have yet to uncover. And a lot of features are available free!,I never think that these kind of apps would work. However, lately I’ve been having trouble with balancing my life, and it just wasn’t good.\\n\\nWhen I got recommended this app I gave it a try, and at first I was hesitant because it was only giving me a free trial, and afterwards it would be around $30 for an entire year. I did some consideration and and tried the free trial. 4 days later (today) in slowly feeling better about my life, and while I know there is so much more to work on in my life I’m glad I’m getting a start to make it better. \\n\\nThere is so many activities on here to help with yourself, and no matter what issue you have there is always something to help out. \\n\\nAs of now I’m in love with this app because it is helping me become a better ME! \\n\\nHopefully I can give an update to give an honest full review on this!,Do not try this unless you are willing to preview the app for $50! This product did not work for me. I requested to cancel before the free trial was up and was charged the next day for a year membership - there is no monthly option. There is no customer support so you are misled thinking you can preview the app before investing. For an app based in behavioral science, they use tricks to take your money. Eventually this bad practice is going to catch up with Fabulous. Also, the email address in the previous reviews is an “unmonitored” inbox so you get an auto reply with instructions that send you in a circle with no real reply. The only way to get someone’s attention is to write a bad review.,I’ve read a lot of self help on starting habits and developing growth mindsets, so I understand how this app works and know that it’s based on real science.  I’m not learning much by using it that I didn’t already know, but it’s nice to have the app and the community behind it helping me along so I don’t have to do everything myself.  It’s very easy to customize and feature packed but it starts you off small and slow so it won’t overwhelm you.  Try it and see how it feels,I didn’t think exercise apps like this work. Usually I download them and have them on my phone for a while and never use them. This one is different tho. This one motivated me to continue the steps. They start off small so it’s not overwhelming. It’s also very interesting because they give you a story and they give you a piece everyday which makes you want to come back and continue the story. I wish that the premium didn’t exist tho because they have some pretty cool stuff that’s locked for premium only.,I’ve tried several apps like this, and Fabulous is a better fit for me than others I’ve tried because it has the most structure. It does seem quite flexible/personalizable if you have specific goals in mind, but if you’re struggling with routines and intentionality at a more fundamental level (as I have been in late 2020/early 2021), this app requires less decision making at the outset and a clear path of incremental, concrete steps to take toward establishing sustainable routines.,Helps motivate me! I always have tried to write my goals down, but that does not fully help me achieve them. I love using my phone and always have it by me. I go to fabulous to see what I need to get done and accomplish any tasks I put off, instead of endlessly scrolling through social media apps. I like that I can form habits and create new ones with this app. Keeping a log of my accomplishments without having to reach for a pen and paper is an even bigger plus!,I tried this app a couple years ago and lost interest pretty quickly. It’s different but familiar now. Of course, so am I. I already seem more drawn into after a week. A big difference is that it seems to be building on itself quicker than before, which I like. There’s a really feeling of gathering momentum rather than baby stepping through self improvement. It feels like a big difference and I’m much more engaged.,I recommend this app to all of those who really want to have a better life because this app help me within the free seven day trial that I had and now I just have the natural habits by myself but I did buy the subscription which really helped improve myself even more. I definitely recommend this to all those who want a better lifestyle.\\n\\nIf the developer (s) could respond to this and make it so lots will see, that would be great’ but I totally Love this app,I loved Fabulous!!! Life changing!  So why the crappy review? A major feature of the app that is critical to keep going- morning coaching has stopped working. I waited a week to see if it would fix them itself. I followed every suggestion that I could find - no luck. Two support requests that only received a “thank you for contacting us - we are experiencing high volume” email followed by nothing for over. That was three weeks ago.\\n\\nIf an app is designed to become an integral part of your day and mental health they have a responsibility to keep it working.\\n\\nPlease up your game so I can go back to loving the app,Finding a routine that works has been a struggle for me. I know routines are good for us, and I’ve tried to start many things before hoping I would find something that sticks to energize me again. This app has made creating and committing to a routine simple and shame-free. Each habit is paired with a visual and musical experience that brings awareness to the moment. It has special prompts and inspirational coaching. Worth the cost! Highly recommend it!,If you can figure out how to customize the app to your liking, it has the potential to be very powerful. I had a lot of morning routine habits already in place when I began the fabulous app, and I have added them to my Fabulous morning routine. With a target duration for each habit, Fabulous helps me to stay on task. Looking ahead to various other available “journeys”, I see the potential for growing myself in the areas of purpose and community after the app has helped me solidify the foundation of my self care habits, routines, rituals.,If you truly follow the plan I can see how it truly brings about change. I have ADHD and this app helped me conquer the number one obstacle in my path. Me. I would always rush into trying to create a routine that encompassed everything right away. With the building blocks and gentle reminders from the app I was able to build my routine one piece at a time and was less over whelmed and have managed to stick with it much longer than anything else I have tried !,Thank you for this great tool!  Have been enjoying it a lot.  \\nA few things however I don’t quite understand.  In none of your emails or messages is there a name at the end.  It’s a bit impersonal I find.   Or are you trying to play ones future self?\\nAlso, the daily coaching is done with such a calm and empathetic voice.  When I got to the exercises I was so surprised about the commanding tone in the instructors’ voice.  Is it on purpose to stimulate ones willpower?\\nThanks and keep up the great work!!!,I want to love this app—great idea and beautiful graphics. The app itself is time consuming. It constantly shows 6 notifications & when I check the app, there is no clear indication of what the notifications are. The menu path is winding rather than logical. When I don’t want to do something the app wants me to do, there is no way out of the prompt other than closing the entire app. I’d like to explore it further, but the billing criticisms are a concern. I have apps for meditation, household chores and my calendar/email battling for my attention. I need this to be a little more precise and clear cut.,After one week of starting with small changes I already feel those habits creating a stronger foundation for each day. I wake up happier and I take moments to be present. I have become more aware of myself and my body. When bad situations creep up, I now feel like I can take the time to rethink of how to react. This program, so far, is amazing! It really encourages tiny steps of habitual change, which is far better than unrealistic big changes.,I love this app! It is helping me make slow and steady changes which is helpful with my mental illness and “all or nothing” personality. I am also dealing with the side effects of Covid - I’m having trouble remembering things. Having a tangible way to check off meds, tasks, and self care is helpful for that “time loss”. Highly recommend to anyone who is wanting to change habits, introduce new ones, or have a better wellbeing overall. Thank you Fabulous!,I stumbled on this app and I’m having a great time exploring and starting with some slow changes but there’s TONS of options. It’s really a great app so far. $35 bucks worth of options, goals broken down and support. There are live challenges even, where you can post on progress and get support. Save the money on a new calendar or diet and TRY this. It even has meditations and stories to help you if you get stuck. It’s really awesome!!,cute at first, but far too slow at getting started. it seems like they’re trying to push you out of the trial period and get you to subscribe. the first habit the app tries to get you to form is to drink water, WHICH I ALREADY DO. it was super frustrating to have to wait 3 days for a new habit, so i deleted the app. having to click through “letters” and “fabulous moments” first thing in the morning also didn’t really do anything for me. i’m not one who gets anything out of reading inspirational quotes, so the whole thing was just kind of fussy to me. sad, because they really could be onto something with how cute their interface is.,I can already tell after 6 days using it the effects it has had in teaching me how to change old habits and create new ones—ones that aren’t just default behavior. Clearly, a lot of time and effort went into making this app. The storyline and writing is top notch. The animation and effects draw you in and just make you feel good. As far as self help goes, this is the next level. Most of all, it’s just fun to use and explore.,I love the beautiful graphics, the animated interactive play, how personalized it is, the map, the focus on journey, all of it! I’m inspired every day and it seems that every time I click the app, there’s something new to read, to check off, or to engage with. Habit building is HARD! But if you choose to give this app a shot, take it slow and let the app lead you- I found the most success with approaching it this way. I am in LOVE with this app!,I’ve used it for a good while now and it honestly is life changing. It forced me to slow down and implement one tiny change at a time and wow those changes stick so much better when I take it slower. The encouragement I get from the app is really great too. \\n\\nThe only drawback for me is that I wish the diet talk and food jugements were optional; as someone with a past history with an eating disorder, I prefer not to have my food choices labeled as bad or good, especially without any warning or opt in/out feature.,It really does help get you to start what you\\'ve set out to do, and using scientifically backed techniques, it sets the foundation of what will help make you the best person you can be.\\n\\nMy only complaint is a tiny one that\\'s kind of like \"well now you\\'re just being picky\", but I do sort of wish that we could save the daily journals and reflections to view later. I\\'ve been in the app for over a year and there have been so many wonderful quotes that I wish I could just pull them all up at once, but they currently disappear into the abysess. To be able to go into the archives and look back on all that you\\'ve achieved and seen would be phenomenal.\\n\\nBut really, I drink water when I get out of bed, my nightly routine is stronger, I\\'m eating healthier, I\\'m exercising daily-- and I can thank this app for helping me form those habits. \\n\\nSTRONGLY reccomend giving it a shot.,Love seeing the growth on a week to week basis, sometimes even a day to day. When a habit settled and implemented, it feels really good. I’m grateful there are some healthy apps focused on improving quality of life. I needed something like this. Worth the money if it can better my life for years to come. Only paid once for life too. I’m looking forward to seeing how much more I can learn, and who I could be in a few years or even next. Pretty neat. Five stars.,My issue is that it isn’t structured or intuitive enough. I find the app slightly confusing, because I don’t know if/when I’m supposed to click on different things to proceed on the “journey” it lays out. \\nMaybe it’s my age (40) —I guess the app is designed for young people who find it really intuitive. (But I’m not new to using apps, either!) I think I would get more out of it and find it more helpful if it was just super straightforward and structured—do this thing today, click here now, here’s what you do tomorrow, now check it off here, etc.,I like it so far! I have only had it for a couple weeks but it send you notifications to make sure you’re doing your daily routines and such! And there is quite a lot you can do without premium! It even has daily plans, workouts, getting productive, coping with serious addictions and more! I really enjoy it so far!! It’s really motivating! Highly suggest you get this app! Even if you just want to start a daily routine or workout!,This app is simple to use! It makes you feel good about yourself! It helps your mental health by reminding to take care of your self! Drink water, eat , take a breather and so much more it helps you be a better person and build habits! This app should get rated more than 5 stars! I really like this app and I have only been using it for a week and it’s already some of my stress in life more bearable \\nThis app is definitely something you need to have downloaded,They have great content! To push you every single day, love the way they organized the journeys! It takes time to accomplish your goals and journeys because they walk you through one step at the time. However for me that’s actually great because you don’t feel overwhelmed or like you’re doing too much. It is easier and definitely something anybody could achieved 🙌 thanks a lot fabulous 🤗,This app is joyous. I don’t k ow how to describe it better. It is affirming and helps you see yourself and your efforts to earwax your goals in a positive way. Unlike other motivational apps, something about this one makes me enjoy using it. I look forward to checking my day’s progress and adding new goals, rather than scrambling to get annoying notifications off of my screen. And the insight provided is fantastic — even the occasional corny rhymes.,I’ve been wanting to set up healthier habits and routines but just simply making a to-do list wasn’t cutting it. I love the way Fabulous breaks down my big lofty goals into small manageable steps filled with encouragement and lessons along the way. I love the communities that are available with daily pledges to certain goals and the aesthetic of the app is wonderful and calming. I 💯 recommend getting this app if you’re wanting to have positive change in your life ❤️,Going into it I thought it was just another stupid app that I saw advertised by someone and that it wouldn’t help me in anyway, but it ended up being very helpful for me. I have struggled so long to be organized and to form good habits and I felt that I was stuck in this rut of doing nothing and having no motivation. Through this app though, I have been able to find the good in the little things and I enjoy using this app everyday.,I like to set goals, but often don’t meet them. I start off strong and then let it just kind of fade. The good thing about Fabulous is that they won’t let you start off and be overly ambitious. Ridiculously easy goals to start and then they add just a little more. The idea is to boost your confidence so you know you really can complete a goal. \\nAdditionally, the app has a beautiful interface and many self-care moments. It’s just what I needed.,I like a lot about this app and it’s working for me so far. It’s not obtrusive. The elements were chosen and designed with care. Not only can I customize how much and what I take on, the app (wisely) encourages moderation. The app is clearly designed for a certain, more privileged, segment of the population. As such, it is missing powerful dimensions that would tap more fully into my spirit and motivation. Perhaps there will be some evolution there. Nonetheless, of the many habit/health apps I’ve tried, this is the first to hold my interest for this long.,I had this App when it first came out. \\nI went a year without it. \\nLife was better when I had it. I was better, focused, happy, productive. \\n  I thought I could do it on my own. \\nMy good habits slowly slipped away and I found myself lacking. \\nMy life was missing something. \\nIt was this App.\\nI didn’t realize how much using it helped me stay on a healthy path. \\n\\n  So I reordered it and I am glad I did. \\nI payed for a year of Prime however \\nI am considering the life long subscription. \\n  I will probably live longer because I enjoy using this App. \\n  I no longer waist time on social media. \\nI still enjoy “screen time” however \\nI prefer to focus on me and my life . \\n  Self-love. It is a thing some have to seek out. I am one of the some who have dedicated most of my life to caring about and taking care of others.  \\n  Fabulous is ME time. Time to focus on my hopes and desires and it has become a foundation on which I stand. \\n  MY goal is to become the best version of me that I can possibly be and grow gracefully into a new mature me.,Between my busy college schedule, work, volunteer, and tons of other things, it’s easy to get caught up in what your doing without giving paying attention to your well-being and health. Especially in the pandemic, our wellbeing has become more important than ever. This app truly is wonderful in that it helps to build positive and healthy habits while also making sure to work with your schedule. I love it!,I am in high school and these are really hard times so this really great to help me remind my self to do thing, to work on my physical and mental health, and unlike others this app still slows you to do things and get satisfied with this app without upgrading it to premium, because it is so annoying to find an app that has so many benefits and is aesthetically pleasing, and have a catch that you have to pay so I am really loving this app❤️🤩,I’m currently 4 days into the free trial and really enjoying the app! It’s been super easy to use. I love that I can set specific alarms and general reminders. As a stay at home of two littles I tend to lose myself in the daily todos. Using this app has aided me in becoming more mindful of taking care of myself in short bursts throughout the day to keep myself going without burning out.\\nI will be paying the $40 to keep the app after the trial runs out!,I just got the app and I must say I do love it, but when I downloaded it, it showed me an option to subscribe to this monthly, which was 3.99, not bad. I can do 3.99 a month, but I can’t afford to pay the yearly price a week from now. I would love to find out where to do the monthly subscription if they only show it once, and I was unsure about the app when I downloaded it but now that I’m sure I would want to subscribe, I can’t find the option that I’m able to afford at the moment,I’ve struggled with the idea of self care my entire life.  I was so used to caring for everyone else from my childhood on that there was no time left for me.  Now I’m making me a priority and the anxiety that I’ve dealt with my entire adult life is beginning to fade away.  I like having a routine that nourishes me.  I go to bed excited about the next day and I wake up looking forward to tackling whatever the day throws at me.  I think I might be heading toward happiness.,This app and its contents is what I’ve been looking for! A group where I can express myself and not be judged! This app has been nothing but a blessing! Ive beaten what I thought were impossible challenges and the have become muscle memory! If you are looking to change your life, lifestyles, nasty habits (because I’m a smoker) I encourage you to join our Fabulous group! I’m still enjoying my 7 week free trial but I know I will purchase! It’s to good not to!,This app is absolutely fabulous! Seriously, the app is called fabulous! I think that this is a cool app for when you’re trying to start something new. When you wish to better yourself! This is one of those self-care apps that does a little more than just asking how your day was. I think this app is awesome and I definitely would recommend it to a friend....if they were ready to start on the mental health topic (R.I.P. them 😒),I love this app! And I have to yet subscribe to unlimited but so far is great! It has several ways to challenge yourself depending how what you are looking to achieve. I love doing their challenges and the app keeps reminding me throughout the day to get them done. It always keeps everything positive and there’s articles you can read about self care and self growth. I would recommend this app to everyone! That’s why i rate this app 5 stars❤️,This app has motivated me to drink a glass of water first thing in the morning, and to eat a healthy breakfast. I have been using it for about a week and a half now and I know that there is much more in store. It eases one into doing more healthy things as they progress. This is exactly what I needed to push me in the right direction. My partner has been trying to get me to drink more water for years now and is amazed that this app could get me to do it.,Routine is incredibly difficult for me to form and hold, and it’s also one of the most important ways that I can care for the particular needs of my mind. \\n\\nThe slow and careful building of habits and routine that this app aids with, and the holistic way it helps me engage with the process has helped me do an incredible amount of work for my health in fairly short order.\\n\\nHighly recommend it for anyone with similar problems!,Fabulous has been instrumental in assisting me to make tremendous life changing habits. Use it daily and TRUST them...I say “them” because it’s like I have a team or family supporting me and teaching me the right way to make permanent change. I wanted to go much faster than the system was going and had to slow down, breath and trust that they knew something I didn’t!! It’s working...go for it and enjoy the fabulous new life you create😍🥳🤩,This is the first review I have written for an app, but I have been using it for three days and love the pace of the app along with the psychology behind it. I am the type of person to want to change, be productive, my best self, etc.- but after a few days my motivation is gone. This app really helps to slowly build habits over time and makes you rethink your behaviors to change in the way I have always wanted to!,Pun intended! Productivity, self-care, meditation, and so much more all wrapped up into one. I would recommend this app everyone, and since I can only speak for myself, I would especially recommend this app to anyone who is in the same position I had been stuck in for a long time, already thinking about changing some habits and needing the extra push to break your goals up into manageable easy-to-follow steps.,I heard good things about this app so downloaded it to check it out. I was so close to actually keeping it and trying it. But then I saw that it, like so many other thoughtless apps, force timeframes on you that you can’t customize. It allows you to customize your wake up time but not the ‘end of day’ time. No. My end of day is not 2am. It’s 10am. I work midnights that’s why I wake up at 6pm. But this app doesn’t allow you to adjust for that. Therefore this app is useless to me and immediately being deleted. I was so excited to try to start making decent habits but if you’re gonna say you’re customizable then be customizable.,I downloaded this app and within a couple of days decided it wasn’t for me and tried to cancel my subscription. The Apple store had no option to cancel, so I did it through the app. I believed the cancellation had been submitted but noticed the subscription still appeared in my Apple store (still with no option there to cancel). I though this was just a glitch that would be resolved. No—I was charged $44 and now am stuck with a years subscription to a dumb app. :( customer service was no help, they just have a useless refund form that directs you to Apple customer service.,I’ve only had it 2 days but I will write a further review. I chose to start this the day my church started learning about revelation. Revelation and the repenting I’ve done really woke me up to the truth that I’m not a great person. (I use to be) but lost my ways. The first routine I made was wonderful. I did yoga in the morning along with some light reading and journaling. Ate a healthy breakfast and can’t wait for this to wake me up again with those gentle reminders.,I tried the app in its beta phase and it was quite decent but I couldn’t stick with it. Whether that was due to my own laziness or the app I cannot say. However, this time around the app is much more robust and I’m finding it very easy to follow the prompts and adhere to my daily routine. I love that it starts with such simple habits like drinking water each morning and only adds on as you feel established in each new routine.,Fabulous is exactly what I needed during a time of change and uncertainty. It helped me through severe anxiety, and taught me to remember the me I really am and am capable of being in this moment, right now, and to be okay with it. It showed me how to embrace my self-worth and embody confidence in some of the most fearful events of recent times. I would recommend the premium version to anyone, it is definitely worth it🙏🏻,So I recently downloaded this app and subscribed to a 7 day free trial. After 3 days, I decided to cancel it, because it wasn’t helping me as much as I thought it would. I had a significant amount of money in my account, and as soon as I unsubscribed, all of it was gone. I searched online, and did pretty much everything to my ability, and it was all leading back to this app. Take a look at the five star reviews for yourself. Those don’t  even look like real people commented those, just bots. If you don’t want all of your apple money taken away, do not download this app, because it will surely empty out your account.,I was obsessed with this app when it had started out. I was hooked and had been doing great with my habits. The UI was amazing. The functionality and aesthetic were so well done. Only certain extra things were behind a paywall \\n\\nAnd then... Suddenly nothing actually useful could really be done anymore without paying for it. I was no longer able to keep my current schedule of habits. The functionality felt less accessible and more confusing. Overall it just became so much less appealing and helpful. I’ve now found better productivity apps. \\nBut nothing will top Fabulous in its early days. :/,I don’t know why this one is better. I’ve tried two other apps that said they worked but they just weren’t for me. I need structure short term goals and gentle reminders. This exceeded my expectations. It’s not hard to use it can seem a little disorganized and it’s presentation but they are constantly making improvements and welcome feedback. With any other shortcomings it’s still producing results. I’m happy,Similar to some (video) games, this app allows you to become part of it in a way that’s magical, scientific, and challenging. The difference is you are the player and the game does not end. The game is your life and how you live it. Mixed with great voices, imagery, quotes, poems, and tasks, it’s like The Hero’s Journey one excepts (or not) without feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes journeys are thrusted upon us, other times choices r involved. Baby steps is the key to this app and I love it.,I really like the app and I mainely use it to count the number of days in row I’m staying consistent with a routine.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the app does a real bad job at counting the days. It will skip some days even though I checked them (and I can go back up to 7 days and actually verify that it was indeed properly reported, but the Golden Triangle diagram would show it as a miss).\\n\\nIt’s frustrating because you cannot edit the past days when the software does that kind of mistakes.\\n\\nI contacted support a couple of time about it and it took forever for them to give me a half baked answer. I don’t think they care about that issue.\\n\\nEdit: after a few more months of using, the bugs are not improving. The counting of the days is all over the place. The app helped me, but I won’t be renewing because of that major flaw.,I seriously have struggled with creating good habits my entire life. I thought I was lazy, but turns out I just didn’t have good coaching. I had considered life coaching but was prohibited by the expense. Fabulous has made making small sustainable change doable and affordable. I love that it doesn’t take up much time in my day but makes a powerful impact in a short time. I’d recommend it to anyone struggling to create change.,So this app is nice in theory, but it\\'s REALLY visually and audibly overwhelming - there\\'s so many bright colors, movements, and sounds and I couldn\\'t handle it. If you get overwhelmed by that kind of stuff pretty easily I would probably look for a different self-care app. Even when I turned my sound off it was really visually overwhelming and cluttered. I\\'m sure this is a great app for a lot of people but it didn\\'t work for me. Also I\\'m not really a subscription kind of person and I think there are other self-care apps that have a lot of the same base functions without the payment.,The app is still new to me but I’m enjoying it. Sometimes you have to cut through some of what’s offered to get the benefits of the stuff that matters to you, but I’m finding the more I customize it, the more I like it. Still in the trial period and not sure if I’ll pay for the whole year... if there’s no option to pay monthly I may let it go, but we’ll see how I feel at the end of the trial.,Fabulous truly has to be the best app I have ever used. There are so many journeys and paths you can choose, therefore customizing this improvement journey and really making it your own. \\n\\nThe app itself does take a bit of time to become acclimated to. I enjoy this feature- to me, it feels a bit of a choose your own adventure book!! Take some time to explore and you will not be disappointed!,I really love this app. When I first heard about it a year or more ago, I hesitated because of the price. \\n\\nBut last week I was ready to make change to see more improvement in myself, so I found this app again. I’m so I love with it & I don’t think I’ll ever delete it. I look forward to getting on the app every day. It’s worth it!! So much personalization to make it feel like your pocket accountability partner!,I’m only 15 and just recently started using fabulous three days ago but I already feel completely better about not only my living environment ( now that I’m starting to get the hang of keeping it clean more often), but my mental status. There’s more along the way and I’m even doing more chores to earn money to pay for premium. I would sincerely like to thank the developers for this app!,at first it was another app on my phone i planned to use but didn’t. the moment i was ready to take my life in my own hands is when i realized how great this app was, i shared it with my best friend and she love it as well. still considering if we should pay or not since some things are available without having to pay. if you’re reading this wondering if you should download it’s the sign !,I can’t put my finger on why but there’s something about this app that makes me feel so much better every morning. I have just started using it but the small steps make me slow down and enjoy my time to myself. I’m so excited to see my next goals and what I’m capable of. No other apps have been this good at hooking me before and actually keeping me on track.,I splurged on a Fabulous subscription during a really rough time. Work was extra stressful, my mom had just been diagnosed with cancer for the second time, and I was falling into some really unhealthy patterns in my struggle to cope. The gentle encouragement offered by the daily coaching messages and the slow layering of healthy routines were exactly what I needed to shore up my inner resilience so I can be my best for my coworkers and my family when it matters.,I’ve only just started this and I am very impressed with all the features, graphics, music and natural sounds throughout the app. I am finding it a bit difficult to find the proper “path” through all the various routes and levels, and over the weekend I “fell off the Fabulous wagon” mostly due to the changes in my sleep times. So I’m really sort of beginning over again. I’m going to keep at it and evaluate my progress over time. I’m optimistic.,The first time I downloaded the app I couldn’t find the motivation to actually start the things it was talking about but it wasn’t the apps fault I was going through a rough time and didn’t /want/ to get better but now that I’ve committed to bettering myself I love this app so much and the storyline keeps me endlessly motivated. The graphics are adorable and I really enjoy the small pictures after you finish a goal ^-^,This app really makes you want to come back and check off your routines so you can see your guy go up the map, read the nice quotes, read interesting articles, and just make you feel great and motivated by just doing the most simple of things! I really like that you also have challenges and different options to click on to meditate, or exercise, or focus, etc \\nReally great app,I signed back up to give this app a try 2 days ago. It seems like a lot of changes had been made since the last time I used this app, over a year ago. The “Free Trial” is a lie. It says the trial is free for 7 days and as long as you cancel in that time you will not be charged. I downloaded the app 2 days ago and today I woke up with a $40 charge to my bank account from this app. I was actually enjoying it so far, but I haven’t gotten very far with it. I was debating about whether I felt it was worth the cost and now I’ve been charged and apparently I have a year long subscription. I’m deleting this app and contacting the developer.,I really love this app but it’s kind of annoying to not be able to turn off the afternoon routine. I don’t need it because I can’t setup a routine for that part of my day with my position. So, getting notifications to start a routine for that part of the day just causes more phone commotion that isn’t necessary. Also, the app always shows notifications but there’s nothing unchecked when I open the app. This happens on multiple devices.,i love how personalized the app is and how it creates a journey that’s right for you. it starts with small habits which progress into full routines over time, building long-lasting healthy habits. this app actually makes me want to continue using it because of how motivating it is. EVERYTHING is perfectly designed and helpful. the only thing is that some features are restricted without premium, but that’s just a minor inconvenience.,I been actively using this app for about a little over a week and I can already notice a difference in myself…..it helps me keep up with all three of my routines and makes me feel better about myself…..another thing I love about this app is if I forget to mark down my routines of let say nighttime I can always go back the next day and mark is so I don’t mess up my streak,I canceled this during the “free” trial, because there was no way I was going to pay for this content. There are WAY BETTER options out there, for FREE. Yet I was still charged for a premium subscription. Fabulous has ignored my numerous requests for a refund. I literally deleted the app after I cancelled my free trial, so I did not use this “Premium” subscription. \\n\\nAvoid signing up for any “free” trials, and be aware if you decide to use this app. There’s a lot of scamming going on here.\\n\\nUPDATE: I’m updating this review to say that Fabulous, despite replying on here to try to save their public reputation, is STILL ignoring my requests.,🥰❤️💕Thanks to this game it let me be myself again I just want to tell you that to go download this game and if you’re getting bad comments just keep your heart away from those comments but it’s just because those people are not happy with your life and just keep your heart from good comments and people that love and appreciate the things in there lives so you guys will thank me later🥰❤️💕,Overall the app is helping me create positive changes in my life. The onboarding experience was personalized and I think the art and UX is beautiful. However after using the app for about a week I find it contains a little too much helpful information. Daily coaching. Nightly coaching. Reminders. Tips. Motivators. 9x notifications. It’s a little hard to know what to pay attention to...which is part of the problem with digital life that brought me to this app in the first place.,For anyone who is lost and needs help getting back on track, or for those who just need a little boost in their habits, this app is the best. No other program like it. I was in a dark heavy place, a lot off track, this helped me build my momentum in little daily habits and get some structure back in my day so I could feel good and realize I can get back on the horse again and live the life of my dreams!,Even if your not, this app if you actually USE it will change your life. I have used timers to help me with my ADHD all my life and this app uses timers and a number of other therapeutic ways of changing your habits. Worth $3 a month, worth $50 a month honestly. But I’m glad it’s affordable for everybody. I don’t care if you are broke, if you NEED or WANT change in your life, this is it and it will give you that.,I tried out the basic version a year ago and decided not to stick with it. Now my daughter and I are both using the full premium version of the app and it’s 100% better. The yearly rate is incredibly affordable - more so than my meditation app. There is no excuse for me not to be successful now. Great graphics, lovely story in the mornings, lots of journeys to explore.,So far, I have enjoyed this app. I don’t typically spend money on apps but this one was so WORTH IT. It has helped me start and stick to routines while also giving me constant motivation. It helps you start slow and gradually build up a healthy routine. & best of all, it helps find the absolute best routines specifically for YOU. I have already recommended this app to multiple friends and family. Don’t hesitate. Get it!!,I think people should be allowed to know upfront so they are not feeling duped. Before I even get to know this product I am already prejudging based on the fact this information wasn’t disclosed upfront, initially. Now I may not know whether or not this is a decent product due to what feels like a scheming tactic to bait into downloading and initially investing time in questionnaire before knowing the pricing “scheme”. I now wonder if I’m gonna be automatically charged even though I don’t believe I agreed to anything. I do not want any drama of removing post-trail charges should that occur...see already a bad taste in my mouth. Counterproductive.,Ok, so it’s not just me. Looks like this app needs help. IMO it’s overwhelming, cluttered and unorganized. There are a couple things I don’t mind. And it’s beautiful overall but it’s not user-friendly. I have no idea how to navigate this app - it doesn’t feel intuitive and I just get lost with no idea how to easily get around or back to where I was. I had high hopes of getting rid of some habits and making better ones but this isn’t the app for me. I paid for premium too so I have it for a year but I won’t be purchasing again. Sorry :( there, I said it. I feel better now.,I’ve been looking for a similar app like this for a long time and I’m glad I found it. I have ADHD and gets distracted very easily. I like that they start you slow with one habit at a time and increase from there so you don’t feel overwhelmed. I gave this a four because I’m a UX designer and I feels the journey of customer and some functionality can be improved so that it makes more sense to the user. Overall, I would recommended this to a friend!,App is great and helpful. The problem I have is when I want to share something from within the app or save it, it only creates a link that prompts to download the app from the App Store, or it just opens the app without taking you to the intended content.\\n\\nAlso, if I want to access previous sessions of daily coaching, I cannot. App just takes me to the latest one. If I read something helpful and I want to access it again, I can’t. \\n\\nCan you please look into this. Thank you,Tried the trial, when through and charged me when I tried to cancel. I figured I’d least try to use it, but it’s horrible. The ui is horrid, and it’s not like I’m old and don’t know how to use apps or anything like that. I’m 24. It’s not acceptable for this app to be so poorly optimized. I can’t find things I was looking and on a previous day, journeys are confusing, there are fifty different screen and none make any sense. \\n\\nI want my money back. \\n\\nDon’t download this. Use a notebook to keep track of a couple of goals and a free meditation app. Better than this garbage that I was charged for against my will.,This app is amazing! You can create routines to help you in the morning, afternoon, and evening! The app also plays calming music to help you through your routines, and you get to choose what your routines consist of, when they start, and how long your routine lasts! You can also connect with other people, and post what’s going on in your life, or whatever you want to post! This app is amazing, totally recommend!!,I’ve used this app for six months now and my life is undeniably changed because of it. I’m healthier, happier, and more productive. I don’t know how they did it, but I actually look forward to checking in with myself and my goals every day. I thought it would be either be boring or hokey, but I’m really enjoying it!  The “coaching” every morning and night is my favorite part.,I didn’t think there was anything that could help me out if this hole. So grateful for fabulous. I’ve made it to day 4 of simple, healthy habits and I can feel my depression dissipating, where there was hopelessness I now look forward to unlocking new stories and completing tasks that are so simple but have huge impact on my energy and mood. I’m also a lover of fantasy, and magic, so this app calls to my heart.,I’ve really been struggling with change and this app lets me set some short term (easy) but it really gets me excited especially once i achieve them. It sounds silly but i don’t have a routine and with kids and this pandemic it’s been really hard. This app makes me excited and it’s great practice for me when I’m really ready to make those long term commitments and really stick to them this time ♥️,I’ve been using this app for three days.  It’s engaging, but I find it confusing.  There are multiple things happening, not sure where to click, if I’m interested in clicking one place but do something else first, I can’t find the option to back.  I think some streamlining could really help.  I’m going to keep on for awhile to see if it improves or if I can glean what I’m supposed to be doing, but for now I’m mostly confused although still curious to keep going.  Good luck if you decide to try this app.,I absolutely LOVE this app, but after three weeks of using it, I can no longer launch my fabulous moments and go through my goals. I have sent messages but have not heard back. I love this app so much I paid for the annual membership. Soon after that, it began having issues. I am hoping to get it fixed because this app has done so much for me dealing with anxiety, depression and a general feeling of always being overwhelmed.,The graphic and audio design for this app is lovely. I found it took a couple days (two weeks?) to really grasp the layout. I still don’t understand the notifications. The content and concepts this app helps track are EXACTLY what I needed. Small goals and gentle guidance really help me to ramp up and feel accomplished. Some of the goals were things I already do (eat breakfast?! Sure!) and that helps one feel like progress is being made.,The first two days on Fabulous, I was frustrated about being forced to take such small steps. Over the last week I have realized that I have always been and all-or-nothing person and that is why I have failed to change in the past. As I allow myself be guided into tiny, incremental changes, I find myself welcoming the new habits I am forming.,I’ve just completed my drinking water as soon as I wake up goal. I splurged on a cute water bottle, bright lemon and glass because I don’t like the taste of metal in my water, and enjoying my water bottle really did help me remember to put it out. I’m not forcing myself to drink out of a metal bottle I don’t enjoy. I also look forward to checking my daily coaching and checking off goals.,With the daily check ins and the beautiful artistry, Fabulous keeps you wanting more. I look forward to checking off my daily goals to see where on the path I am. It starts small and builds to keep habits obtainable and sustainable. Fabulous has become part of my daily routine and I’m feeling lighter already only a week in.,I’ve enjoyed my week of using the app, maybe wi  the more time I will change my review.\\n\\nGlows: \\n- it’s game like enough to make me pick it up and check what goals I have, but not so game like that I am constantly checking the app\\n- encourages you to start small and simple. Not overwhelming\\n- the daily motivators and meditations (whatever they’re called) are really well written and aren’t either too clinical or too new agey.\\n\\nGrows:\\n- I don’t find the app interface particularly intuitive, easy to hit a button and get somewhere I didn’t expect\\n- really hate the voice over thing that happens when you complete goals, but can’t figure out how to turn off\\n- doesn’t seem to be super customizable but that may be because I am only a week in,Short, direct and thought-provoking prompts that helps get and stay focused more by the day. I truly find this to be a way for me to move past and through so many small deterrents that I find overwhelming. I love the celebrate option, the diverse avenues to choose from that help hold us accountable. I have found hope again. Further in, I will update my review, if allowed.,I’ve noticed since the new year started that I’ve had difficulty staying focused and maintaining habits. I got the premium version to help me build lasting routines for health and energy and to minimize anxiety that has been increasing since COVID-19 started. So far so good. I focus on 1 goal per day and try to maintain 3 times, just 3. And that feels doable. There is no pressure or rules just being kind to oneself. Definitely a win!,I like the idea of this app, but I’m not enjoying the lay out very much. There are also a lot of other things I was hoping to get out of the app that I’m not finding, for example meditation and more mental health type of guidance. I’m not sure if this app is starting me off slow to help build up to these goals, or if it just doesn’t have exactly what I was looking for as far as personal growth. I’ll keep trying it out and see what else comes of it. Not exactly what I thought, but also not a bad app.,This app is absolutely wonderful. It gives me small, accomplishable goals, lots of encouragement and most importantly *hope* for the future. I do wish it were a bit more intuitive as I know I’m missing a lot of the wonderfulness contained within as I just have trouble figuring out all of the specifics. Even so, this is probably my all time favorite app. It’s a life changer!,I love this app and I have seen a big change in my mental health since I’ve begun using it. The daily letters are so well written and the daily challenges are all specific and actionable which I find very helpful. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who wants to become a better version of themselves but doesn’t know where to start.,I tend to often forget to focus on myself and this app has really changed my life style. I’m at a young age as I’m 10 and in 5th grade. I struggle a lot with taking care of myself and my stress. This is absolutely Fabulous. It’s healthy for me while also calming. I had missing assignments and it was frustrating it really was and I’m shocked at how I have no missing assignments now. Absolutely love this app so far. ☺️,So far I am enjoying all the habits and tracking I was a little confused at some points. There is an option for fasting tracking that doesn’t actually tell you how to fast. Which is totally ok but it seems like it’s a habit it’s going to teach you. But I am only a week in so maybe I just haven’t figured out everything or haven’t gotten far enough to unlock that goal. I am enjoying the coaching/reader part the most!,This app really helps to lay a pathway of implementing incremental habits in a way that are sustainable. Sometimes the app can be a bit confusing and I don’t always know what I’m supposed to click on next (reason for four stars instead of five). However, the coaching and easy accountability will keep me using it. Plus it’s fun and whimsical. Breaks up the monotony of the day and sets me off in the right direction when I wake up.,I have a yearly premium. The app keeps shutting down. I tried to write a feedback on the app even then I couldn’t finish writing one sentence before it shut down. Almost non of the meditations are able to download. When I start a meditation after 4 seconds it shuts down completely. It is so annoying and I have been trying to solve through the app by clearing my background and it is also updated version. How am I supposed to use if the app knocks me off every second. Not to mention I paid the yearly membership already!!,You guys, this is the best app you will ever have on you phone. Although it is not for everyone because not everyone needs couching to get ahead in life like some of us. I have a positive mind and attitude about any situation but sometimes I need a little couching every now and then and this app have helped me so much. I recommend 100 and 50 %. I gave it a 5 stars because that’s all they show.. I LOVE FABULOUS SO MUCH! 💗💗💗,I really like the concept of this app and think it has a bright future ahead of it with tweaking. A lot of what the app offers is great but the whole layout and UX of it is confusing, chaotic and unorganized. Also, if you’re the type of person who isn’t glued to your phone/reliant on it, this app won’t be good for you. Instead of this app being a supplement to self-care, I feel like I have to dedicate a lot of time to it, which I feel is counterintuitive. I’m glad to see it helps so many people but I will be cancelling my free trial only a few days in.,Just started the app this week and so far so good. I like that I am able to build daily routines for morning, afternoon, and evening and there are reminders for these events. I like the daily coaching the best. I have it set for first thing in the morning and as part of my wind down in the evening. There is also a community feature, I have not posted on there yet, but is is good to see others struggle with the same things I do.,This is a great app, I can track my habits and it is really well made. However, whenever I go into the app to “launch my fabulous moment”, the app just crashes. The screen either goes completely white or it just kicks me off. Please fix this because I really like this app.\\n\\nIf a developer could please respond to this that would be great!,It would be nice if the pictures of checklists were actually interactive (I know that’s a lot of work, so I don’t expect that to change), also some tasks are vague like “focus coaching”, it would be nice to be able to look up what that task means (I think it had something to do with putting my phone on airplane mode?)\\n\\nAnyway, still loving the app so far. Thanks!,I’ve downloaded and deleted Fabulous a few times over the years, but this time around I’ve really opened my mind to what Fabulous can do for me. It can be life changing if you allow it to enter your mind and accept that habits will set you free and the developers really went all out in helping people. I consider it seriously life changing,I’m just beginning And I’m kind of slow at making my routine stick. However, the app seems flexible enough that it won’t be a problem. My motivation is definitely higher. I find the exercises to be enjoyable which is further motivation. I’m really looking forward to seeing benefits... and I know I will. This app may just be what I needed to change my life.,The app is nice, but you definitely would need to pay for the premium features for full use. \\n\\nThe issue is that it lets you go through the process of everything before telling you that the function is locked behind a paywall. Uninstalling because I’ve already tried many different activities only to be told at the very end that my results are locked and can be revealed for $40. Waste of time.,I didn’t think much of the outcome of this app\\nWanted to think it would help me but was like “eh if it helps horaay, but if it doesn’t oh well” kind of attitude.\\nI love the daily motivators and the side pep talks. Very applicable to my daily thoughts and routines. I love how it will encourage me to set routines and i do appreciate not being an enabler or doesn’t help me “cheat my way out of it”\\nIm so glad i gave this app a chance,I have fibromyalgia and having a routine again with all sudden pain attacks is like a dream for me. I try hard to manage my pain and have an active life as much as possible. I try this app for making an extra support to achieve my goal. Unfortunately they completely forgot about people with serious health issues and disability. It seems that they make it for people with mild depression and lack of motivation. I wish they develop it and this time consider people who struggles with chronic diseases.,✨I recently got this app because I was stressed and overwhelmed with school. I had some goals that I just let go of because I wasn’t motivated. The animation and all the little things this app encourages you to do is so helpful. I LOVE THIS. Yes u can pay for better stuff but this has SOOO much available to u without paying. It’s like you aren’t missing out on anything. This is a true friend ✨✨❤️❤️❤️,This app is great in so many ways especially for people who struggle with depression or general unmotivation to complete tasks and feel energized. A down side is that it costs money to use which I think it should be free and maybe just include Ads within the app. Im on my free trial now but even though i love it so much im not sure i will continue to use just because of the money.,This has been my 4-5 day using this app and I personally love it so much. It has been helping me so far and I’m beyond happy I found it. It reminds me to appreciate and celebrate the small changes I’m making. It also cheers me up which I love and it’s rare for apps to do that. I recommend this app, it’s like you have friend that’s always supporting you and pushing you to do better.,I signed up for the trial and realized it was not useful to me so I cancelled on day 2 or 3.  They still charged me.  I emailed them and get an auto reply telling me how to cancel and to reply to the email if o need more help. I reply to the email and get the same auto reply over and over.  I emailed their help address - and get the auto reply.  I tried filling out the form and got a message saying they don’t do refunds at all. My account no longer exists - I tried logging in and a password reset to contact them that way  but o have no account AND THEY STILL CHARGED ME.  Complete rip-off.,This program is like venturing into the world of the self. Not only are the practices amazing and helpful, but they present it in a way that’s EXCITING to implement . Complete with a wonderful story told through  powerful poetry. I cannot wait to open the app each day and further add more of their practices to improve my daily life. It’s marked progress I can see and feel and I love it.,I like this app. It brings fun to making your life better. The stories are interesting and you can add different habits at your own pace. I’ve seen nothing like it and I’m just a starter so I\\'m learning as I go. Keep up the good work and let’s make developing positive habits a fun endeavor. Something you guys have done so thanks!,I’ve been trying to nail down a morning routine for years now and always start one but 2-3 days later, I stop. I fall back into old habits pretty quickly. With this app taking things one step at a time and not everything at once, I am finding it’s easier to stick to! Definitely recommend for anyone needing that balance in their life!,If you have trouble remaining consistent even when you can\\'t see results right away, this app is for you. This app makes having a routine more organized, simpler, and definitely more fun. A routine should not be something that you dread every day but something that gets you ahead and gives you peace for the rest of the day,I’ve been using the app for a week, and tomorrow I’ll be required to pay for the premium access that I’ve been receiving free for 7 days. From what I saw initially, the app is worth it, but after the second day, the notifications stopped pushing to my phone and there has been bugs that just doesn’t live up to my high hopes. I’m nervous about spending money on an app that will leave me with much to be desired despite its potential.,For my New Years Resolution, I wanted to start good habits and get rid of bad ones. I wasn’t sure where to start but this app has helped me with my beginning steps. Little by little I’ve been taking small actions to help me feel more productive in my day to day life. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for the same thing!,So I just started Fabulous about a week ago. I can say that it’s alright. I still have to play with it to figure things out. I do wish that there were “alarms” as reminders and a “snooze” so that if you are, let’s say running behind, you can have the reminders to remind you of your goal(s) that you need to accomplish. Again, I just downloaded it so I still have to play with the app. But so far, I think it’s great.,I’ve always had a hard time identifying and setting goals for myself. This app has gentle reminders abs doesn’t make you feel bad on sometimes a bumpy road to success. Lovely graphics and encouraging words have also been helpful for me as a visual learner. I only have it 4 stars because it is a little hard to negotiate as there is a lot here abs I feel like I need more guidance with more frequent  pop ups to guide me.,I downloaded this, and although it let me choose in theory what I was interested in, the first goal it chose for me was drinking 8 glasses of water a day. This arbitrary amount has been repeatedly debunked by doctors and is actually *not* good for some people. When I tried to get rid of that as a goal, it kept jumping to screens that talked about the importance of water (so much for choosing your own goals), then it went to a screen that showed a mountain with a pre-set path as if this were a game aimed at 10 year olds. Too frustrating to deal with; I quickly deleted.,I have tried multiple apps and multiple ways to begin a new practice or to begin again.  This far this app is helpful in a way that I don’t get ahead of myself in trying to implement too many things at once, only to fail.  \\nI have found it to be precisely what I need for where I am at in my life.  Slow and steady.,This app is great in regards to providing useful reading material, tracking habits, exploring philosophy, and trying new things. I would have no complaints except for the fact the female voice used for everything is awful. It is extremely aggravating to try and meditate while listening to someone pronouncing her T’s like she’s auditioning for an ASMR channel. Please provide more voice options, ideally someone who will speak normally.,The dynamic storytelling makes it feel like a game that I\\'m the main character in, it\\'s a nice incentive to keep going as opposed to less guidance and making me work everything out at once. I like the slow and steady wins the race. I love all the daily story videos and guidance. I think this is the best app I\\'ve downloaded and I\\'m only on day 3. I\\'ll update my review as time passes!,Want an app that helps you to pay attention to the little details in life that make a big difference in how you experience your day? This app does that. The features focus on areas that you would not think to consider like thought-provoking coaching segments and writing reflections for various activities. It’s a wonderful way to learn self-care.,Seriously this app is incredible. I am just scratching the surface and feel powerful just after the fourth day of using it. I was struggling with anxiety and this has brought me calmness and purpose. I love the daily coaching as it gets me to ponder life’s nuances before I start my day. Before this app, I would ponder my stresses instead!\\n\\nDownload this app if you need some clarity...you won’t regret it!,I truly enjoy this app. Even when I forget to use it. I go back to it. The Daily Coaching feature is my favorite. It’s a couple of words that allows a broader perspective on a variety of goals. Put in effort to achieve your goals and let Fabulous help you when it gets tough. It’s a place of reflection and kindness. I love it <3 Thanks to the creator(s) for dedicating a program.,So far I have just been using what is available for free, but based on the experience so far I do plan on purchasing the premium. It has been so helpful, has so many tools available to build successful habits, and has great graphics! You even go through a story along the way of building your habits so it is entertaining to start something new.,This app has helped me tremendously! 2020 had me in such a funk and I never in a million years could have imagined that an app would help me out of said funk, but IT DID! Instead of getting overwhelmed by the million changes I needed to make, Fabulous helped remind me that change is gradual. One thing at a time. I highly recommend the premium version of this app. Although the free one is good too!,I found this app while I was looking for something to help with stress and anxiety. It allows you to customize goals and breaks them apart into very small steps. There are infographics, daily reminders and encouragement, a storyline for your journey, anecdotes around the psychology of it all. It’s really helping me to slow down and center. I’m motivated to see through on my goals.,Great app when it works. It often logs me out and I need to log in to get the premium features back. I couldn’t restore my purchase of the subscription. The app wouldn’t let me log in using my email address so I had to delete the app in order to finally log in and restore to premium. Now it’s saying it could take 10 min to restore my progress. Disappointing. If they used in-app purchases properly this wouldn’t be an issue.,In my first day I was already loving the features of the app. So much is covered from the beginning of your day to the end of it. And there\\'s a bunch of options for new habits and scheduling, along with deep thought provoking lessons and stories. Personally, it keeps me mindful of my time and consistent with new habits. I\\'m so glad I found this app, and I\\'m definitely recommending it. ♥️,Update: Yesterday my Fab app stopped launching my daily routines, just the list of habits show up and not the individual habit screens. It’s quite frustrating!! Please fix this...\\n\\nSo far so good. I like the daily prompts though sometimes it’s confusing to know where to tap/go and what to do. But I like that it forces me to reflect and practice good habits.\\n\\nI really miss the launching of my daily routines!! I’ve already re-downloaded, reset, and started my journeys all over again to no avail—what gives?,Another \"self-care\" app that starts you off with a short free trial and quietly charges you a huge expensive annual membership fee before you even remember you installed it. \\n\\nIt’s 2021. We know that financial hardship is one of the biggest factors that can possibly go into your mental and physical health. Doesn’t matter how good the app may be, it probably does more harm than good for most people who install it because of this predatory sales tactic.\\n\\nIf they really cared about the well-being of their customers, they wouldn’t do this. So that probably hints to the quality of whatever help it purports to provide.,The fabulous keeps me on track of taking care of me! I wanted to focus on a becoming a better person starting with taking care of myself both mind and body. I started with a free week trial and absolutely loved it!! From drinking water to exercise, setting goals and meditation.  This app keeps makes it easy to stay on track and I feel fabulous!!,This app was created and built by very creative people who care. I’m loving it so far. The amount of resources and tools you can use to change your life seem endless. I’d love them to work on the “Circles” section a little more, so that it seemed more tangible to create a circle of social media friends, but it’s still great nonetheless. Much lo to you Fabulous!💖,It is so cute how this app tracks your achievements and rewards you for achieving a goal. :3 I grew up in a household where achievements were always overlooked and the mentality of my family members were always more focused on the negatives. This app makes you feel so magical and awesome for sticking to a routine. I highly recommend downloading this app. You are going to feel FABULOUS! :D,So far so good - after adding 3 kids between ages 9-14 to our household suddenly, I searched for a tool to help me keep stress low & keep myself on track for my own goals & our family. The gentle reminders & timed moments of calm Fabulous provides allows me to let go for a bit, & still feel confident that I’m not forgetting about anything important.,I’m just doing the trial to check it out. And so far I have actually been following through with the goals and I love that they are so little and I have felt the whole I feel proud of myself for actually doing it so many days in a row even if it’s just a little bit. I am seriously considering purchasing the lifetime.,I used this app in the past and even though I enjoyed it, it had felt overwhelming. I gave it another try after a while and it’s gotten so much better. I’m not feeling overwhelmed, and enjoying every minute of it. It truly helps if you are willing to take the steps. Very soothing, the design and animations are absolutely gorgeous.,I’ve been using this app for a week now and with the little changes done already I’ve noticed increased energy. After working my second job I’m usually really tired as I’m on my feet all day. Yesterday after work I felt energized to get some yard work done. I would have never done that before this app.,I find other habit apps to be overwhelming. I love how this app is designed. It takes you through each habit one bite-sized step at a time. I look forward to them because each day has a new quote or bit of encouragement until you’ve made consistent progress and are ready for the next step. It is very well thought out!,I\\'ve used this app on and off for over a year and find myself coming back to it to re-commit to the habits that make me feel good after life has thrown me a curve ball.\\n\\nCan be a bit confusing at first but with any good tool it takes a while to master it and once you get that down it\\'s an incredibly flexible instrument,I suffer from not holding myself accountable and sticking to a routine no matter how hard I try. But this app has really helped me prioritize my goals and tasks. I was never one to meditate or do yoga, but their meditation exercises are actually really neat, and they make me feel good after going through them. Definitely worth a try if you’d like some consistency in your day-to-day.,Love this app. It’s so helpful when it comes to motivation, support and all around positivity. The goals are reasonable, because YOU choose them yourself; and if you mess up? You’re supported and given a reason to start again. I love this app. It’s like a little life coach you can go to at any point to get great advice and fresh perspective to start a positive journey for your life.,I’m just starting this app so I’m not an expert however it has been giving me the hope I need to get out of bed and to keep going and to keep working on getting my routine and mental health back in place. I recommend this if you have been struggling and you just don’t know what is going to put you back on track!,I downloaded this app about a week ago, and I’m really loving it!! I love that the app does kind of a step by step with you, for me personally it really helps since I have a hard time doing things by myself. \\n\\nI also always look forward to the story that comes along with your “challenge journey” it’s such a unique addition that I turned out loving! \\n\\nAnd I really appreciate that it has you start with little steps and start to progress after a little while instead of coming all at you at once!\\n\\nDefinitely recommend and if you’re wanting to work on yourself or just need a place to get started this is the app for you!,This app is not only practical and helpful, it’s actually super entertaining. It makes what was once a daunting task for me feel like I’m living my best life by tracking my progress though this game-like interface. And the ambiance with the music?! 10/10 highly recommend this app to all my friends and their friends (it helps hold accountability!!),The app is great it’s so helpful in developing healthy habits and a daily routine.   I’ve been using it for a month and it keeps me accountable minus the guilty feeling though.  \\n\\nThe one thing that stops me from giving it a Five stars is that when I try to share the free passes I have earned, it requires pay information from my family and friends.  That part turns them off and makes them not want to try it. \\n\\nIt’s totally understandable why someone doesn’t want to share their credit card information right away.   I feel like there should be a way to bypass this option.  It would definitely give others an opportunity to see the value of this app.  \\n\\nOther than that, I love it.,I love this app so much\\nEspecially the 7 minute work out\\nI am a pre teen and I used to live in Nigeria \\nI was really skinny back then and when we move to America, after a year I started to gain a lot of weight. I am fine with my body it is just that my stomach gotta a little big. Fabulous has helped me a lot. Because the workout mostly focuses on your stomach.,I’m enjoying this app so far as it really is like an adult video game for self care and growth. I like how it progresses in turtle 🐢 steps so the habits you are forming are so gradual it doesn’t feel like effort. The only thing I’m not keen on is all the alerts it dings to get you to pick up your phone. Other than that, a delightful and fun way to develop new and shiny habits! 🌟,I am actually motivated to complete these! What is this sorcery? I am embarrassed to tell how many apps I have tried and never given them a second look! In fact, I am going to clean out my motivational/habit forming/routine starting app graveyard right now! I will update with progress, but I am REALLY feeling optimistic about this one!\\n5 days in, perfect streak. Loving this!,I’ve only been using this for 8 days but I see very large potential in this app compared to other self help apps. This doesn’t rush you, and won’t allow you to rush yourself and get burnt out. It’s all about slow change which is how real personal change happens. \\nIt’s realistic expectations which I enjoy,This is great app and at a great price it’s like a real coach is literally at the palm holding you and guiding you. You don’t have time? The app is a benefit saving you time and money! It’s a bit confusing since there is so much to do in this app but rest assured, the coach guides you through very step and tells you which ones to take. It also is based on what you want or your needs are. I challenge you to open this app and start your journey like I did!,I love that the app will only allow you to be on one journey at a time so you won’t be overwhelmed by building 80 habits at once. I’ve used it for a few weeks and have been able to make water in the morning a habit already. It’s also helped me remember to journal, take my meds, and pause to breathe. I’m a premium member and absolutely love it.,I didn’t know what to make of this App when I first downloaded it, for it was a gamble and I felt lost. In reality, I downloaded it just out of curiosity. \\n\\nThus far, it has really acted as an auxiliary in my life; one in which I have come to enjoy revisiting daily to receive a Mental and Spiritual boost of positivity. I’d highly recommend this program.,NYC fellow here. 28 . This truly helped me find a purpose to help myself and my goals to push everyday even after my father just died of Covid in January. This isn’t like other apps where they make you do unreasonable tasks in one day. It gradually helps you and makes you feel good about yourself for the small steps. Love ur worth the $30 for a year,At first the steps seem almost too simple to make a difference. But most of the time that’s exactly what you need. This app is great at making the big goals small and achievable while still keeping the end in mind. There are plenty of goals/actions to choose from and a story to go along with them.,I don’t know why, but I used to think ignorance was bliss when it came to my unhealthy habits. I didn’t wanna dive into healthier options because I was scared. I didn’t think I was good enough to keep up with a routine. This app has made it so easy for me. It addresses the concerns that run through my head. And just all-around makes me feel better.,I really like the program, and think that I can make it work.  I love the idea of staging for my habits so there are no interruptions or chances to slip.\\n\\nBut I do get confused.  Today I am asked to complete my Golden Truangle.  Unfortunately, I can’t remember exactly what that is.  Where can I look to find out?\\n\\nI do still like the music!  Thank you for playing it!,I never get notifications even though it is on, or if I do there is no noise, just a notification on my lock screen that it happened hours before. It says it’s a few bucks a month, but will charge you for the entire year before you really get an understanding or feel for the app. I honestly forgot I had it until I saw my bank account. I never use it, and I got it to help set a schedule. With no notifications it’s a pretty pointless app. Great ideas, but I forget it’s there. It’s just as helpful as the lists you never cross out.,This app is great, it’s actually helping me reset good habits I used to practice and to be more mindful of self care. I’m giving it 4 stars because the UI is a little confusing. It’s not super clear where I’m supposed to be navigating at any given time and I sometimes have trouble figuring out where to look for what I’ve done. I wish there was a clearer design, but the work itself is creating improvement in my life so yay.,This app is fantastic! I’ve been looking for an app to help me get my life together, and this app definitely helps. It provides a foundation for positive change through small habits, that individually aren\\'t very hard but when compounded provide a platform for a more productive, more active and all around more fulfilling day.,I love this app! It’s conceptually beautiful and enjoyable to use. \\n\\nFour stars only because the app clearly needs more neuro diverse thinkers, start by getting a Dark Mode going and focus on becoming a goal tracking app that’s actually trauma-informed and built for people like me, who live with and manage their disabilities with their phones. \\n\\nHappy to expand on this feedback, if Fabulous wants to hire some neuro diverse thinkers!,I’ve downloaded all major habit changing apps and this one, by far, has the best UI and navigation to help you change those habits. The quirky side? It leans towards being an RPG style app, and there’s animations you can’t skip when you’re just trying to move on and get through your routine or day. A celebration animation or a continuation of “your story” after checking off a daily habit is not something everyone will have a taste for.,I was skeptical about this app at first, but after about three days I began to notice an overall positive change in my outlook on life. I have tried tons of self-help routines and goal settings, but none have worked as much as Fabulous! I will definitely keep using this app and can’t wait to see what new changes lie ahead!,The app has a very beautiful design, and it does a great job of keeping you engaged. I really want to like this app, but I feel it takes up more of my time than it should. I tried logging one of my baby steps while getting ready for the day, and I had to tap through about five messages to get it put in. This is especially problematic as an app that’s supposed to motivate me to reduce phone usage.,I have been using fabulous for roughly a week now. It has so much to offer for you! I haven’t gotten the full version due to me not having enough money for it. But the app is so well made for just the demo I would most definitely recommend it to my friends and family. It has so many good ideas and whatnot.,This app has a lot of great self improvement ideas to help you create habits to be a better person. Only thing is I feel like there’s too much going on and there’s so many challenges that pop up. Would be good if there was some more structure or set up so there’s a clearer path than all these great things I want to click on and do. Otherwise it’s a really good quality app!,Which would be awesome. Dan is truly an amazing man doing so much good on this Earth. It\\'s a pleasant surprise to see someone else\\'s signature on the welcoming letter. To change the world for a better place, change the people for a better self. Center for Advanced Hindsight is doing God\\'s work out here. Much, much respect for these bunch of awesome people.,I have been doing the water and meditation routine in the morning and I feel a big difference of accomplishment in the morning just for those two little things makes the rest of the day to go smooth and happy, I am probably going to upgrade to the paying version so I can unlock more routines.,I’ve only had this app a short time, but I’ve been more consistent in meeting my goals in this past week than I have been in the years of attempts before finding this app. I’m proud of myself! I recommend this app if you truly want change but suffer from the willpower to achieve it.,There’s currently a glitch that has taken away the daily and nightly coaching. And the ones that do play are recent ones that are being reused too soon. Otherwise, it’s great and has helped me make some needed changes. I took away one star because the glitch issue has been going on for a couple of weeks. I deleted, redownloaded, and it’s still not working.,As it suggests this app is very thoughtfully made to help one be interested and entertained as they strive to make new habits. I highly recommend once you learn all the features which really only takes a bit of time that first day, you can enjoy various different aspects of the app that strives to motivate, encourage and inspire in the journey of building good habits.,I’ve been looking for a habit tracker or some sort of app that will hold me accountable for achieving my goals.  Fabulous has exceeded my expectations.  It not only keeps me on track with my goals but, provides me support, advice, guidance, motivation and community.   I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to better their lives!,App and phone are on most recent versions. I can’t read most of the articles. They have a header but the content is blank (eg “Exercises you can do in the morning”)\\n\\nI’m on the paid version and it seems like every time I tap on something the app’s asking me to recommend it to a friend. The app is pretty but it’s only bordering on useful so take the hint when I don’t recommend it to someone else the first 10 times.,This app has helped me so much with being consistent, setting small goals and accomplishing them so that I can work towards larger goals. It’s also taught me a lot about how meaningful small “wins” are and that it’s important to celebrate them along with the big wins. I’ve already told all my friends about it! Definitely worth the $3 monthly fee.,This app has helped me with my goals I would definitely recommend it and if it asks you to pay you can use the app without paying just don’t do the upgrade. One thing I don’t like is that you can only do 3 routines if you don’t pay. And the pay amount is a lot. But other than that this app is awesome! I love it and you should all get this!,I started using this app at a terrible time for starting new things—right before my daughter gave birth, but even in the sleepless chaos I found I could mostly keep up and now that I’m returning to my usual routines, I find the structure comforting and inspiring. I really believe I can make a difference in my life using this app.,I started with the free trial of this app, not really intending to do much with it. I’m so glad I did it because I ended up getting the year subscription! This app has helped motivate me to be better and healthier. I struggle with BPD and severe anxiety, some days getting out of bed is really hard. Somehow, someway I push through, but usually it’s with the help of this :),I am only a few days in but I love this app. It’s hard to explain. You should just try it if you are feeling stuck in any areas of your life or want to effect some changes but are unsure how.\\n\\nIt all starts with the little things!\\n\\n“Make it tiny. Make it so easy that it feels undeniably possible” - The Fabulous App,This app is so great. I’ve been more motivated instantly to work towards my goals. The story maps, meditation sounds, practical reminders, customization options, and daily coaching give me everything I need in one spot! It’s effortless to use and isn’t an app that gets in the way but serves its purpose and drives action! Highly recommend!!,I really love this app, in just one day I already feel more structured, confident, and healthier! But i do not like where it limits you unless you get premium. If this app is trying to help you with your habits and lifestyle it should consider getting rid of the premium, because you should not have to pay to get a better lifestyle! But I love this app and that’s the only con so I say 4/5!❤️✨,i love and appreciate this app because it has helped me so much over the last month, and it has impacted my life in the most amazing way possible. i love how you can customize your goals and make them personal to your needs. i also love how you can set reminders of when to do your goal and it will tell you it’s time to do it. i also love the calming music that it plays whenever you complete the goal. everyone needs this app because it can help your life tremendously. it doesn’t even matter if you are struggling in life or not, it will seriously help you so much, i 100% recommend this app, and i stand by it.,Working thru week 1.  Good reading.  Practical approaches.  App is still a work in progress.  Some very nice elements.  Visually appealing.  It allowed me (quite by my accident) to jump ahead a day.  It needs to lock down an individual day with all of the elements and not allow the day to advance until the following day.  But, if you’re paying closer attention (as I am now), you can stay on track.,This app has really helped me be more positive and confident in myself.  In completing tasks and doing things that benefit myself I often feel less stress and anxiety. Instead I’m finding myself being more positive, relaxed, and grateful. This app has helped me Orginize my thoughts and brought me peace of mind.  Would highly recommend it.  Entirely worth it!,This app was awesome. I have ADD and so far it is was helping me overcome a lot of challenges. Unfortunately the app has started not working properly. First I was charged for two supscriptions. I messaged support and it took over a week for them to respond. The response was garbage, like they did not even read it. The second issue was that the daily coaching just stopped. They said there was an issue for some devices and it was being worked on. They gave me some directions on what to do and that did not correct the issue.,...it sorta just became annoying. I started to dread the sounds of the uniquely incessantly happy tone in the morning, the cheesily overly-optimistic feel of the stories, and the game-like, journey-esque framing of the fabulous worldview on life that just felt fake to me. Couldn\\'t get into it. Maybe it\\'s based on a soft-sci psychology, maybe it just isn\\'t my sauce. If it works for you, great. But if you\\'re a bit of a glass is both half full and half empty at the same time kinda guy like me, you might want something different.,No matter what we all have habits. Some are good and some are bad. However this app help you establish good habits which eventually will erase in overwrite bad habits. It helps you get a start on your day and in your day on a good note. You can’t help but manifest and attract abundance when you’re starting and ending your day and a fabulous way!,Loving this. Never thought I’d be motivated but I am. Even though I did not upgrade and do not pay for a subscription, this app is not annoying like other ones where they make you watch an ad every second. Also there is so much to benefit from it without paying a dime.,I’m really enjoying this app. It’s helping me set and accomplish goals. It help keeps me focused on the work, rather than the problems, if that makes sense. It’s very positive. It’s been a little confusing for me to know what I’m “supposed” to do, and I docked a star for that. I’m feeling more confident as time goes on, and I’ve found detailed info about what’s all there, anyway. I’m glad I bought it.,I was looking for an app that would help me accomplish my personal goals and found this app which is totally different but it\\'s still worth it!\\n\\nThe only negative that I have is that they don\\'t offer a monthly subscription, you have to get the yearly subscription but again it seems worth it.,I have only had this app on my phone for a week, but I have completed my routine 4 days this week already and I feel so much better about myself! I love this app because of all of the positive reinforcement and encouragement and the fun infographics. The messages are sometimes a little hokey, but it’s also fun!,This app has really high quality content and beautiful sounds that are captivating. So many apps similar to this end up being a nuisance and quite annoying. I find that I always feel more mindful, especially after listening to some of their guided audio’s. \\n\\nReally great app.,I love the motivation, the reminders, the stories, the future self letters. I’ve been taking much better care of myself in just the week that I’ve had the app. For those who like to check mark off their to do list and are interested in better habits, I highly recommend this app!,Love this app. Its a mix of setting yourself reminders, in the most kind and inspiring way, self care and inspiration for goal setting. All in all with beautiful music, storytelling and keeping track tools. I am using the free version and it has plenty to offer. Remind me a little of the epic video game Journey. Thank you app - creators for this amazing App.,I was skeptical of another habit tracking app, but Fabulous is the one that finally works for me because it\\'s not just a tracking tool will some push notifications, it *coaches* me! Also it gently reminds me not to take on too many new things at once (I definitely have a tendency to).,This is the app if you want to keep track and maintain a healthy life. I have always struggled with different apps to maintain a healthy lifestyle but this app was the best out of all of them! It always has me getting to new habits that I usually wouldn’t do also reminds you to keep track of your stuff with the notifications. Overall GREATEST APP,I’ve always had a hard time trying to get new habits to form, I’ve only been using this app for less than a week and the first start off for me was to drink water every morning when I wake up and now I do it without thinking about it.I definitely recommend and love this app,I never write reviews. Partly because I find that people only write 1 or 5 star reviews but also because I’m a developer myself.\\n\\nI am only writing this to hopefully reach the Fabulous team. I was really excited about joining Fabulous and the intro to the app was really great. However, the amount of pop ups, auto playing new videos, notifications, all of it, is incredibly overwhelming. This could have been a really great app that could help people but instead you choose to harass the user with so many unintuitive menus and new things to scroll away from.\\n\\nI just wanted to check off that I drank water today, not go on a 5 minute journey in the app.\\n\\nPlease have less clutter and more things that make your app great. For now I will not be continuing my subscription and will be looking elsewhere for a similar product.,This is an amazing app for self improvement!! It keeps you on track while providing positive feedback and momentums to help you up through your struggles. It helps you one habit at a time and gives you outlets to succeed on the app such as: positive quotes, workouts and stuff like that. I’m very impressed and will continue using this app.,It was a good app until I got overwhelmed and stopped using it... I forgot I was even subsribed to the premium until I got charged for it. Being a student who makes minimum wage and has a lot of other expenses, I can\\'t exactly afford to be spending so much money on an app I don’t even use, but I have been trying to reach out for help getting a refund for over a week now and I haven’t heard a thing back. I had canceled my subscription and still got charged, and it has been a nightmare trying to get assistance with this issue.,I love the app and use it daily without fail. It has helped me tremendously but recently the Launch routine button has disappeared and this has greatly diminished my, and i suspect others, user experience. I’ve contacted support and received no response. This is a great feature which increases engagement substantially and is very much missed.... to the point I would like a refund if it isn’t restored.  Please help return this function and I will change my review. Thank you, Marcus,I have tried several other apps and end up getting bored. This app has kept me interested and motivated when others have not. It makes me stop throughout my day to think if what I’m doing is ultimately leading to completing desired goals.  Yet, it does it without making me feel guilty.,I have been struggling to get my life together for awhile and im also trying to loose weight. This app has helped me with both of those things. If ur struggling to be productive, or just want to get you life back together, use this app!! There is still plenty of stuff without premium, so don’t worry about that.,This app is pretty helpful in changing habits or sticking to your goals. It suggests to start slowly to get used to a routine and celebrate the success. You can also add habits to your morning, afternoon and evening routine, check them off and track your progress. There are also a lot of motivating images and animations.,I’m using this app and it really good for keeping track for your routines but just one problem it keeps closing out of the app when I was choosing my afternoon routines just want to let you know I do recommend getting this app if you can but apart from that problem 9.5/10,This app so far is great. It has a wonderful and easy UI that is easy to follow and understand. I think the only drawback is maybe that there’s SO much in the app, it can be overwhelming or difficult to figure out where to start. I’m intrigued and can’t wait to discover all the features of this app,This app is amazing! I’ve tried to use other apps to help me build habits but get overwhelmed from trying to do too much. Fabulous nudges you in the right direction so you don’t overwhelm yourself. It helps you head on the right path and makes you feel like you are on an adventure of life!,Someone send you a so called free seven day trial. They send you an email after the seven day trial same before you go do XYZ see you think you are of dissolved have any responsibilities and then Bam they bill you at the last minute. Go online and look at everything they scam people hard-core. And there’s no way to report them through the Apple store because they make you sign up through their website it doesn’t go through the Apple store there’s no way to report them. Scammers scammers scammers do not sign up,This app has keep me to do these things to take care of myself most of the time I could less if I eat or drinker or sleep this app keep me from all the bad and focused on my self which is what I really needed at the time I have not found myself completely but this app helps me do so step by step day by day,I’ve only had this app for a week but so far it’s been amazing. Lot of information but they give it to you in small bits so you’re not overwhelmed. Same goes with goals. They start you off slow and allow you to have control over what you want to tackle first and next.,This app didn’t work for me. I was hopeful.. but it’s too silly.. and although I was invited to a 30 day free trial.. I was charged to yearly subscription after only 7 days? I didn’t even use it for more than 3 days.  It was a waste of time. It wouldn’t let you skip ahead.. w/ out telling you how unsuccessful you’d be if you did so. Seriously.. I have to wait for 3days and of waking up\\n  drinking a full glass of water first thing each morning? Are you serious? I didn’t use it and thought I had 30 days to cancel.  Waste of time and $$!,This app is truly amazing...Honestly I’ve only had the app for about 2 weeks now, and I haven’t even gotten to everything Fabulous has to offer! I’m very excited have this app to help me change my life after letting Depression control it for so long... I wish you all a beautiful and wonderful journey ❤️,I love this app and it’s actually incredible. Exceeded my initial expectations but the app could be more intuitively designed. I find myself being like “oh wait where’s that one coaching recording?” \\n\\nALSO.. you can only sign in on one device... if you download onto youriphine and then iPad like I did, there’s no option to login... only an option to create an account,Being unable to add habits that aren’t every day is extremely frustrating. I do an intense exercise routine three days a week and the app will mark it as incomplete if I don’t do it every day. Therefore, my streaks are never longer than a day and it looks like I’m failing when I’m not. Other examples include wanting to add a medication schedule that is not supposed to be daily or a do work schedule during the weekdays and not on the weekends. The app has a very beautiful design and I want to keep using it, but it’s so frustrating.,To any future users, know that their are some things you could pay for to enhance your experience, but it’s not necessary. This greatly helped me achieve my goals at my pace and it got me started to continue doing things I always knew I should. Really all it takes is starting.,I was loving the app until I saw that we have to pay about 30$ just to get our mental and physical health back on track.. and I have no problem with that as I am an adult but I know some of my nieces and nephews who’ve been struggling with their mental health, and what about them or any other kids who want to use this app and can’t afford to pay that much.,This is the best app I’ve ever downloaded . It is helping me change my life in so many positive ways. My outlook since downloading it has changed so much, I even look forward to waking up in the morning more. A must have for anyone who struggles with depression, anxiety or organization issues like me.,I would like to cancel my membership as of 3:00 pm Mountain Time on February 6, 2021. According to what was indicated when I signed up I was suppose to be able to cancel if I went into setting before 1 weeks time. I have searched and searched settings and can\\'t find any specific area that will let me cancel the program. AGAIN, CANCEL. MY MEMBERSHIP AS OF TODAY. \\n\\nI found that a lot of what the program wanted me to do I was already doing. Due to that, I do not need to pay for the program when I\\'m already doing what it is recommending. \\n\\nValene Archibald.,I absolutely love this app and it’s self care ways that help you improve through positive reinforcement and motivation! Best part is is that YOU are in control of everything that happens and it’s up to you to really push and make that change. Thank you fabulous for this amazing opportunity to try and reclaim my life!❤️☺️,I would call this a self help app, because I never felt like I was alone. The guided step by step immersion in understanding your day to day and how those help you work towards goals is amazing. I’m usually not great at these things because I don’t celebrate the little wind, but the app reminds you to be proud of the small moments.,I’m barely a couple days in but it seems promising. The layout is a little difficult to navigate but outside of that it is really good for someone who is trying to change their habits. That’s really what the app is about. It’s habit building. I wish it were also a little more in my face about reminders. But other than that. It’s good for the price,Little confusing to navigate - but from what I can tell - it’s pretty awesome\\nSo far. Just took an extra min to figure out all the functions and directions. But it’s very good and I have already changed a few morning habits I never thought I would be able to do! So success!!,Nothing better than scientific based help. I’ve been using this to push myself and accomplish things ive been stuck on. Some of us are great coaches but struggle with self motivation- if you’re like me this app is great and definitely recommend the little extra for annual subscription,I don’t rate apps but I want this one to continue succeeding. It is such high quality from the design to the storytelling to the daily coaching. It really does feel like they believe in us and they’re doing everything they can to help. I’m excited about using this for some time.,I recently had to get a new phone after losing my old one and love the fabulous app. However once I redownloaded the app on this newer phone the only tabs on the bottom are home, journey, and discover. This is super duper disappointing since I used the fabulous moments timers to help me do homework and exercise and now they aren’t there anymore. I wouldn’t have paid for the year of I had known that :(,What I like about Fabulous, is the balance between choices. Trying some thing for three days to assess whether it works for me or not, feels like small goals I can keep. This keeps me motivated. The story format is inspirational, and keeps me connected to what’s important. I like starting and ending my day with Fabulous.,I just got this app, but already I feel supported in a way that makes me feel that I can achieve the goals I have for myself and build and maintain daily habits that will benefit my life. It appears to use some CBT and DBT approaches. So it’s almost like therapy for me in a way. 10/10 would recommend.,I gave the app a try with the goal to feel more energized, I was given the promise that I only need 15 days to get there and they kept their word.\\nI’d say give it a shot and see for your self what good it could bring you!\\nps: Words of appreciation to the fabulous team behind the scenes. Mohammed.,I needed a push, to get me started. I always jump to the biggest goal first, however this app has taught me to enjoy the little journeys to greater success. Now the mountain of self discipline doesn’t look so hard to climb. Just one step at a time. One moment of gratitude after the next!,I have been using this app for the last 3 weeks and I really love the Daily Coaching Audio Clips. The 2 to 3 mins audio clips are very insightful and put things in perspective. However these daily coaching clips went missing for the last few days. Contacted the support group. Hopefully they can fix the problem to continue benefiting from this app.,Has been great so far in providing great tools and environment for me to develop better habits. The interface takes some getting used to, but I love the mood that the app sets with its visuals and music. Tracking is simple and it encourages you to take everything gradually and enjoyably. So far so good!,I’ve tried a lot of different wellness apps and this is one of the best that I’ve ever seen. It has a lot of different ways to participate and I’ve found it’s very easy to be involved, consistent, held accountable, and be connected to a community. I can already tell that it’s making a difference.,Solid science behind this app. It’s great for retraining your brain towards compassion and positivity. Love how you can tailor your approach. Not intrusive or a drain on my time to do the check-ins. It’s already made me get up an hour earlier the last two days I’ve used it and feel more motivated and grounded throughout the day.,I was excited to try this app but with very little info on how it works and the inability to adjust customize the habits, I cancel within the first 2 days! I filled out their survey on why I was not moving forward with the subscription and yet I was still charged for the premium service. I am waiting for my refund but do feel there is something going on there. Why have me go through a survey on canceling before the 7 days is up if you are still going to charge me?,I love that this gives you more of a “why” behind what you’re doing. There are a lot of apps that just list what you want to accomplish and you can check it off when you do it, but this app makes it a story and is compelling enough that you want to keep following along,Great app to build confidence and integrate gradual healthy change into your life. I’ve suggested this to my therapist as something to offer to clients who are depressed and need real change, but the app is  hard to figure out and navigate at first. On the first day I accidentally marked my first task as done before I’d even done it or knew what it was because there is no instruction in how the app works.,VERY helpful app. I have tried to many things and this app actually makes me want to stick with it. Its actually pretty entertaining. I will say that there are a lot of things going on so sometimes i get confused with all of the action items but maybe it is a good thing i will never get bored. Thanks!!,Absolutely amazing app. I struggle with mental health and have a very demanding job in healthcare. This helps me stay grounded and care for my patients.\\n\\nI am just wondering why the daily coaching has not been working for the last couple weeks. I no longer get an updated daily coaching. Hit or miss with the focus coaching.,I honestly am trying my hardest to really lose weight but I just never have the motivation and I usually give up on the 1st day. This app reminds me when it’s time and helps me set goals for myself, and It’s always proud of me for example: “I’m proud of you julie” “you got this” etc. and i’m just so happy i’m finally doing it,I got the paid version of this app and it is amazing! There are so many choices of journeys and challenges. I’ve been using this app to help make healthier changes in my life and it really helps to keep me accountable. I love how it reminds you throughout the day for what you need to do. This is my most favorite app ever!,I’m looking to be more disciplined in my life and I’ve always had a problem with “biting off more than I can chew” so usually I burn out pretty quick. \\nThis is helping to regulate my steps and I’m already seeing those steps build to better habits at day 5. \\nTake it slow and trust the process,Not much to say. Had this app for like a few days and it’s very therapeutic. I’m not talking to a physical person or being and I’m not really saying things out loud so I can litteraly say anything without being scared of being judged. My notes app does the same thing but this app makes u think,It is a great app to help you set up action steps! The only thing that I would suggest is that I need an alarm reminder to do these steps. There are reminder notifications but it would be great if it continued to notify you until you click on it :) it is great app and I enjoy it!,With the pandemic this year and a bad motor vehicle accident six months ago, I fell off track in many areas of my life. It felt like my well-being went out the window. I’m genuinely enjoying using this app to reestablish healthy habits and mindfulness. I’m taking small but steady steps toward transformation. Thank you for a great product!,I really wanted to like this app. The video trailer showed me exactly what I am looking for in a habit tracker. Unfortunately it doesn’t tell you that the UI is bloated and confusing. I just want to log that I drank my water, I don’t want multiple motivational messages, forced journaling, or to look at a bunch of Pinterest like images that I can’t even interact with. I shouldn’t have to swipe away multiple pages just to log water. What a complete disappointment.,This is a great and simple app to use when developing better habits. Some apps are way to complicated and add so many things that becomes overwhelming. This added contents is detrimental when you’re busy and trying to work on bettering yourself. Simple, kind and smart is better in this case. Thank you!,It’s a great app but it’ll take some time getting used too. This app is perfect for those who want to build simple habits then use them as a piggy back for more challenging habits. Also it’s a bit pricey and the interface could use a touch up, but other than that, it’s a solid app.,I love this app so far. I’ve only been using it for 3 days now but I love how the little habits you choose to make everyday can effect so much. \\nChecking off the boxes of each habit as I do them is so satisfying. \\nHighly recommend this to anyone who is looking to get back on track with their lives.,I have only been using the app since the year began. I have no complaints I’m following the foundations journey rn and just the little encouraging messages and stories I have gotten so far are so beneficial. It keeps me going. As someone who struggles with consistency it’s kept me on track and motivated and my journey has just begun!,Put together so well! I am loving how interactive it is!! I look forward to it daily and I feel like I’m seeing changes in myself already! I love the journaling aspect as I’ve been wanting to start journaling but nothing felt right until now!! So excited to see where this takes me!,During the pandemic I developed a lot of bad habits and routines. I wasn’t at all happy with myself and sort of starting to fall into a depression. After just 5 days using fabulous I’m already seeing a difference!!! I’m not even using premium. I highly recommend it. This app is helping me get my life together.,Loving it so far—you start small and it’s gamified, but the reminders help so much and I love checking it off every day.\\n\\nWill add another further down the road, as we’ll see whether it continues to apply when other bits of life interfere with habit forming actions (as is wont to happen in my life).,The quick truth Fabulous is the only app for my overall wellness I’ve ever stuck with. It’s easy, the meditation is exactly what I needed, the daily coaching helps me set my intentions and the habit tracking has been a vital tool in me getting both my mental and physical health back on track!,I’ve been using Fabulous for about a week and I’m so impressed with the interface and how immersive it is. The reminder to help set you up for success are awesome! It’s definitely motivated me to make small changes that feel attainable every day, and doesn’t make me feel crappy if I miss a day.,I haven’t been using this app for a week and a half, and I have really loved the structure that it has provided for me on my self-care journey. I would recommend this app anyone who wants to change their life with good habits and improve their productivity, energy and mindset!,I love it. It’s the only thing that I have found that really walks you through setting goals, and implementing them in small, yet effective ways. I look forward to opening the app and checking off my challenges daily. I’m just obsessed. Kudos to whoever created this.,This little app is saving my life right now. The key is to stick with it. Yes some of the graphics and posts get repetitive, but the routines and how they are presented are done in such a way as to be successful. Small steps taken each day actually do get you to where you are going. :-),So many programs give you the same ol’ same ol’ - move more, drink more water, just make time and your life will change schpiel. This app provides actionable self care - with how to make time and how to move more. I feel like I’m making progress, and highly recommend,This is app so far is definitely worth it I haven’t even paid for the full year and already it has helped me on rough days, if anyone is looking to help themselves or looking for a change or even just browsing this is great to check out,Overall, great experience. Only lost a star due to the huge number of clickable options; its overwhelming to try and understand what I’m supposed to do next and how to most effectively use all the options. Remove some of the initial features to reduce the number of people who drop off in the first few days.,This a wonderful way to build new habits.\\nMy struggle with building new habits was that I tried to implement too many new habits all at once that required big change overnight. Therefore, it was not sustainable. This app allows me to make small habits that lead to big habits and major changes in my life. \\n\\nSuper helpful!,This app is incredible. I love everything about it but there’s only one problem: I don’t get alarms or reminders! Yes, I already activated: Notification sound, alarm sound, sound effects. I also tried removing the app and install it again; none of that worked. \\nIt’s really sad because I payed the anual subscription. \\n\\nIt’s just so annoying to receive a thousand notifications from Instagram, Facebook but none of Fabulous. \\nIt’s important to me because the first thing I do in the morning is checking my phone and not being able to see a single notification from this app when I activated all of them makes me very confused and I forget the app even exists. (I tried activating the notifications on settings as well) \\n\\nIf someone knows how to fix this problem I will rate it 5*,I love love love this app! I can tell that a lot of measures have been taken to make sure that it is useful, efficient and cater to us. I truly recommend this app to everyone. I have been consistent with it and it has been consistent with me. A lot of perspective learned from this app. I have grown from utilizing it. Thank you FABULOUS ❤️,Flexible and gives small short bits of info and motivation here and there the the day, to keep you refocused but not be distracting or feeling like interruptions. great am and pm reflections. I have full premium version. Liking the connected selection of meditations and exercises, sleep casts, etc. lots of little things right in one app!,I love it so far , but I have fallen behind cause I haven’t been ready for a certain step. And that’s fine . It waits for you to commit . When you’re ready then you proceed to the next step . I think it’s great to have a focal point , a stepping stone into the right direction .,I’m not too far in to it, but so far it’s great. I enjoy all the positive things there are to explore. It really keeps me on track and motivated. I am having trouble getting them to give me my 30 day trial but in contact with customer service so hopefully that will get worked out before my 7 day expires: other than that, so far so good.,It’s helpful for the day to day, to keep you focused, and bring you back to what is important to you.\\nA large part of the way it works is the fact that you downloaded it and are seeking a better understanding of how to meet your day to day goals. This app does that and more. My favorite part is the well applied quotes found throughout.,Thank you so much for developing this magnificent app. \\nI have only just begun 3days ago. I trust Fabulous and I really look forward to my daily journey. \\nI feel so much better about my growth and everything about me and my world.  I’m changing for a more positive life and loving every minute of it❣️❣️Thanks again. D for Debi O,I am enjoying this app so far. I have just begun the journey but I feel good because I have been able to complete the tasks over the past week. I also think it’s fun how they set up the app as a journey and it’s less like a job to complete the tasks. It’s an enjoyable experience !,I’ve used a number of habit tracking apps before, but I appreciate the focus on developing sustainable routines. I also like the motivational aspects of the app. My only complaint is that it took a while to figure the app out - there are lots of different features but there never seems to be a clear overview of the app.,For a while I have been looking for a way to keep tabs of healthy new little habits to incorporate into my routine. The app does that exceptionally. It sends me reminders throughout that day to accomplish the goals I have set up for myself and it keeps me accountable. Love it! It’s got good resources too.,I’ve been searching for an app like this for years. Everything I’ve ever needed/wanted: reminders, habit settings, articles, bed time stories, meditation (only thing that’s ever taught me how to), reminders, Affirmations, I could keep going. Changed my life. Thankful is an understatement. This app is just incredible,I am LOVING Fabulous so far! As a young adult, it feels good to have something to keep my life under control. I feel motivated and rejuvenated every morning, knowing I am achieving and improving all health wellbeing’s. I am only on day #3, but it’s can’t wait to see the change in myself these next couple weeks. ❤️❤️,Was really into it until the second time it reset my “streak” - went from 60 to 30 in a day? Frustrating and unreliable unfortunately because I really wanted to like it. Tried to reach out to customer service and they responded a month later saying they were very busy responding to many inquiries- no help. And now when I try to log on it won’t allow me. Too many glitches, don’t recommend unless you want to be frustrated with something that’s supposed to help.,Starts with the smallest steps and just keeps building. The daily coaching are the perfect ways to start and end my day. I am making so many good changes and the app has become so integral to my days already. I have only had it about two weeks but I really love it.,I love how they put everything in baby steps. Making progress to be more of the person I want to be. :) they start out really simple so it is easy to have success and to stay motivated. They have relevant goals that I think most people are trying to achieve :),I really wish you had a setting for people who work graveyard. I love this whole idea but it’s hard to stick to when there’s not really a way to tailor it to my schedule. Working graveyard I find it really hard to balance my schedule and be productive especially during the week and I was hoping this could help. 3 stars for the idea and layout.,I’ve noticed many users of this app are much younger.  It brings me joy when I see young ones deciding for themselves in healthy ways.  It’s never to late nor to early to develop new, healthy habits and a healthy mindset in general.  Thank YOU FABULOUS for giving us this platform!  You are changing lives! 💜🙏🏼💜,Tiny changes in habits and formation of new habits, bit by bit—what a brilliant idea. Normally I bite off more than I can chew, which derails self-improvement efforts quickly. \\nI feel very hopeful about the incremental changes adding up to larger, meaningful life improvement.,This app has been the only thing to push me forward ever since I got it. I\\'ve always been big on motivation but around New Years I lost it and couldn\\'t seem to regain it, so this has proved itself extremely worthy. It\\'s helping me physically and mentally already.,I really like the app because it helps me change little things over a long period of time and doesn’t overwhelm me. I think the app can be confusing at first because so much information is thrown at you. Stick with it and you will see that you will make positive changes in your life.,I’ve only been using this app six days, but I’ve successfully done a little tidying in my home each morning. This action alone has greatly reduced my anxiety levels. It’s not just the cleaning, but that the app lavishes me with praise. So I actually look forward to doing it. I can certainly see how in time this will develop healthy habits.,So helpful and thorough! Content and advice is amazing. Truly helps you stay on track and set goals and meet them. I look forward to opening it every morning...feels like I have my own life coach right by my side. Not sure how I came across this app...but so glad I did. It’s truly a gift! : ),This is a great app and it helped me a lot and I would definitely want to continue but I wish that more things were free because not everyone can afford premium. As everyone is struggling through mental issues it is a serious matter which I think that it should be free for all users for their pleasure.,Reasonable amount of news-like advertising (Public Service Announcement/Self Help Messages). One a day, and they don’t pile up like your email. \\n\\nMessages are insightful and the messages within seem to be the meat of Buddhist Dharma. \\n\\nI felt a lot of pressure to sign up for too many actions after a “honeymoon period” of simple, mindfully encouraging self exploration contemplations.,It starts out slow and it makes you feel like Meh this is going to be nothing. However it really teaches you consistency and follow through without being overloaded with tasks and allows you to see how your commitment is going. Doesn’t set you up to fail. Love it,Highly reccomend everyone download fabulous... I struggle with PTSD, depression, and AUD. I have found fabulous to be extremely helpful throughout my mental health and self love journey. The free version is great, but I’ve been considering paying for it yearly. The daily pledge to no alcohol is my favorite, it has kept me from relapsing a few times.,It’s annoying that if my life gets a little too hectic to interact with the app like it wants, it starts to ask a whole bunch of questions that do not relate to the situation at all. I should be able to freely use it as I come and go. I don’t have to be on it so strictly to be making progress, and I understand that’s not everybody. But it would be amazing if it didn’t make me basically restart after I get too busy with life. It makes me want to stop using it entirely and that is unfortunate.,Everything is what you make of it. If you do not open the app and commit to at least trying, this app will not work. However, if you do follow the small simple steps it’ll take you places you didn’t think was possible!,I love how motivating this app makes me feel for my future, and sadly up till recently I never really did think of my future. I’m only 4 days in and am enjoying every second. I really do look forward to my mornings now, and I am NOT a morning person lol,I’m fairly new to this app but I’m finding it very helpful. The reminders help keep you on track and there’s a lot of positive encouragement. It’s nice that you can share it with a friend to keep each other accountable. It’s a little confusing at first, as the goals start out simple, but that’s on purpose so it doesn’t get overwhelming.,I don’t like that it’s not possible from the first day to choose all habits you want but have to do stuff like drinking water and eating breakfast that probably already are routines. But after that, I liked it and there are a lot of habits you’re able to choose and you can even change the visuals which I love,I have ADHD so I have an especially hard time with keeping routines. And add anxiety and depression to the mix, it’s not pretty. But this app has magically helped me implement routines into my day! It’s so satisfying to complete the routines, and it literally makes me look forward to getting up each morning.,Honestly this is a huge help! I am not going to lie the only reason I still have it on my phone is because I forgot to cancel the free trial but I definitely am glad that happened! It is truest very helpful for my adhd brain and helps me make and keep habits!,This app is my favorite and I use it constantly. It helps train myself into breaking old habits. I truly have felt like a new person ever since I downloaded it just because of how much it guides you into bettering yourself. I feel much healthier both mentally and physically. Thanks a lot!,I absolutely LOVE this app so far!!! I have always wanted to get up and make each day great- but I am never one to just get up and do it. I am a checklist girl. I follow a set of items on a list each day. So this works perfect for me, to remind of all that I need to do each day to be better!,I downloaded it a few days ago and the smallest changes have done wonders for my mental health. Like a few days ago was the most fulfilling day I’ve had in 6 YEARS and all the positive emotions drove me to tears you guys and this app are lifesavers ❤️❤️❤️,It’s affordable and it’s cheaper than therapy. Small steps have made it so easy to follow and not get overwhelmed. The stories, info graphics and art are beautiful and engaging. I’m eating a health breakfast and I meditated for ten minutes. It’s day 3. Anything is possible if you want to make a change.,I’m on day eight, and so far this has been really helpful. I’m stretching again rather than meaning to get to it sometime, and very much enjoying my Fabulous moments. \\n\\nAnd this is the free version. So far, the fact that I haven\\'t paid for anything has not affected the helpfulness of the app at all.,Personally I tend to continue using things that are easy and aesthetically pleasing and this app is both keeping me motivated and excited to continue building new better habits for myself from water first thing in the AM to a healthy breakfast to going to the daily gym daily,I am new to the app but so far it is one of the best apps I’ve ever used. A combination of story, delightful animation, mystery, poetry, sounds and motivational coaching makes it so appealing on many levels. It has elements of a game that makes you feel motivated to interact with the app. I think whoever designed it was brilliant!!,I need to get down morning habits to a ritual and can’t afford to mess around.  This app. Is a amazing.  What I really love about it is that I get help every step of the way and it keeps me motivated.  I highly recommend this to anyone needing to be a morning lark but is actually a night owl.  This definitely helps.,I felt that I had become lethargic and without real daily direction. I needed a little bit of hand-holding and motivation. This app addresses that need with achievable goals, motivational arcs, and a consistent fostering of a feeling of personal growth and success. Well worth the download.,Most times when I try to change behaviors I go too quickly and then I burn out. This app is great to add habits as I can and if I try to go quickly it is good to remind me that I don’t need to change everything right now. It’s really helped me make lasting change.,I like how the app uses tiny habits to help me improve myself. My critique would be them at there are too many bells and whistles to distract you which is ironic concurring they constantly tell you to take it slow with your habit building. So I move had a slight learning curve but I ultimately like the app and think you would too.,I’ve always had an issue of being consistent and accountable so I’m only in day four,Your alarms chime to tell you you’ve got things to do that you’ve told yourself that you’d be accountable for. I’m still learning the app but I love when it’s helped me with so far,This app was great and helped me establish routines. Lately though, it’s been super buggy - not showing letters and activities which is very disappointing. I tried following their directions to fix the problem but it’s done nothing. It was a fantastic app while it was working but now it’s glitchy and frustrating to use.,I stumbled across this playing a game. I have been struggling with a lot internally and externally. I like that this app is making you focus on one thing at a time while providing non-cheesy motivation coaching. After I do my morning ritual I pick up my phone and this is this first thing I do.,So far so great! I’ve tried different apps to help remind me to do things but I end up ignoring them. This one is different. I get little rewards for checking my boxes. It’s totally holistic and has kept me coming back so far. Well worth the subscription price if they can keep the content from being repetitive!,I am honestly still on my 5th day using this app but I feel more hopeful that before. I can see myself getting better and better everyday. It still takes ones will power but fabulous was is my guide. 😊,I just got a 12 pro and now my fabulous app doesn’t work. The app is pretty much blank and things don’t load. I updated the app and it didn’t fix the issue..... I pay for this app so I’m a little disappointed that this doesn’t work on my new phone. I hope they fix this issue soon.,I’ve used this app for a few weeks and I can definitely say that I have been getting better about caring for myself through breathing exercises, stretching, and journaling.  I hope it continues for me! \\n\\nIt can be too much at first, but once you change settings and learn some of the specs it’s a lot better.,This app I’d deeply powerful. Just as an avalanche can begin with a small change up on a mountain, so too can this program trigger successive waves of self-reinforcing change. Give it a try, and enjoy the immediate and continued support that the program gives you along your journey.,I’ve only started a couple days ago and I never have a morning ritual and work has been hard to focus on Bc of that. This app is making small reachable goals and a morning ritual has been a part of it and it’s so nicely structured that you don’t get overwhelmed with a lot of new habits in the course of a day.,Amazing app. Really helps motivate you to want to be a healthier happier version of yourself. I’ve found this app to be a life changer from meditation to eating healthy reminders and so much more. This app has really made a positive change in my life.,this app has made me more motivated in the past few days and helped me get exited to get everything done! I also like how much the app lets you do without paying even though I think paying would make it extra helpful,I absolutely love this app! For some reason i just feel the need to hold myself more accountable and stay on track with my healthy habits. The design definitely keeps me interested and the motivational words are so so helpful. I never leave app reviews but this app is helping me so much.,I’ve been a premium member for 2 years and loved the app so much and the last update was great until the “fabulous” screens were deleted as well as daily coaching. Instructions for breathing and meditation are gone which has ruined my progress. If this isn’t fixed ASAP I will be demanding a full refund from Apple for application fraud. \\nAs of right now I would recommend finding any another habit helping application over this one.\\nThanks for screwing over your customers! 👏👏👏👏,So I wanted to try this app for a week free.  I was charged for a year even though I cancelled the subscription before the week was up.  They won’t give me a refund and now I can’t use the app because I requested a refund.  So I’ve paid for a year that I didn’t want and now I can’t even use it if I wanted to because the app doesn’t think I’ve paid.  I’ve paid for it and I’d love my money back, but customer service has been useless.  What a rip off.,Fabulous is so wonderful. It will help you! It has helped me tremendously. The coaching is spot on and beautiful, I’m just so glad that I gave this app a chance! You will be glad too! I am just a regular person and wanted you to know how wonderful it is.,This app has truly changed my perspective and has helped me enjoy life more fully by soaking in the small moments that are mine, instead of distracting myself from unpleasant things. It has helped me be more mindful, which is tough to do with so many distractions.,I was skeptical of this app at first but after a week of using it, I realized how helpful it really is. It helps you to be mindful of your habits and how you are treating yourself. I would love to see a widget option! Otherwise, definitely worth the subscription price.,So far I really like it. If you are someone who likes reminders and gets satisfaction from checking off items on a to do list then you will like it. I cannot wait for my better habits to take over. Feeling grateful I stumbled across the app!,This is my second time around with Fabulous. I used it three years ago to transform my life, but the pandemic threw everything back off this year. I know that if I could get my life in order before, I can do it again.,Who knew behavioral economics could be so fun? While I have just started my journey, I cannot thank the Fabulous team enough. This app has really made a difference in how I structure my day, feel about my day, and ultimately choose to live my day.,It’s so food even for the free version. It keeps you motivated to keep your goals based on your personal preferences, daily reminders of you want to, forums for participants to talk about the subjects you’re interested and more. A very good app!,Only two days in and this app is already helping me so much. It makes completing goals fun and offers so much hands on guidance. I’m checking in with myself, completing goals step by step and feeling really good so far. Can’t wait to see where this journey goes ❤️🌿,Only been using for a couple weeks and I’ve missed some days but the days I use this app really help me feel positive about life and positive about myself. I love how customizable it is, and the sounds and music and voices are pretty and calming and i like how visually appealing it is.,I never review apps but this one is really good. I’ve never been so invested in a self care app, and it operates in a way that keeps you on top of things. I also never spend money on apps but this one is worth it. If you’re struggling with life I definitely recommend it.,Doesn’t matter what the app, it should let you cancel in a convenient manner and return money for the remaining time. I was on a free trial and didn\\'t get a reminder at the end of trail so it automatically renewed for a year, i thought id give it a go , but this was just not my thing at all,  and while the instructions say i can cancel anytime and get my money back, it doesn’t do that! That’s annoying. \\nSo if someone from fabulous is reviewing this, please do return my money. \\nThank you,I enjoy this app a lot. This app helps me to keep my routine in check and stay consistent. The free version is more than enough to get you started but I definitely will be purchasing the premium version because it seems to be worth it!,I wasn’t expecting this app to help me as much as it has. The KIND reminders & encouragement when I am struggling to keep on track help tremendously. No guilt when I haven’t kept up, & always science based techniques every step of the way helping me to stay motivated & hopeful!,I have always wanted to improve my life, all at once. And Fabulous has a structured path for me that I can easily follow. I have been able to change habits and keep new ones even when I forget to use the app. Life changer.,So far in the first week of this app and I love it. It has begun to inspire my wife and I to get going and build a solid foundation for steps to a healthy and happy life, even more than we have now.  Sometimes navigating gets me turned around but I am still learning the app.,I’ve really been enjoying this app so far. It actually feels like the developers and team want us to see results and to support us. It doesn’t feel like empty words or routines. Everything has a purpose, and that purpose is to help us succeed.,It’s a friendly app that is geared more towards women I’d like to see a male version or option for the character. Even maybe an animal. Other wise it slowly my gets you on your game starting with little things like drinking water and getting breakfast in you.,Fabulous is so easy to use, and relaxing. It’s like having a calm mentor guide you to success. I now have better habits in my morning routine (waking earlier, drinking water, and planning my day out calmly and with mindfulness) it was one of my best investments in self-care.,I love habits and rituals but I do way too much too quickly and always beat myself up when I fail. I am learning so much about how to frame my thoughts and actions for success. This is a great app for growing with yourself and not in spite of yourself.,I haven’t gotten far into the app, but what I’ve seen is that when they ask what you identify as the only other option other than (wo)man is non-binary. I personally as a Genderfluid person don’t know what to put. I wouldn’t say I don’t like the app just because of this, but I’d like to point it out.,Enjoying my fabulous journey thus far.\\nDue to glitches in the app I had to start my journey again, but I’m still enjoying. The app gives me a moment of peace and solitude throughout my day that I would otherwise ignore. An a improvement would be to launch certain fab moments whenever I want.,First, I have only been using this app for 2 days and I am feeling much better and I suggest to download this app. Second, this app helps you be more positive and have a more happy life. It also helps you with your feelings or troubles with yourself.,I’ve kept my new routines up for 6 days in a row now, hoping to keep it going. One thing I need to figure out is if I can move daily goals around to different times in the day. For instance, exercising; if I can’t get to it in the morning, but achieve the goal in the afternoon, can/should I still mark it as done?,I have had this app for a few days and it has motivated to be a better version of me. I aspire to be and create a path filled with health and wellness for myself and onto others. Super excited to use this app, I bought the premium for the year! ⭐️,I love this App, it has brought awareness to self care.  It sends me reminders of the the goals, I set for myself.  Like drinking water, walking, exercising, and even flossing.  I am learning to put myself first and take care of myself, instead of others.  Making,”me time” and it feels good.,A good daily motivation app to remind you to do the things that scientifically improve happiness. Generally takes less than 10 minutes a day, and helps you check in with yourself each day.,My mental health, I feel, is fairly good at the moment. However, I feel incredibly lazy all the time and so I decided to try this app. So far, it has been amazing! I’m excited to see my progress by the end of this month! (Maybe I’ll even update this 👍),The user interface is really complicated with lots of things to explore on the dashboard. I really wish it was less complicated and had these on the side. It’s also really way too pricey at $30 a month.

This is a pretty, well thought out app that I will actually pay real money for.,This is an app that makes me feel motivated to use it and change myself. The only thing is the subscription.

I have never been able to actually stick with something as long as I have this time. And it’s all thanks to fabulous!,Joined the month free of premium to see if Fabulous was for me. I thought it had a lot of extra fluff I wouldn’t use, no clear place to see my achievements, and it flows poorly. I tried to cancel twice (and thought I was just they were letting me finish my free trial), but they charged me. Apparently cancelling is a four step process so you will be roped into a paying for the year, so I missed the cutoff.

Having Fabulous to keep track of my progress and encourage me along the way has been the needed extra push to help me be more consistent with my habits.,I just started using this app less than a week ago.

What we can control however are our thoughts, habits, and attitude. This app continually reminds me to be forward focused on living a more fabulous life.,This is a very comprehensive app that is like having a digital life coach. It’s very interactive. I do have some request: ability to choose a different voice in terms of representation. There are no voices of people of color. It’s obvious that this is a scientifically reliable app. I just want more representation.,Before I downloaded this app I was constantly procrastinating and getting distracted and I was very unhealthy but after using this app I started noticing how I can focus more I feel replenish and I feel as if I’m achieving a goal so I highly recommend downloading,I’ve tried quite a few apps to keep myself accountable with a routine, but this one is the best one I’ve tried.

This is the only app I’ve found that is so encouraging and easy to navigate.,This has been an enlightening start for me due to the way this app encourages the best in me to come out.

So thanks for introducing me to to my own choice of possibilities.,I’ve just started using fabulous and haven’t paid a penny but wow is this app helping me be more productive.

Plus, it’s simply fun to use, so I know I’ll use the app daily as intended.,As a sufferer of anxiety & depression as well as becoming a first time parent during COVID, my mental health left me in need of a helping hand. Stumbling across this app has assisted me immensely. My days start out with more structure and end with me feeling fulfilled, encouraged, and motivated to make positive life changes.,I’m usually very unsure of these tires of apps but this one makes taking little steps fun and easy. I was just talking to a friend about how jumping into something too quickly can cause burnout so really hoping this helps ease me in to a better lifestyle!,I signed up to do a free 7 day trial of the app (the price for a subscription is hard to find) and when I went to cancel my subscription on the 7th day, I was charged anyway. Come to find out it is over $30 for the year. I emailed the company to complain but never heard back. Now I am stuck for a year with an app I will not use. It may be a nice app, but not for the price. Disappointed with the customer service.,I’m a big fan of building small habits in order to sustain a healthy lifestyle, so I thought this app would help me with some new habits. The issue is that this has a lot of features that aren’t organized well, so it just seems like a lot of clutter and distraction. As a side note I got a notification about a “No Sugar Weekend” challenge. Since that’s like the opposite of building healthy, SUSTAINABLE, long-term habits, this app is getting deleted.,This app has helped me so much in last few days. I am actually starting to feel more optimistic about where my life is headed. I’d say if you’re skeptical give it a try, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.,The entire interaction of this company is through the app. The website isn’t functional. They charge you with no notice or warning, Not a confirmation email. This all seems very sneaky and dishonest.

You get what you put into it!,I’ve only had it a week but I really like it. I have horrible habits - I don’t drink enough water, eat healthy, workout, clean, etc. so this has so far eased me slowly into better habits. The motivational things on it do nothing for me though.,I’ve only been using the app for a few days, but I am impressed with it so far. I think this is exactly the kind of app that I can stick with. I’m looking forward to seeing the changes this app is helping me achieve.,I had such a hard time accomplishing the smallest tasks before I got this app and it really is a great way to hold you accountable. I spend 40 bucks in way less important things so this is a great investment to yourself and your future.,This is really new to me but I am finding it already helping me out with setting habits. I give it 4 stars because there are diet based goals and while I find them important, I also struggle with disordered eating so it gives me a bit of anxiety that those lessons are down the road.,The idea of it is great. But there’s too much to keep track of and click through and search for in this app. For someone who struggles with depression and anxiety, this app will only stress you out more. If it were much more simple, it might be good, but I don’t care to be assaulted with a BUTTLOAD of crap when all I want is to break bad habits and create new, healthy habits. Screw you, Fabulous.

But, the quality of the content keeps me coming back, hoping it will become more intuitive with continued use.,They somehow siphoned money put of my account because my app store was connected to my PayPal. I had the free standard version and then was charged for the yearly subscription. I’ve reached out numerous times and received an automated response to fill out a form about my concern and never got back to me. No one seems to be able to get back to me except that one time. Why look like you’re going to reimburse me to only not respond to anything at.,I stumbled upon this app and it’s been a gift to myself that just keeps giving! I’m going through a tough time in my life and The Fabulous app could NOT be more amazing, prevalent and “just what the Doctor ordered”!!! I’m so grateful I found it!,This app is alright , but has too many push notifications, too many pop ups upon starting, and has too busy of a front page for me. I don’t want to click through 10 things in order to get to my daily checklists. Should be more customizable for $35 and less invasive.,Definitely off to a great start with this free trial. Very motivational and great reminders. Lots of slow transitions and build up to make change feel manageable. Easy to personalize but I’m not sure I would pay for it. There isn’t a monthly option,I love this app. It makes forming habits so much more fun and easy by making the visuals very appealing.

I cannot afford this and requested a refund, to no avail. I despise being forced to pay for a subscription I do not want. \\nEven when I can afford this app. I wouldn’t pay for it because of how they don’t consider people get busy with life and forget to cancel a subscription.,I drank water in the morning and it made me feel drained and tired throughout the day and  I dropped my waffle and broke my bracelet and I know I shouldn’t be tired becuz I slept for the same amount of time I always do and I told the app and they didn’t care at all it’s really annoying how the music plays after u close the app and the notification sound is annoying too don’t download I feel awful 😣,I love everything about this app. It has really jazzed me to get things done in a way that I’ve not been able tap into for some time now. 4 star rating because I find it a little difficult to navigate the site.

If you’re in the right financial situation, I truly think the premium is worth every cent.,I wasn’t sure how this app would work, but this surpasses my expectations.

Developers did a great job planning and making the app user friendly and an attention grabber!,the timed daily routines with suggestions are useful, but it will come across as extremely patronizing if you don’t find the narrative of growing into a beautiful flower or whatever to be ~affirming~. also it would be nice if any self-improvement guru could entertain the possibility that some of us are trying to GAIN weight and don’t benefit from scolds tut-tutting us for eating potatoes.,Definitely loving it only down fall is it\\'s expensive. Maybe for a tad bit cheaper(not a whole lot) I would be happier.

Each step is small enough, with help, reminders, and affirmations along the way.,This is such a great app for mental and physical health.

It’s also kind of like an accountability partner, which is what I needed, so the app is worth the money.,The app assured me that it’s okay to start slowly. Too often I bite off more than I can chew and try to do it all at once and perfectly. It encourages me to slow down so I can make lasting changes.,The app is a total waste if you don’t have the premium version. It’s not customizable regarding the timing/ending of your day. As someone who works in healthcare and doesn’t work a standard shift, this non adjustable setting makes the app completely useless for me. Also, in theory, as a checklist the app is great but the amount of “self help” ads they force you to read/watch/listen to in between checking off tasks is redundant and EXCESSIVE.,This app reminds me to do basic things that may seem easy, but when your struggling with mental health or with the chaos of the world this app can remind you to ground yourself a bit, and keep in touch with yourself and responsibility’s,I am impressed with the simple steps I can take daily to make new routines and healthier habits.

Even when I completely resist.,I downloaded the premium version of this app but unfortunately it was not a good use of money! The app is difficult and confusing to navigate. I cannot tell what the point is or how it works and it is overstimulating.

Super simple things that just make doing everyday life easier.,I love this app but it’s not too easy for anyone who has been using the same name as an app for the most time and the time of my tasks and the app is very useful for my iPad to use it on the iPhone and iPhone iPhone and I have to,I’m only a few days into my journey with this app but I’m enjoying it.

Therefore I\\'m happier and more energized throughout the day which is a huge 180 from where I used to be.,Yes, repetition is a way to swap out one habit for the next - but that is not growth. Growth is learning and changing our thinking. New experiences and knowledge lead to lasting change. Habits are what we teach robots in controlled environments where they don’t have to adjust to variables like humans do in everyday life. Finally, for those who celebrate brushing their teeth everyday as a big win - it’s time to up your game. Surviving is not thriving. Make your habit thinking - no repeating.,It’s a tad hard to navigate but once you get the hang of it I’ve found this to be a great motivational tool to keep me on track. I’ve enjoyed learning to build positive habits and replace the negative ones I needed to.,I mainly subscribed to the app for the coaching but disappointed to find the daily coaching only lasted for a week or so.

It focuses on streaks, when you make it farther in your streak you are rewarded with a new video to show your progress, awesome audio too! I only have the free version for now. It is still worth it! 😁,Beautiful interface, great content, a sense of community, achievable step by step goals. The only thing I would change is the rhyming story & voice over lady is a little stiff. Other than those, I’m super impressed with this app.,I’ve tried tons of apps, but this one combines all the best things into one! A story/adventure, a checklist of habits divided by time of day, reminders, and lots of learning materials. Love this! \\n\\nI do wish I could add friends to encourage one another.,The UX in this app is a mess.

I downloaded it at a busy time and didn’t even get to really play with it until I saw I received a charge. Received an email AFTER the charge for an additional 30 day trial.

Too much clutter, kind of hard to navigate, having to use a finger print seemed a little overkill.

An app for self-help, mindfulness shouldn’t really incite anxiety when opened.,I am loving the fact that you can go really slowly to develop habits so your not so overwhelmed or you can add stuff if your doing great and get bored.

Would not recommend, would not use again,I never write reviews on anything mostly because I believe it’s a waste of time! But I wanted to write a review on this app hoping people would read it and hopefully this helps. I’m a 22 year old female, I am ADHD, bipolar, over weight, have both depression and anxiety. I am also one who keeps everything bottled up to make sure everyone is happy. In honesty, this is my second day using the app and in my opinion it’s already starting to ease my mind and I feel relaxed for once. IConstantly think about death (not suicide but just the feeling after) or everything else around me. I never think about myself I honestly never journaled before and I’ve been to therapist but they never help. When I downloaded this app I honestly think it was just gonna be like every other app but I can honestly say it’s not this morning when I started logging my habits or habits I want to begin it says reminders for each thing and it will not let me add unless it warned me that too many habits to start with can make me overwhelmed and I never seen an app that had it to where I can see the support that the creators actually give until now.I never thought I can get my life in order but this app is helping me see that I can possibly do otherwise that if I feel like I have a problem with myself which I do feel that way just because of my mental disorders I can see that I can change my life around and hopefully not have to suffer from anxiety and depression the others will always be there but I’m hoping that I can change the small parts about myself that will eventually become bigger.

It doesn’t show up under the App Store subscriptions. I cancelled it, 2 days later, it still charged my card $41.,I feel there are many things this app can help with. Especially in the new year resolution area. Mine was to be more aware of what I wasn’t taking advantage of and setting routines for a better, more productive life. I always say I will take care of something, or I need to work out, or I wish I could have more time for me. This app, so far, is starting slowly to get me into that mindset of setting a routine daily. Now, there are some quirks to the app as how fast it may be taking you, and it really depends on your life, when you get up, and what your schedule looks like daily. This is more driven for people working the 9-5 jobs, whereas I work 6-3. I really hope this works to help me in my continued growth, and I’m learning slowly to change my life for the best one yet. \\n\\nI understand what they are aiming to do with the app, just wish it would stretch the challenges a little farther, instead of 3 days and a new routine, maybe every 5-7 days so I can get used to the idea of say, drinking water every morning. I like taking it slow, getting used to the idea, manipulating it and being excited about it, but within 7 days I’ve got 4 things they want me to be doing before going into work! Plus, maybe I’m not seeing all of the options, but I wish I could opt out of a challenge or snooze it for just a few days, let me get my head wrapped around the idea of my new routine, then I can progress with my journey. I have purchased the premium membership, I plan on using this to help me with my routines and mindsets, and I am committed to using the app. So just little things I’ve seen after the 7 initial days.\\n\\nOverall, I believe in the end this will help me, but I do see where some won’t benefit and see it as more a burden daily. It’s a daily app that wants you to be committed, so if you’re not fully ready for a change, don’t purchase the premium, but definitely try the app out! They give you 7 day free trial, and with that it seems like the best app I’ve seen to help with self improvement. To a better 2021!,This app has a really good vibe. The intentions behind this is genuine. I’m enjoying it,It help me create a routine that matches with the way I live,This is a very helpful app. Very fun and straight to the point!,They help me keep track with dome daily habits that I need and I love it sm!,I am learning to be kind, loving and patient with myself.

So far, so good. 👍🏽,I love this app is so kind and helpful❕,And I am loving this app already!,Its a really good app,Excellent “Reminder” to \\nFOCUS on the little things\\nEveryday✅. \\n•Visually Artistic •Supportive\\nEncouraging and Motivating😃,I\\'ve used Fabulous for years and absolutely love it... when it works, but customer support seems non-existent when it doesn\\'t. On the one hand, it has worked for me most of the time, but it recently broke when I migrated to a new phone. Short version of the break - As long as I stay on my current journey I\\'m fine, but when I try to switch to a new challenge it requires me to sign in to my account (which I\\'m already signed into) and then it freezes. This is in spite of having followed the instructions for switching to a new device. I get that things happen, but the only option for customer support is an email in the app and responses are extremely slow, if you even get a response. I know because this is the third time I\\'ve contacted support. The first time they took weeks before getting back to me and the second request was a simple question that I sent them four days ago and haven\\'t heard back. So, I\\'m not surprised I haven\\'t heard from them in 24 hours about the break, but I am more frustrated this time because this issue prevents me from fully using the app. I will add that when I asked on the app\\'s FB page the simple question about what time of day daily coaching was posted, my post was disapproved, within just a few hours, the moderator told me it was inappropriate for the FB group\\'s purpose, and I was directed to use the help function in the app, which of course has received no response. Bottom line - It\\'s great for setting up routines and developing new habits but for its price customer service is woefully lacking.,Great app! The graphics/story telling is beautiful.,This app must took $40 from a subscription I never signed up for and they apparently don’t do refunds, so if you need help be careful because they might steal your money.,Been using the free version of the app. I’m getting convinced.

Uplifting,Learning so much!,You should download this app mehnnnn 🔥🔥,This app is helping my mental health sm 100% recommend,Love the app and how it inspires! Definitely worth it!🙏❤️,So happy that I came across such an amazing app.,I agree with one of the other users who suggested allowing you to say “I already do this habit” would be helpful. If that’s the case I’m okay with keeping the habit, but amp it up with another option. The story telling is nice, but I’m not feeling super motivated by it. I like the quotes much better where I can journal my thoughts alongside it. I also really like the guides and other suggestions that pop up that I can even quickly post on Instagram or save in my phone. However, I am currently having a hard time even locating them at the moment. I could have sworn yesterday there was a way for me to go back to them. I would prefer prompts that keep me more interested and then have a place to go back to and access them again or a place where I can better see my daily progress outside of just the journey prompt with the habits. I’m not sure that I’ll keep the subscription after the 7 day trial. It’s a nice app and I do like being forced to slow down and ease into the goals since I’m often overloading myself with goals, but I don’t feel that challenged. You can’t build on a challenge and keep the habit, but maybe that’s the point that I’m not fully grasping. I’m not fully bought in because it hasn’t fully peaked my interest. It would be nice if the app maybe asked a series of questions and tried to learn a little more about you before it forced you into a specific set of habits to follow that may not apply to you. I have tried other apps that I like much better. This one is falling short for me. I’m on day 5 of 7 and will stay optimistic.,i love this app! it really helps you to not procrastinate and if you don’t want to pay the app without the premium membership is awesome as well!,Like The title said, this is a wonderful app.,I accepted to try a free week on the app but instead I got a charge of $40 dlls in my card and a subscription for a year which I did not request.,Thank you for making me fabulous!!!,the app has been so uplifting the journeys and the goals are motivating. this is perfect for those that want to improve on themselves and no one else,Worth a try.

You’ve already helped me so much when I didn’t think I could be helped at this point. \\n\\nI’ve been really struggling lately with my mental health and focus due to several factors including a breakup, debt with no job, and being kicked out of school (attendance issues, also due to deteriorating mental health). It’s gotten so bad that my suicidal thoughts have come back for the first time since I was 16 (I am currently a 20y old woman), and my mom has urged me to seek out therapy and medication for the first time in my life because I’m worrying my family so much. I’ve been isolating to an extreme degree, losing an unhealthy amount of weight due to not eating, and crying at uncontrollable intervals.\\nThen I found this app, and about 6 days in, I have HOPE. I feel like I am actually capable of taking control and making a change. It starts slow enough that if you’re already struggling with the small tasks, you won’t feel overwhelmed. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and there’s a “zen mode” for completing your daily tasks that I like to use  as a meditative state which leaves me feeling a little lighter after (not much, a realistic amount, meditation isn’t a miracle worker). The app could be organised a little better, I was able to find my way around the app easily but for those that aren’t as savvy with technology it would probably be a little confusing. \\nAnd no, I was not paid to review this, I actually came into the app store by my own will to write this. I wish this was a paid review. I could really do with some cash haha. \\nI wish I could give this app more praise. More than 5 stars. I’m considering purchasing the lifetime subscription which is like $200 something, when I get the money for it. That’s how much I think this app is worth it.,So this app, depending on where or how you download it will come with either a 7 day, 30 day or even a 90 day free trial and then will charge you $40 for the year even if you will never use it if you find out it’s not for you. They do NOT send any kind of reminder of upcoming charge email likely looking to catch people not into the app off guard. (I’ve checked and checked and there’s not even a confirmation of payment email even a week later. Had to find out via my monthly budgeting) Their messages eventually give a cold “it was on your original agreement” so sorry about your bad luck. They do not answer any emails asking for refunds manually. You never speak to a real person. You get sent to a type-form survey that will only give you a refund it seems if you have just been charged within 48 hours (maybe) even if you missed it or if they could easily check to see if you ever even used the app. It would seem that good people created this app until you see how little they care about those who tried it but it didn’t work for them. Seems weird to make getting a refund so difficult and alerting your subscribers they’re about to be charged so nonexistent. If you do try this app pay close attention to which trial you signed up for.  I thought mine was 90 days since that was the trial they allowed me to share with friends but I was wrong. It was 30 days and now I’m stuck with an app that I will not use again because they send no reminder and no confirmation of payment email. Not even a partial refund for time spent. Just a full year charge and the icky taste of underhanded business practices in my mouth. Ugh.,this app is nice and the story keeps me engaged :)it’s kindof confusing at times on how to navigate it but overall a good app,This app keeps me on task and focused. Love it!,Helps to enforce good habits,It’s impossible to figure out how to cancel the free trial. Why make this difficult? Scam!,I’m just starting my fabulous journey and so far it’s cool.,It’s so good 😊,Keeps me motivated,This app is really cool so far!!,So far so good.,Keeps me focused and motivated.,I love this app! Very helpful with motivating and setting goals.,i use it everyday,Lovely Graphics and concept solid.  But you don’t need me to “confirm” my commitment with my thumbprint.  Kinda sketch.,this app is going to help me save myself,Great so far,I want to cancel but there is no easy way to do this. Do not subscribe to this app!,It’s so amazing,Smart, effective and fun.,First of all, the fabulous app is based on research, which I love. \\nIt has structured “journeys” that guide you to establish habits progressively at a pace that won’t overwhelm you and cause you to give up. The habits build on each other such that establishing the one habit increases your likelihood of following through with the next habit.\\nHabits are grouped into “routines”. The morning routine helps me get out of bed and have a good productive day. The evening routine helps me wind down and sleep well. You can add more routines like afternoon, work, etc. And you can add custom habits to any routine. You can also add reminders. \\nLike other habit apps, the fabulous app tracks your progress. You can look at your streak to motivate you to keep going. \\nThe fabulous app also gives you the tools you need for many habits. There are guided workouts, guided meditation, timers similar to the pomodoro method to study/work, bedtime stories and music to drift into sleep, and many other tools so that you can complete the habits without switching to another app. \\nAlso, there are optional challenges and groups you can join to get motivated by other people with the same goals. \\nOverall, an amazing app that helps me everyday. I have tried many other apps to track my habits but this is the only app that guides me to do it at a pace and order that will help me succeed. My mental and physical health have significantly improved thanks to this app. \\nAfter the free trial, you can continue to use the app for free with limited capabilities. I do think the paid version is worth the cost. It is $40 per year and you definitely get a lot out of it. But even the free version is so much better than any other app I’ve tried, free and paid.,Love love.,Day-by-day!,Great app! The Guidance is amazing,Love this app. Very cool info and coaching!,Awesome app helps alot,i feel like im lost, i gave this app a chance and i felt hope when i started to set up the app, but when it came to the payment method i uninstalled, i am teen with no money and this js disappointed me more,been using one day, love it. just the motivation i needed :),to get you to use premium and too expensive.,Fabulous is the word!,Desperately want to end my free trial before I’m charged 40 bucks but guess how difficult it is 😒 helppppppppp,This app is positive and supportive.,Wonderful, helpful app,they wait till the end of the intro to tell you you have to pay to do anything,Great app to form good healthy habits!,Fabulous just like the name.💕,Awesome self help app,great,I love this app,It’s good; try it!,name fits how i feel about the app!,Love this app so much,Do remember authorizing a pmt would like a complete refund,Fresh and visually pleasing approach to developing new habits.,Helps!,everything you need to establish or maintain routine and very encouraging and uplifting,Supper useful and dedicated,So good gets me so motivated,It’s and awesome app,Free for a week, then you have to pay after that. Misleading!,I can tell this is a good app from the 1 time I used it but I DID NOT , REPEAT; I DID NOT sign up for any PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION. The app took $40 .,nice,It’s like subscribing to a calculator app.\\n\\nThis app would make sense as a one time purchase. It’s an app, not a service. \\n\\nAnd $50 every year? What’s the problem\\nWith people? Are we all used to this now?,Beautiful as I need,Didn’t like it and forgot to cancel trial. One star because 3 days trial is scummy,Useless app and horrible support. Just a way for them to scam you out of $40.,Love it!,I was not and it cost me $35 dollars. This app is not worth $35 to me unfortunately.,Charged me without any knowledge that it would. Super disappointing app,It seems very shady that I have to scan my fingerprint to enjoy the app.,It’s so uplifting and motivating,Great App.  I love it,Sooooooo much fun stuff!!!!!!,Fantastic,Very helpful.,It’s totally worth it,Great app,It’s a great tool,Interesting,Worth it.,This is great for starting new habits and help with mental health,it’s amazing so far i totally recommend,Great app for encouragement and positive feedback!,Absolutely love this app!,This is very entertaining and encouraging.,it’s a great app to start good habits but i hate subscriptions. i’d rather have ads,Love it amazing idea,Love the insights and routine suggestions!,Please remove me from your list,Greatest app for reaching goals!,♥️♥️♥️,Loving this app ♥️,keeps me on top of my life,This app scammed me into 1 year, I couldn’t undo. I believe I signed up for it to NOT be recurring for billing.  Fingers crossed,Such a great app and cheap 😊,I love this app,Why do they want my fingerprint? I deleted the app. Seems fishy to me!,Awesome 🤩,Very difficult to use,it’s keeping me in a healthy routine,Inspirational and backed by science,Just great,this app is so great it hells you get better at building routines,No crazy about using my fingerprint to sign in. It should be optional.,Great idea and app excision.,Very good and a calming app.,Some cool features but over priced,Helpful.,I have to pay for someone to help me? great help.,It’s,Charged me even though I canceled.,it’s really helped me:),Good app,I don’t ever remember downloading this 💀💀,Love how inspiring the app is and calming,I loved it,Awesome and useful app,Time waster,Really good/cool app!,Super helpful!!,It’s cool,Love,it’s great,This app does not work and no one is answering my emails to unsubscribe.,The Daily Coaching is excellent. The Habits/Routines building is also pretty good. The UI takes some getting used to. For example, the first thing in the Morning Routine is “drink water” but the things at the top of your Home Screen are a journal prompt and Daily Coaching. So it seems out of order. \\n\\nThe Circles feature is a good idea poorly executed. Each Circle is a topic area with F*ceb**k style posts, but you get no notifications if anyone replies to your post and good luck finding your post again because only recent posts are displayed. And once you’ve scrolled down to the bottom and not found your post, there’s no way to pop back to the top of the feed; you’re gonna scroll scroll scroll aaaaaall the way back up. I’m not sure how Circles is supposed to foster conversation when it’s so hard to use. You don’t even get notified if people like your post, so how are you supposed to draw encouragement if you don’t know who “likes” you?\\n\\nThere’s so much going on in this app it’s easy to get confused. For example, there’s a Challenges section, but you can’t do a Journey and a Challenge at the same time, and you’re placed in a Journey when you start using the app—so why doesn’t the app hide Challenges until you’ve finished your first Journey? The app will say in one place }go slow and add one Habit and one Routine at a time,” but then in another place it presents a smorgasbord of options. Feed me one thing at a time or everything at once, but be consistent.\\n\\nI’m still hoping this app will help me get my shtuff together, but so far it’s going about as well as every other life improvement app I’ve ever tried, which is to say, good but not great. I do like that I can build custom routines, for example start and end workday.,Great,Excellent! Easy and helfpul,Amazing app,Super helpful!,Love this app! It is amazing!,Great,Did not like this and want this cancelled.,This is a fun and motivational app,I just find it very uninteresting and not useful for me.,Good journey,This app is great when it works for its Journeys. It it slow to get from one screen to the next when you check off that you\\'ve done something as it goes through 1-4 scenes of graphics to congratulate you depending on what all you\\'ve finished.\\n\\nThere are a few times throughout the day that what I click on doesn\\'t respond on the main Routine page. I need to re-open the app to get it to work again. Going to a different page and back to Routine does not work.\\n\\nThere are a mysterious 6 \"notifications\" that appear once in a while through my two weeks of use. I contacted support about it and they said it\\'s \"due to a feature they\\'re testing.\" ....that seems kinda yikes to \"test\" something on production for that long and not take it down to bug fix.\\n\\nAnyways. Being a free user is a joke for Journeys. ALL of the Second Mountain Journeys are locked behind Premium. One out of the two Third Mountain is also. This renders the main goal of the building blocks of this app a Premium Only feature.\\n\\nThe app also offers a 30-day pass to Premium Subscription but only through browser. Not the app. It is difficult to navigate cancelling it because of how it\\'s set up. Very predatory ON TOP of the constant in-app ad push for Premium.\\n\\nFabulous Moments (semi-guided activities for when you want to do....well anything) are great. There is a short <10min one I liked to use called Blast Off for getting a jumpstart onto tasks. Even something as small content as that is locked to premium. Can\\'t use it anymore after my trial was over.\\n\\nAside from these, content outside of Journeys is pretty busy.  Journeys carefully limit you from over extending yourself with Too Many Tasks, however these other sections feel like FOMO breeding grounds for all the things you COULD do that you can get added to your Routine list with your Journeys. Very counterintuitive for these to exist in the same space as a \"building blocks are the key to success\" type of approach.  I can see how these can (and honestly? Should.) be limited to Premium users. It\\'s too much for a new user who doesn\\'t really know exactly what they can learn from the app just yet. \\n\\nAnyways. I feel gross finding out I can\\'t even do a Second Mountain, like not even one of them, on Free. It feels like they were just chaining users like me along just to either get Premium or dump the app. Like I\\'m not mad at the price. It seems reasonable for a well designed app (fix the UI bugs and then it\\'ll actually be worth). The way in which they\\'ve fished me along to try to extract it from me by wasting my energy is disgusting, really. \\n\\nInsert Coin to Continue.,This app is great,LOVE ITTTT,Love it,Great app,i love this app sm !!,Love it,i struggle a lot with maintaining a routine and developing healthy habits, but this app is so motivating and nice.,Love it :),Did not help me form any habits and is very busy to the eye.,It’s great!,plus skeezy and doesnt warn you when your free trial is almost up. never trust an app that does that!,Get rid of it,Amazing app,As a life coach this is a FANTASTIC app!! Loving it.,Lovely app,Love this app!,THIS IS THE BEST APP FOR MY MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE,Love it!,Great app,Awesome,Us an,amazing application,Love the approach!,Such a great app.,Inspirational,Best app,Love this app,Life changing. 🙏,Love it,Muy buen trabajo excelente app,Universal  Savior Savage,Awesome!,Love this app!,I love it,S,Love it!!,Too much new age  material for me!,SO inspiring,So I downloaded this app after seeing an ad on Tik-Tok. It seemed like a great concept, I figured it could help me keep up with healthy habits and routines. Once I downloaded the first thing I decided to try was the morning routine, where my challenge was to drink water first thing when I woke up. It would’ve been more motivating if it had said a certain amount of water. I appreciate starting small but I could literally take one sip of water and check off the box for completing that task for the day. It wasn’t very gratifying and didn’t feel like an accomplishment. The second part of the routine was doing a one minute breathing exercise. I expected it the exercise to just pop up after that prompt but it didn’t. I had to search through the app for a breathing routine and the shortest one was 5 minutes. All of that is allot for me when I’m half awake. So I do the routine and while the narrator’s voice was nice she was talking so fast it actually gave me anxiety instead of relaxing me. I could barely even keep up with her instructions. \\n\\nDay two: “let me try something else”, I thought. So I chose the anxiety reduction challenge. The first day I was supposed to write down ways I avoid anxiety. Done. Then it made me choose an activity amongst a few things. One was a mirror pep talk and the other was based on holding myself accountable if I don’t complete the challenge. Kind of weird and aggressive. \\n\\nThe final and most HORRIBLE part of the app were the stories to choose from! I picked a story that said under the title “it pays to be kind”. Thought it would be cute. The story starts out relaxing. The voice is great. Then it goes on to talk about the protagonist who kills dogs, makes amputees with magic to spite his competitor, has slaves, and in the end of the story kills someone who stole his ring AFTER MARRYING A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL. I can’t make this stuff up y’all. I couldn’t sleep for an hour after listening to the story. I have 5 days left in the free trial so I might continue to use some of the sounds to sleep but I definitely won’t risk listening to another disturbing story. \\n\\nMy last comment is just that the app pressures you to share with your friends or challenge your friends many times throughout the duration of one use. It gets really annoying. The idea for the app is great but the layout is too complex and the actual processes to build habits are to simple. It needs more development. AND TAKE OFF THE DISTURBING STORIES!,Great for mental health,❤️❤️❤️❤️,Great\\n Narrator voices!,It’s a nice app.,Love!,All the free trial did was tell me to drink water,Great App!!!,Irritated with repetition. So done.,❣️❣️❣️,this app is amazing!,Great !,JUST WOWWWWWQQWWWWWW,LOVE THIS APP!!!,It’s to confusing,Great app,Love it!,✨✨✨✨✨,I love this app sm<3,Great app 👍🏽,Amazing,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT,this app is great,Got charged with the free trail,It’s great,Love it!,Huge scam,love,Best,Good app,Nice,rr,🤍.,reallyy helpfull❤️,Great,awesome,Love it!,Yes,Cool,Woooo,su,Nice,Gg,Goooood,Great!,Love,Great,..,Good,FABULOUS IS FABULOUS 🙏\\n👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,Yah,N.,Excellent game- just give it more patience,So far so fun!,Love it so far,😍,Ha sido una app que me ha ayudado a enfocarme y adquirir hábitos que han hecho mi vida más sana,Es muy buena, te ayuda aunque aveces no puedes cumplir algunas cosas la app te espera, el momento fabulous es increíble y aunque la música no es la mejor esta bastante bien,Amazing,great！,♥️♥️♥️,Excelente,Love it,Love love love!,love,Una gran App para reubicarte en tiempo y espacio y volver a tomar el sendero .

Sin duda el primero que tienes que forjar es el de abrir esta app. Para estar registrando los eventos.,Amazing,Fabulous is, well, FABULOUS!,I purchased this app over a year ago. No problem with the app but found that I wasn’t using it. So I canceled it a few months into my membership. I just got billed for the annual membership a year later 29.99 + .30 ATM fee ?. Hard to find customer service number.Don’t really respond to my emails.\\nResponded to my bank when they contested charge but still not resolved.,sometimes it can be difficult to get out of bed and want to do the morning routine but i’m getting better.it is super motivating!,I really do love the app. I have my whole family using it. But most importantly to me. I just put down simple habits. And I usually over plan make my to do list way too big and in turn it discourages me. This Application has helped me find simple foundational things that will help me On my good, OK, and rough days.The one thing I wish there was is a better start up tutorial. Just really understanding how much you can do on this app and what’s a good way to go about it. And if you’re in the middle of the app how do you go back to the beginning of it to make sure you didn’t miss important functions are keys that make the app even better.,If you’re switching from android to IOS or vice versa, expect to lose all your money because since I switched, I have not been able to restore my premium (one year) purchase which I purchased A MONTH AGO. I was given the week long free trial once I logged onto the app on my iPhone which expired yesterday and through excruciating trial and error and going back and forth through FAQs, I have yet to find a solution. I’m honestly really upset about it because I really enjoyed this app and saw genuine growth with myself. But it really seems like a scam at this point. Don’t buy. Don’t even try. find another self help app.,I love this app it helps a lot and starts off small,I saw this recommended on a popular YouTube channel I like so I thought I’d try it out. But very quickly this app is bewildering and difficult to navigate. I just wanted to track drinking more water and getting more sleep, but was constantly inundated with a barrage of “circles” and strangers supposedly sending me well-wishes on my progress and ten different windows and animations and video game-like maps that just make it a big fabulous mess. I just want a simple progress tracker with some helpful tips, not a cult-like quagmire of animations and noise and “moments” all smashed together in no consistent order. For all this trouble I would pay a subscription fee to boot? No thanks. A cleaner layout with less obtrusive graphics and giving ME the choice to just track my progress or get the whole feel-good mess of material would be preferred.,Do not download this app unless you’re committed to using it for a year. \\n\\nThe first week of June I saw an ad for Fabulous on Instagram, went to their website and was interested in doing a free trial. Before the end of the 7 day free trial, my account was charged. I noticed that same day and immediately requested reimbursement because I did not enjoy the app and was planning on canceling the subscription before I was supposed to be charged for the full annual rate of $39.99. \\n\\nI never heard back but I kept the app to keep proof of the charge on my account. Now a week later, I tried to reach out to the contact team again and got an automated response and my information has been deleted from the app even though I have technically paid for an (unwanted) annual subscription. \\n\\nI have been getting notifications that I can’t turn off for some reason and daily emails offering me different deals on other/better “free” trials. \\n\\nI really wanted to love this app but the lack of customer service and messaging trying to “get me back” in marketing emails has completely turned me off.,This looks like a wonderful app. However, during my free trial period,I decided that the habit-building exercises are pretty similar to another program I am doing with my husband. So I have tried to send an email requesting cancellation, but their email is from a “no reply “address. I’ve gone to the help and feedback section on the app, but all their instructions for cancellation have me going around in endless circles. Since I am in the trial period, my iPhone is not showing any active subscriptions to cancel. I do not wish for the premium charge to hit my account and then try to go through whatever steps would be needed to get a refund, if I can even do that. So if the developers are reading this message, please make it easier to cancel the free trial subscription, pretty please.\\n\\nUPDATE 6/23/21: I sent a message to a Customer Support email address I discovered over two weeks ago and have yet to receive any response to my email. Therefore, I have reduced my rating to one star. The people behind this app are totally non-responsive and now that they have my credit card number, the renewal of this app will probably continue in perpetuity.,Is my fifth day using it. Loving the fabulous time. Loving the organization and all the colors. All the tips. The informational short readings. Teaching me why things not just commanding me to do things. You don’t know what’s going on at first but you get the hang on it fast. I like that I can add my pin things and also follow the guides. I love the story. I love how relaxing it is. Cleaning is stress and rushed and usually a fight. But now is relaxing and productive.,I have been emailing them since June 13th since you cannot speak to an actual human. Today is June 21st and I still cannot reach anyone that can hear me out. I initially signed up online. After answering questions about myself it prompted me to download the app. Once I downloaded the app it took me through the same process which I thought was odd. After a few days I was very overwhelmed by the app. I struggle with clutter and I felt like the app was just very cluttered. I immediately went to my settings and canceled the subscription so that I would not be charged for the year. On Sunday June 13 I get an email from PayPal stating fabulous has charged me 39.99 I panicked and was so confused because I knew I canceled it. I went to my app and I could not cancel it because I had already canceled. I started to try to find the fabulous customer service number only to be led down a rabbit hole of automated responses. After speaking with my app customer service I realized I was signed up under two different emails which I obviously did not realize I had done or else I would have canceled both in time. This has been a very frustrating situation. I just want a human to hear my Situation and not an automated response.,I tested this app and cancelled within the week of my free trial period.  I just wanted to try it and found it did not meet my needs. However I was still charged the 39.99 for a year’s subscription.  However, my Apple subscriptions shows it as cancelled. I went on line to check out the company and found that they are more interested in making money than they are interested in helping you organize your life.,I had suspicions. How could an app truly help me? Guide me? Center me? And yet when I didn’t know what I needed to hear, Fabulous had the words I needed. Every.single.time. As a newly divorced, pandemic-challenged, relocated and very alone 59 year old, I wanted to burn everything I knew - particularly my bad habits- and rebuild anew from the ashes. Fabulous appeared when I needed it. And I am grateful.,I tired this for a few days NOT for me. Cancelled free trial would not let me. \\nThen today it shows it charged me $39.99 for an entire year WTH??? I mean a full year??? I can see a week or a month by accident but a year??? And no way to cancel the year. SCAM!!\\nREFUND needed ASAP!!!!!,I would like to give this app more stars but I keep encountering the same problems and the help area doesn’t reach my concerns. First off, this app is great for instilling good habits. I did a free trial with premium and I loved the inspirational quotes and the map that show your progress. I really felt I was taking better care of myself.\\n\\nWhenever I try to log into the app I enter my password and nothing happens. It’s just the loading circle. I end up having to close the app and reopen just to interact with my challenges or journey.\\n Also, I got charged $39.99 recently. No idea why this charge occurred. I wasn’t at the end of a free trial. I also am not getting premium access. Not sure why that happened.\\nThis app has potential to be great but those issues for me makes me not want to have the app anymore.,This is a lot less frustrating than mini “self improvement” apps.Slow and steady.The price is good too. Only $4.16 a month. \\nThe people who would you have a lovely relaxing voices. It’s very calming,Since using this app I’ve managed to wake up @6am daily and practice a much better, more productive morning routine. I love that I can set reminders for my goals and the app holds you accountable. You cannot move forward until you’ve completed certain task. Definitely keeps me focus. To anyone reading this and thinking about downloading, DO IT & TRUST THE PROCESS,I am in the midst of cancer treatment and trying to find a way to stay healthy and positive… I believe I found it! By step guidance and support to move myself toward a healthier,  happier, more alive, productive & present me.Give it a try; you won’t be disappointed.,I downloaded this app and did the free trial but cancelled my subscription before the start date because I was no longer interested. A month later I see a charge for $39.99 on my card from this app. I googled it and this is a common scam done by this app. I emailed them and still no reply. I double checked that I cancelled my subscription (I know I’m not perfect and it could’ve been my mistake) but it was fully cancelled. I even deleted the app from my phone so I have no idea why or how I got charged for the annual premium. Be very careful if you download this app! I still have not received a reply or my money back.,Like many other users, I downloaded this app to test the 7-day free trial. I unsubscribed on the Apple subscription page 3-4 days before it would renew for the annual subscription but was still charged $39.99 TWICE. They also make it impossible to access the premium subscription you paid for. Biggest UX issue is there is no login page! They make you go through a whole process to get an email to access your account. I followed the instructions on their FAQ/Notion page to access the premium membership and come to find I don’t have premium and need to sign up AGAIN. This app will take you straight to their “quiz” to loop you in to pay for the app... \\n\\nDon’t trust the “free trial.” I’m out $80 with no access to this “life changing” app.,So far I have developed a habit of drinking water first thing in the morning but it is really difficult to perform exercise every single morning after waking up.Still working on it .,Just got an Apple Watch as a gift and downloaded the app, signed up for the week trail with the intention of paying for the year because it seemed motivational. The app absolutely will not work on the Apple Watch, even after taking the time to make sure all my software is up to dat and restarting many times. The app on my phone tells me to email their costumer support so I did. I get an automated email response telling me to log the complaint through the app because the email is unmonitored, so I do. I do not hear back. I tried to log another help request and now the website they use for that is giving me a 404 error code making it impossible to reach their costumer support. In the mean time I spent some time reading reviews and a lot of people are having issues with glitches and unsubscribing with the same “to bad so sad” corporate response in response. So all in all I did my best to unsubscribe and delete the app and am praying it doesn’t try to charge me anyways. Very sad because I was excited to use it and thought it had a good concept and fun interface, despite the art style being non-cohesive.,I understand the $40 yearly charge, but after I canceled I received 2 $1 charges and 1 $29.99 charge that I did not authorize. This really makes me upset!!!!!! I will not be downloading again. Thank you for making me have to go through hoops with my bank.,They charged me before the free trial expired.Now I can’t get in touch with them whatsoever to get my refund as I cancelled everything 2days into my trial because it is a stupid app.,I signed up for a trial and the day I did they immediately took $ 21.99 out of my account. I canceled the free trial, waited a few days to see if they’d reimburse the money and they have NOT. When looking at ways to contact them, it is not apparent or easy to find on their app; costing me more time to try and get money back from them that I did not originally authorize!,BEWARE - there’s no way to contact customer service, there’s no way to get your funds returned - kiss your $$ goodbye if you don’t like their app. I signed up for the free trial & cancelled through the app 3 days before the 7 day trial was over. On day 7, I received a notice from payment company that I was charged $39.99. I was unable to find any way to contact the company (except for tech problems). My emails to the techs have gone unanswered.,I downloaded the app at the beginning of April and decided it wasn’t for me. I cancelled my free trial the day after I downloaded it. My subscription in Apple shows that it was cancelled and expired on April 7th. However, lo and behold, on April 30th I got a $39.99 charge for the subscription. There is no way to contact the company about wrongful charges (the website just tells you they can’t refund you), and no way to confirm that your subscription is cancelled so you won’t be charged again. I have the proof right in my phone, but there’s nothing I can do about it. Total scam - downloader beware!!,ghbgh,I’ve had this app for a few months and as a young professional working from home with ADHD, I would love to stick with this to help with all my bad habits but it’s just sensory overload x10000000. Less is more. I could do without all the extra animations, sounds, homepage clutter, and long philosophical app notifications. For something that is supposed to bring me clarity and focus I just end up feeling overwhelmed which leads me to not even open the app. \\n\\nThe UI is great for a video game or maybe something targeting grade school children but it’s a bit much for me and probably others as well with the same brain function.,I used this app years ago on android. It changed my life. Now that I can get it on iPhone I downloaded it with high hopes. Instead of greeting a familiar app, I feel the changes that have been made take away from the experience I remember. \\nI’m sure it’s good for a first time user, but this is no longer the app for me. : /,The story’s the give are just out of this world you guys should try it 100/10,The content its classification structuring features and all the presentation is good. I really liked it. But whenever I open the app within 60-100 seconds heats up my iPhone 6s. To cross check I deleted all my apps from background put the device in low power mode so that no other process runs. Even internet was not connected. Launched this app. Within a minute device heated up. Sadly, Had to delete the app. \\n\\nOtherwise great with all animations.,10/10 5 stars I definitely recommend this app it helps me with all my health routines and feeling better about myself. You won’t be disappointed! 😌,I’m enjoying the fabulous app 106 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,I was literally just a trial member with my wife that gave up on the app because I implement everything on my own, we canceled the subscriptions immediately upon signing up and we still got charged $39.99. Not through APPLE, no no no. But they themselves charged me 39.99 for an app that I deleted almost a month ago 😂 And to top this all off they purposefully make it extremely vague to get into contact with them (if they even let you contact them at all) and I can’t demand this refund literally anywhere. They use obscure host apps to post things like their FAQ’s and their website is pretty much doesn’t function. I demand my money back. I cancelled my subscription. What a bogus choice for an editor’s choice. Unprofessional money sapping leeches.,Paid 39.99 but it’s pretty nice, has me journaling and drinking water,Unfortunately I missed the 7 day free deadline and was charged $39.99. If I didn’t work, didn’t have any responsibilities except to myself I might be able to get into this. The weird video stories are too long and I don’t see the point. Maybe make an app  with simple commands instead “Drink some water now, exercise now, breathe now\\nI don’t really need to pay $ to tell me to do that.,I canceled in time for the free membership to expire without being charged. So was surprised to be charged. \\nI’ve been trying to cancel for 3 days now with no luck. Save your time and money!,I decided to try the app because they offered a free 7 day trial. After about 30 minutes I decided I was not impressed and canceled my subscription only to find out they still charged me $39.99. You don’t get a free 7 day trial.. they charge you as soon as you sign up and before your free trial is even up. I will be disputing this with my bank and Apple. Total rip off.,Absolutely AMAZING!!! It’s starts off really simple by only building tiny habits and at first I wanted to do something bigger because I thought “That won’t change anything” but it helped my with my energy, focus, overall mood, and mental health. This app is truly amazing! But the only thing that I would appreciate if you changed, is the way to pay for premium... you can only pay $39.99/a year and I really wish that you could have some type of monthly payment instead, as I truly love this app and would pay for a monthly subscription but don’t want to commit to something as big as a year since I don’t know where I’ll be at in my life by then. Thank you in advance!,Here I go...... yes, again. For the third time. I want to like this app because of what it says it will help me do. I’ve failed miserably with this app previously. A big part of that was the app was so whacky: your spirit guides floating ahead of you and it is a ball of light  or some such eye-rolling gollagalloop. \\n\\nI had received an email supposedly from the head honcho asking what was up. He said there would be a redesign of the app and they would help in some way. I see the redesign - a bit. Never got the help. But heck. I’ll give it one last college try. \\n\\nFingers snapped and crossed, butt slapped, and were off!,THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY 39.99 was taken out of my account without my permission. My phone didn’t ask for a password it was just gone outta my account.,I downloaded this app and shortly after received an email to get a free 30-day trial for premium. I signed up because I was enjoying the app, but after a few days the premium features ended and the app was showing me that I had the basic account again. I didn’t think much of it because I wasn’t using the premium features much anyway. \\nWhen the end of the 30-days came, I had set a reminder for myself to cancel, but there was no way for me to cancel because my app told me I had a basic account. My only option was to upgrade. So I figured that my subscription was canceled. \\nTurns out that I got charged $39.99. When I tried to contact someone to help me, no one responded for TWENTY days! And now they are telling me that I can’t get a refund, even though it was due to a technical issue that I couldn’t cancel.\\nDO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO or they will scam you like they did to me.,Ive been charged $38.99 and I haven’t completed the 30 day free trial yet. I want t a refund,I hate that in order to make myself a better person and fix my issues I have to pay money.Highly disappointed.,i love this app its helped me develop good habits and i hope i stick to them. with the premium stuff, i get that they need to make money and all, but still :/ it\\'s annoying that you can see the things that are locked. personally my experience with this app would be better if the premium stuff was completely separate from the free stuff (at least when i dont have premium) because it\\'s annoying to constantly see all the stuff i could get if i paid for premium when i am not going to pay for premium. thats not just this app, its like that with Flo and Spotify and im sure other apps too. but still.,Fabulous has help me so much with my health and i am so happy,I would love to work with this app but instead I’m left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Went to try the one week free trial to check it out and was instantly charge $43.29 for a year long subscription.  I won’t be recommending this app to my friends.  I feel like it is a scam.,I  enjoyed Fabulous while I had it but ended my subscription early. For some reason, there have been multiple attempts made to charge me $39.99 and I’m not sure why,I signed up with an Android and now I have a iPhone. How can I login without paying?,Dear Fab-  I updated you. I redownloaded you.  I reset you from setting just like they told me to. So.many. Times. I read you poetry and sang you songs. I gave you the last piece of Thanksgiving pie. But until two days ago, you refused to even show me my setting, coaching, or journey screen. Nada but white. Customer service guy says our difficulties was all me,  but he also said he had no answers and would chat with the developer, so I know the problem wasn’t just me. Fabulous, it could have been lovely!  I will miss you but I need a more reliable partner!  \\n\\nWhen I first started using the premium app it was fine. Then it stopped recording my streaks. I emailed fabulous but did not hear back. After 37 days, this deflated my feeling fabulous bubble. I drifted away from the app after that because it kept loosing my streaks.  It’s a silly thing, but it felt Ike a letdown when your hard work is lost. \\n\\nFlash forward by the fall. I thought that I would give it another try, so I started being Fabulous again. The app had some nice improvements like daily coaching. And then the app stopped working completely on my iPhone 7+. I only got blank white screens. I reached out to Fabulous and, well, customer service has been unfabulous. \\n\\n We had the regular update and reinstall conversations. I continued to dutifully send my screenshots showing the issue. Customer service says he will chat with the developer. We go back and forth. Two months pass with several email. Finally, after the last update, and almost three months, I can see all my Fabulous screen! I reach out and request that Fabulous extend my subscription to make up for the fact that the app didn’t work for almost 3 months of the year. First, customer service tells me that they cannot do that there is no way. When I call iTunes they reassured me that this was not the fact. Every developer can issue a courtesy code. I circle back to CS and let him know it is possibility for them to issue a code so that I can continue to use Fabulous, a subscription that I have paid for. I am told Fab won’t extend my subscription because he told me to update the app. I’m confused because that was the first thing he told me to do and the first thing I did. I even sent him an email about it.\\n\\nIf that is the type of journey you want to be on, Fabulous may be the app for you: unreliable app and uneven customer support. Take your chances. If it goes badly, it could be Fabulous.\\n\\nUpdate: the customer service fellow and I are in touch. He says he will see if they can extend my subscription but it may take a few weeks to find out. Will fabulous be fabulous or it is just trying to keep me in the hook?\\n\\nUpdate: after over eight emails, and waiting four weeks to hear “what they decided” I was offered a code for three months to cover the time my app was not working. The simple (SIMPLE) right thing—yet the amount of work to encourage Fabulous to follow through leaves me with less than a glowing review of their customer service. Now that I get to try the app I am not sure I want to love it; not excited to support a company with their level of customer service. We will see if they change my mind or I switch to Shine.,Update 1/24/21\\n\\nCustomer service got back to me and resolved the issue promptly.\\n\\nOverall, I love the app’s simplicity, both in design and the starting program of habit building. The community element is also welcome. I love the app’s “gamification” of habit building too.\\n\\nI’d give five stars if they made the transferring of your account to new devices more convenient and seamless.\\n\\n———\\n\\nOverall, the app content is good, but I’m rating the app one star because of unresponsive customer service for premium subscribers and difficulty restoring paid subscriptions when switching devices.\\n\\nAfter upgrading from an older iPhone to a new one, I lost access to my premium subscription, so I lost all my saved info and do not have access to all the features. This issue seems common enough since there is a section in their FAQ on how to address this, but none of the steps listed worked for me. I also logged in and out of the app, and deleted and reinstalled the app with no success in restoring my premium account. It seems like others have encountered similar issues.\\n\\nI subscribed to the app from a website, and it seems that restoring your account from a website is not as seamless as restoring access if you subscribed via the app store. There is no convenient existing user login page on the app or on their main website. I had to search for the existing user login page on a web browser to log in. While this is mildly inconvenient, because I do not have access to my account, I have to log in as a first time user and retake the onboarding survey each time, which only takes a minute or two but still frustrating when you have a paid account with them. \\n\\nThe FAQ also states that they cannot port over subscriptions from Android to iOS, so this might also be an issue for premium subscribers that end up switching to a different OS. In my case, I upgraded from an old iPhone 6s to a new iPhone 12 Pro Max, but I have not been successful in restoring my subscription and saved data. \\n\\nCustomer service has not yet responded to my issue; I emailed them about 10 days ago from this writing. I received a generic message from them stating that they are receiving a high volume of requests at the moment. I don’t know what the average wait time for a response would be, but, again, this feels like a lot for people that paid for the subscription. \\n\\nThe gist of this is: I paid money for a subscription, and I’m bummed out because I don’t have access to what I’m paying for. It seems other subscribers have had problems too, so for anyone that is planning on paying for the premium service and upgrading their device or switching between iOS and Android, you may have similar issues.\\n\\nI was pleased with the content of the app, and I felt that the price was fair. I’d happily rate them higher if I can get my issues resolved.\\n\\nBut the trouble of getting access to my paid account and slow customer service response time may cause me to cancel and get a partial refund if I don’t get this resolved soon.,The app is awesome! Very motivating and easy to use ; anyone who is looking to start a real life transformation should be using Fabulous!!!,This app used to be my favorite app out of my apps.He helps you setting up habits in a fun way however I change from android to Apple in this company gave me such a headache for some reason when I follow all the clear instructions they gave me itWouldn’t let me restore my purchase I regret a lot paying for a whole year subscription That I’m getting enjoy fully.You always communication is through email and email takes 2 to 3 business days to be answered.They instructions they gave me were really clear and I followed everything however when I ask for my money back nobody answer back it’s so sad you’re such a great company has such a poor customer service please if you’re going to buy this for a year make sure you don’t switch from Apple to android or android to Apple you will loose your money. Also when they returned my email after a whole week there’s no money back on the time I didn’t use. Beware this is a MONEY STEAL! They will also say they missed your email which in reality they answered via email I which I could put my screenshot pictures to show how this company works for money and not for customers.,After reviewing the app I canceled my trial and removed the app from my phone. Within 24 hours I was billed for an annual subscription. It looks like this has happened to others as well. Please report this to the FTC if you have had this happen: FTC.gov,I didn’t think this app would be as influential as it was. Starting off small never really was for me. But then I tried it on this app just by drinking water when i wake up. I find it easier to come up with motivation thanks to this app. Definitely try it out.,Try it and see the difference!,❤️,This app has been really useful and certainly helps me with sleeping! I really enjoy the stories and all the other content too. However I can only give it four stars because of the whispered stories. They are very hard to listen to and it is not relaxing at all trying to concentrate on something that should be easy to hear. In addition I wish they weren’t mixed in with the normal hearing sleep stories, perhaps they could have their own section because it’s frustrating to go through the whispered stories since they are not usable to me. It’s also disappointing that there’s so many great titles in the whispered stories and I will never be able to hear those ones. Please also consider recording whispered stories also as regular hearing stories. Thanks for the great app and in advance for your possible consideration to my suggestions.,For years, this is the primary app I use to meditate and I use to love it. The daily breathers are short and sweet so I do them almost every single day, but lately I find them less appealing. The whole “think about someone you love... now think about someone you’re neutral towards, etc ” approach not only makes for a really distracting meditation, but also makes me examine my relationships instead of looking inward. When I meditate, I try to calm the monkey mind - not feed it by thinking about the different people in my life. I already do that enough! Please pull back in that approach and guide us in the here-and-now instead like you use to. I was questioning whether or not I should subscribe to another year, but the last few months have made me think that I may not. It’s too frustrating leaving a meditation more worked up than when you went in.,I decided to cancel my trial after being billed for the first month’s subscription and they make it exceedingly difficult to do so. I emailed support with the subject line ‘account cancellation’ and they responded fairly quick with a follow up saying I would have to cancel through Apple unless it was being paid via credit card or PayPal in which case they would help. I responded to let them know it is billed through PayPal and...crickets, zero response or follow up.  Apparently they only want to talk to you if you’re willing to give them money? I’ve been forced to go through PayPal and remove/block their payment agreement and will be watching closely to make sure that works.\\n\\nI’ve always thought that a true measure of a company is what they do to retain customers, but not having the ability to cancel easily leaves a very bad experience and completely negates the possibility that I’d consider them for future use. Do not recommend.,I downloaded this app yesterday.  Here’s what I found.  There is hardly any content that can be used without a subscription.  I decided to do a month subscription to see if I liked it.  The app seemed to be working alright until I paid for the subscription.  After I was able to unlock all the content the app wouldn’t load.  I restarted my iPhone twice.  The app just kept “thinking”.  Eventually I got it to load and played a sleep playlist with several songs. I asked it to play all of them, it didn’t.  I had the same issue with a relax playlist this morning.  The app is now having the loading issue again.  I don’t know about this app being life changing but I do know it’s been frustrating which is the exact opposite of its purpose.  I will most likely cancel my subscription and try Calm.,I was lucky to get in on a lifetime membership sale & I love this app so much. I use it every single day! I download my favorites & listen anywhere. I am so appreciative of Lynn Goldberg & her many contributions to mental health. So many new content additions are wonderfully unique. I love Tasha’s grooving music & message to cut loose! And Bethany’s soulful soothing voice meditations. Ryan Harrison’s bedtime whispered stories are the best. Glenn Harold’s hypnotherapy & meditations are helping me sleep better & Bradley Morris has quick messages for busy days. Just a few of my favorites. Today I listened to Sara Ablinger & her Morning Peace & Grace was a perfect start my day. Peaceful pauses & acceptance for myself & others has changed my life! I hope you take a leap & join.,Absolutely-LOVE  this app.    This is the most expensive app I have.  So \\nI think I enrolled for the year by mistake.  BUT I now listen at least twice a day, most days. \\n\\nIt’s absolutely calmed me enough that, with help of my doc, I’m lowering, and intend to go off my anxiety drugs. My life is so much more positive in spite of the enormous responsibilities and concerns for my future. \\n\\nIf you have any kind of anxiety, want to learn meditation, need help sleeping, need help getting started in the A.M., need help with patience with someone you live with, or for so many concerns.... this app is IT.  \\n\\nThough most tapes are non religiously oriented, there are plenty that are. \\nThere’s prayers for wake up a, for bedtime, or any time. Prayers for help, for thanks, learning gratitude, inner peace, releasing pain, and learning to feel the Lord around me and to show his grace in the day’s interactions.\\nI’ve been listening for a month and feel it’s responsible for my increased energy and happiness. \\n\\nThere are so many subjects,(even tapping) with ability to search a subject. I love trying new ones and save the best.,Breethe is my #1 go-to for sleep music. I literally use it every single night and have it on repeat so it plays the entire time I’m sleeping. However, lately there’s this new “well done!” page that shows up at the end of one session, meaning the music stops. So, now I wake up in the middle of the night, notice the music isn’t playing, go into the app, have to close this new “well done!” page, and then start the session over again. If it is at all possible, please remove the page after each session and store the page in “my account so people can access it when they want. Or don’t have that page show up after the sleep sessions since they are designed for sleepers who won’t be awake to see the page anyway. I would be more than happy to give a stellar review if this is fixed. Thank you!,There\\'s plenty of apps out there that complicate and stress our lives more than they need to be. This app is worth every penny to help you find balance and peace for whatever is going on in your life. \\nI love that you can search for specific situations, types of meditation, session lengths. I love the variety of instructors and that they\\'re constantly offering new voices and sessions. \\nThis app has helped me through so many hard times and it genuinely is something that helps my anxiety and stress. \\nThank you for making this platform! Favorite app hands down.,First off the app is amazing it definitely calms people down so they can get some rest, but the thing is that there are some things that cost and I just don’t have the money to buy a lot of items especially during COVID and plus there are only 2 or 3 items in the places where you choose if you need sleep or or if your felling down or want to meditate b overall that app is great i just think it would be amazing if the prices were cut a little bit instead of them making it 90 dollars so yea but overall as I said it’s great,This app is absolutely AMAZING! For anyone who doesn’t have this app, you should get because it increases your health mentally and helps you feel more relaxed, the most relaxed you’ve ever been. And if you ever have trouble sleeping, this app has night time music,nature sounds,bedtime stories,and more! And this app will give you tips and lessons on how to relax your body and clear your mind. I am telling you that this app is amazing,and i’ve never loved a app as much as i love this one! Please get it,i am begging🙏,I downloaded this for the free trial, fell in love with it! I use it to get my toddlers to calm down, go to sleep, and it even helps me get to sleep fast. I absolutely love it! I went to keep it and saw the app company had sent me an email. They claimed it was normally $400 a year for it and they were going to give me a steep discount of $.52 a month that equaled $150 a year. Uhhh no. Went to dance through the App Store and they claimed it was $90 a year. Yeah, still no. Or I could pay $13 a month. As great as it is, $13 a month with wacky math is a form no. If they could actually figure out how much this app costs, I might reconsider it. Now I’m off to find a free meditation app.,I NEVER take the time to leave a bad review but ever since the app took away the extended sleep timer option, my youngest daughter (who is a horrid sleeper) and I have had no sleep. This was the only thing that worked for us for LITERALLY over a year. We finally got SOME sleep, thanks to my extending the time to 60mins. But nope. Another failed app. And I am all for making money. But if I’m going to commit to the most awful of the free fall asleep tools, the LEAST they could do is keep consistent. Total disappointment. And to think I told EVERYONE about this app to help them and their child sleep. Unbelievable. And I’m sure I’ll get the same canned response as everyone else... 🎶contact our tech department! Eye roll.,I do love this App. And I was excited to have Joe Dispenza but there are apparently more videos that he references in his 3 of 3. It would be nice to have the additional ones. Also, I had to turn the background music completely off because it kept playing through talks or other music. I noticed someone online had the same issue. I like the background music when I’m browsing for something but it needs to shut off when a session begins. Other than that, great App!,This app has everything you could need to help you lead a happier more mindful life. Learn to meditate programs, sleep meditations, helpful talks, active mindfulness activities, relaxing music and meditations of all types! I love this app and it has become an invaluable part of my life. This company also has fantastic customer service. Twice I reached out to them with questions and they were so responsive and helpful! I highly recommend thus app.,This is only the second app I’ve EVER subscribed to. I first just downloaded it to give it a try. After seeing all the music and varied meditations and teachers/teachings I immediately ungraded my membership. \\nThe variety is endless, there is truly, truly something for everyone. I LOVE this app. \\nAnd best of all there is always something new!! \\nGreatest app for meditation and calming ever. \\nLearning and hands on ... obviously I can’t say enough good things.,I was really interested in this app &, what small amount of free access it offered, I found very helpful & appealing. I decided to try the 14 Day “Free” Trial. I immediately got a pop-up asking me to either top up my Apple balance or provide credit card information. \\nI do not approve of apps that require this just so you can test a “free” trial to see if you want to subscribe.  I don’t know you. I don’t trust this. I am fully aware that the trial can be cancelled at any time but, I prefer to make the choice to provide my payment options when I am ready to make an actual purchase. \\nWhat a shame! But, there’s plenty other resources out there that don’t require this. Deleted.,She, Lynne Goldberg, never stops talking.  In the pain meditation she says, \" I\\'ll give you a minute to scan you\\'re body.\". Or better yet, \" I\\'ll give you a minute to focus on your breathing, visiting the parts that cause you pain.\" Then she talks through the whole minute, when do I get to focus?  \\n\\nThen as if she is my doctor, she\\'s says, \"rate you pain from one to ten.\". And of course, continues to talk.  She means well, I am sure, however she just makes me more tense and more concerned about why did I say 6 and maybe it was 7?  Not for me to be reminded of the pain level as a relaxing tool. And especially without some time to get to a good place without chatter.,So many people talk about sleep as if it’s like this magical time of non-existence to get away from everything and re-charge your battery...heart, mind, and soul. I had no clue what they meant as I always fell into the non-sleeper group of individuals in this world where everything just starts to run together and there is no ending or beginning between things. That was until Breethe. Now, I not only can sleep, I fall asleep in a very meditative state like no other! Beautiful!,I have to say I’ve been feeling really cloudy in my head from so many thoughts and with my marriage and being stressed out but with this app i feel so peaceful and the guided meditation makes me feel peaceful and happy and I feel like as long as I am meditating I can get through anything along with me praying and reading the Bible but the app is amazing and I’d recommend this to anyone thank you.,I have only been using this app for a few days but I really like it. There is a good variety of meditations and the person speaking is not annoying! I also work with children and am trying to incorporate meditation with them and the kids sessions on this app are awesome. The support for this app is also awesome, they get back to you quickly and they are so kind. Thank you Breethe!,The free part of the app is great and you get a few tracks to listen too. I ended wanting more and bought the year subscription and I am so happy I did. I have been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for years. I have medication that helps, but I still deal with it daily. Just listening to one meditation track and I could feel my anxiety slipping away. I can’t praise this enough.,Let me start off by saying the app itself is very nice and the music and guided meditations are very well done. With that said though I tried this app for three nights and had three VERY fitful nights of sleep. I tried both the meditations and the various sound/music playlists and spent more time waking in the middle of the night than I did sleeping all three nights. I wish this would have worked for me as I really liked the content, but I got it to help with sleeping and that did not happen for me.,I love this app soooo much the music, the tension release, it also helped with my sleeping issues. 1 downside is that most of the stuff on there is premium but for the most part it’s better than calm and maybe headspace. It’s like the music blended into my ears and it was bonding with me. I HIGHLY recommend this app if u have any issues like relationships,anger,sleep, & more. Pls support these guys they did a very good job,So great that you have to pay money for mental health resources ahahhaha. That was sarcastic everything needs to be free. Stop exploiting people’s suffering periodt. I’ve listened to the free ones a trillion times it’s great that there are so many options. That was sarcastic too. Deleting it after more than a year thanks for almost nothing. I did actually like some of them it just got repetitive since so few are free. I have officially memorized the first chapter of Little Women tho soooo. Oh well all the other apps aren’t free either so I guess I’ll just stay mentally ill😝 peace out;),I really was enjoying the app. But I don’t care at all for their approach to get you sign up for a paid membership. Mediation is supposed to be about being calm and at peace. I felt very rushed with their email campaigns to\\nMake decision in 48 hours. In 48 hours I won’t know if the app is for me or not. The guilt they play  as well doesn’t help. It made me feel like they were in it for the cash instead of making you feel at rest.,The CONSTANT pop up to pay to unlock additional content was beyond annoying.  You couldn’t click anywhere within the app without it popping up.  Don’t like that there is no timer or “sleep” option and you only get a set 30 mins of music/sounds.  The library of available free content is extremely limited and sad.  Listened to one and it was literally the same 5 notes played over and over for 30 mins.  Instead of being relaxing and helping me to fall asleep my mind hyper focused on the repetitiveness of the music.,First I wanna say this is an amazing app and helps me sleep even with my insomnia. As of just a few moments ago I haven’t been able to enter the app but for a second or two. I’m just leaving this in case it’s not just for me and to help others out I’m sure it is just a bug but hopefully it can get fixed soon.,The application doesn’t remind you the end of the free trial, and like this come to pick up in your wallet 12$ for a month !!!\\nIt’s an abuse and we are many to not like this kind of business, plus I never use this app and forgot in a corner of my screen, a lot of publicity for not so much making business on the meditation and the anxiety of people make me.. anxious....\\nso I Would like a refund of this app cause I really don’t appreciate this state of mind « making money on people’s who forget to delete the app before the end of the free trial » level zero of the ethic.,This app is incredible! I’ve been using the free features and it has helped with my mood and anxiety in only a week! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it wasn’t so pricy. I’ve finally found something that actually helps me relax and helps my mind ease and it’s a bummer I can’t explore other options. Other than that, it truly is helpful.,I have had the privilege of using Breethe for almost a year now. It is truly a brilliant app created by an amazing woman. There are tons of ever-evolving options to choose from. My personal favorites are the bedtime hypnotherapy meditations. Some of the options include harmonizing relationships, releasing stress/fear/anxiety, weight loss—to name a few.\\n\\nI highly recommend this app!,There are many apps out there for mindfulness, anxiety, sleep stories, etc. however this app I find to be absolutely incredible. I love the music playing while I search for what my heart tells me at the moment. A sense of calm, even if I’m anxious, peels away just by listening to the music. Thank you for this wonderful app!,This was very relaxing app and i am not a person who like to go to bed. There is just one tiny problem...I don’t like talking when I’m trying go to bed. There probably is a setting to change this but I am NOT good with technology 😂. So if you could reply on this and tell me where to go to change that setting, I would love this app and rate it a five star rating ✨✨ ❤️.,I love this app ever sends I got it it has made me fall asleep in less than 5min but there is always something popping up on my screen and I can use it 1 and then delete it and then have to get the app again to do it anonymously time I still use it but I always have to delete the app last minute and it takes forever,I paid a lot of money for the lifetime access to this app. I was super excited for it. However, it literally doesn’t work. I have deleted and re-downloaded the app multiple times. Anytime I try to play music from this app, it just circles and circles. But when I get on calm with the same Internet strength, it always works. This app sky rockets my blood pressure, b/c all I want to do is stretch and relax with the music, but I always waste about 20 minutes just trying to get it to play something. Do not waste your precious time with it.,There are so many different kinds of mediation techniques and formats on this site! Tapping, hypnosis, stories, fabulous playlists and “master classes” to keep you growing ! Well worth the investment, and the variety of facilitators and methods is spectacular. Here’s to waking up anxiety free and falling back to sleep peacefully at the end of the day!,This app has the best of everything! The music is soothing and wonderful. The talks are so enlightening and there are so many meditations of various lengths depending on how much time you have. I have been a subscriber for a couple of years or so and I can’t go to sleep without it! I love it!,I love this app, however the same thing happened with aura. It gave you about two-three days to listen to all of them and then locked them. I really like Breethe and how easily I fall asleep after listening, but I’d like to change it up and hear new meditations, but I can’t afford to purchase it all.,I really liked Breethe! It has lots of free meditation, but of course, it really wants you to get the premium. How ever it has a setting so you can only see free ones- and they do have a lot of free ones! The lady has a calming voice, and immediately when you enter the app, it puts on nice music.,Love the selection of mediation available from anxiety to sleep mediations.  Everyone  including my kids (18, 11, 10,) fall asleep to the mediation and music. I use it from everything to calming music to morning mediation. I prefer Lynne Goldberg (sp) voice as the others are way to robotic and not forceful..,Twice I have paid for the app and it does not work, tells me I need to purchase it again in order to use it. Purchased the yearly subscription 3 months ago, and it made me repurchase it  yesterday to use it, which I did.  Checked my billing to verify, and I was charged twice in 3 months for a yearly app.  Now I have to request refund. This has happened to me twice in 2 years. Frustrating!,This content, this service, and customer service is simply the best. They’ve made navigating through the day and own thoughts so much more enjoyable. Start something great!,I’ve used many meditation apps over the years, and I keep going back to this one. Love that they keep expanding and adding new teachers, I’m often finding new favorites. Keep up the great work!,Several meditations I am using regularly are helping to reverse years of unchecked stress, anger, and anxiety. It is a slow,  but consistent process. \\n\\nThank you.,This app is so good even though some stuff isn’t all free I still really love this app and totally recommend downloading it, it helped me fall asleep easy and it’s meditations are great! Recommend this app 100%!,this could be a great app except it has a few annoyances. One you play a meditation and when one cycle is over it continues to repeat never ending. When you set one meditation to alarm that meditation also repeats unending. if you make a playlist the meditations play but the volume varies greatly between each meditation needing adjustments for each one. One there must be a better app out there.,This app is a Game Changer!!! I have  had issues trying to sleep at night , and this is truly amazing to have. It works like a charm!! I have recommended it to all of my friends!!,I thought none of the apps that helps you go to sleep would work. But this one does. On my birthday using it I went to sleep before 20 minutes. It was very calmly.,I’m still in trial mode but each night the meditation/sleep music just randomly stops playing and I have to get up out of bed to start it again. I have DND set on my phone; not sure if that’s the reason the app crashes. I enjoy the meditation/sleep music but want it to play continuously throughout the night.,I love this app so much it helps me because I have 10 kids and sometimes you just have to relax and take a break so I got this and my life has been so peaceful,This app really helped me with my intentions from my eyes opening to moving throughout the day. My next goal is sleeping with intention and I can’t wait for that journey!,Make sure you set up your paid subscription to the email address you subscribed and not necessarily the email you were blasted with or you will receive no credit.,This app is life changing! My 5, 7 & 8 year old now love meditation, and truly enjoy falling asleep to the sweet words this app provides. Does it get any better?! THANK YOU! 💙,I have fallen asleep in under 50 minutes rather than hours(without the app).,The app is really good. It has a lot of options for different needs. \\nThe customer service is outstanding.,Still waiting for more stories to be loaded.. I’ve heard all the sleep stories and if I’m paying for this app I expect different stories every month .. gets boring listening to the same ones every month.,I used to have bad sleep schedules. But I got this app and I was back on track. And slept better . Warmer . Cooler . And more comfortable. If u see this . It’s worth it!,I downloaded this app because I was having trouble falling a sleep I’ve got nothing but the best experience.,Using this app was a wonderful experience. I was skeptical at first but was out in less than 20 and I have insomnia,I am loving this app. It has brought such a sense of CALM & PURPOSE to my mornings. I am also doing “The Miracle Morning” written by the AWESOME Hal Elrod. I HIGHLY recommend.  👍🏼🎉✨🎉👍🏼 Namaste. We are ALL one. ✨,I never ever write reviews but this app is amazing. It’s a guaranteed way to stop my mind from racing and put me straight to sleep!,Breath is an amazing app, it helps me when I get home from a long day, it makes it so I can just relax and chill!!! I DEFINITELY recommend it!!!,It really helps me sleep, I have anxiety and have trouble sleeping these story’s are so good! I recommend this to people that have trouble sleeping as well.,I had the app for about 9 months and just used it tonight and I had a nightmare the same night I hadn’t remembered my dream or had a nightmare for more than 3 months,I have always struggled with just sitting in silence, love the practical meditations that make it easy to incorporate into my day,I am so sick of everything becoming a subscription.  Piece of advice, be upfront about your cost.  It’s not more likely I will purchase a subscription after being tricked into downloading the app and making an account. I am not paying for content that is free somewhere else. App Deleted.,I’m sorry. I couldn’t make it a few minutes without being annoyed by the narrator’s voice. Maybe it’s just me, but I could hear the saliva from the tongue hitting the palette when almost anything was being said, and that’s too much for me.,I really enjoy the music but I wish I could play the music offline and repeat the tracks!,The sound background if really let you relax but when you choose any options the human voice so annoying and it let the nap goes away \\n\\nJust make it smooth music like the background music better without human voice,I have severe anxiety and this app allows me to get rid of it. Highly recommended to everyone,I’m just loving Breethe,Any app that can pull me out of a panic attack this well gets my seal of approval.,I appreciate this application, as a combat veteran, patriot and supportive citizen this day and age calls for hope with perseverance, the world has darkness and negativity yet, there are tools to ease the mind and it’s called Breath.,This app is completely useless without spending $90 for a year subscription. It’s very misleading to say the least.  I followed an ad to the App Store just to have access to 2 or 3 sounds, this is pathetic. I would give 0 stars if possible. Smh,This is a great app, but it’s stupid that there is a subscription to something that is supposed to help you.,I was excited to try this app. After installing it my phone began to glitch. So I was forced to delete it, bummer! I don’t love the fact that they share your personal information either.,I have a brand new Apple Watch. The app works fine in the iPhone but just loads indefinitely on the watch and then gives up. Very disappointing and support for the app not helpful in solving the issue at all.,So impressed, thank you!,This app is beautiful and life changing. 100% recommend.,I would like this app better if wasn’t so pricey!,This app helped me go to sleep and is very soothing, I do recommend it😁!!,Super helpful and makes you feel good in any situation,I thought the App seemed like a new\\nTool that could add to a healthier lifestyle but the prices to unlock the areas you identify you would like to focus and on are more than I would pay for an app.,I have been using this app for 205 days.\\nI love it!\\nA wide selection in type and length.\\nThis is now my go to app for sleep!\\nAnd customer support is prompt and helpful.\\nTHANK YOU For this app,OK, maybe I need some help. How do you get the music to continue with the phone screen goes black. The music seems to cut off. How do you keep the music playing,I wish more of the meditations were free regardless it’s still a great app,Warnings that they can track you with your data and other companies associated with them can to,This app was great until they removed the option to extend the zen like music after the meditations. Not even worth using after the update.,It’s cool but for some things you have to get premium,Malarkey “Software as a Service” recurring subscription scam. Wont even let you sample the app’s functionality without a credit card. No free version? 1 star.,App seems beautiful, but I can’t listen on airplay to my stereo system. This makes it unusable for me.,Pretty useless. Not like the advertisements at all. Did not enjoy, and deleted app after 5 minutes,Much needed,Can’t even try it without giving a credit card,Will never cancel this subscription—ever....,This is an amazing app it helps me relax it helps me fall asleep. It is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n            :)       ;)          ;),So you have to pay monthly to fall asleep. LOL \\nI don’t think so!!!,I’m Deaf and I thought this tools are awesome until there’s music and audio where there is no subtitle so it’s useless for native signer!,Wonderful for body mind and soul.,This app is worthless, and Apple will not allow you to delete it.,Ya’ll forget to mention it’s pay to use. Wasted my 96mb if download bandwidth,Pointless app,The policy says Globally it can track or trace you with your permission. Good luck with that but me no thanks.,Very nice,How do I unscripe,Downloaded this before I noticed the hilarious, ludicrously insane in-app purchase prices. Uninstalled. \\n\\nSane pricing please.,“In app purchases” means 14 day free trial and then you will be charged a monthly fee,Land of smiles?  Your bed is supportive of you?  Unreal feeble snowflakes actually use this nonsense!,The guy doing the hypnosis is a joke. Awful.,It’s no deaf friendly. :(,not impressed,I use this every night but have gotten bored of some of the sleep songs. You need to have a lot more free options for sleep music especially and need to include a sleep timer like Spotify does, other than that I really like it please let me know if you can make a change,To begin, the app was not for me. I cancelled the subscription within the allowable time frame of 14 days, only to be charged the monthly fee of $12.99 anyway. After filing a dispute through PayPal (good luck contacting the app developer directly), I was told my request was denied.,This App saved my life last year. Literally. I wanted to start meditating to calm my nerves and reactions so I downloaded this to try. I fell in love with it from the first day. I listened almost everyday as soon as I woke up. It made me feel so much better. Guided me on how to meditate bc I was a newby and had no idea what I was doing.  This app made me look inside myself and calmly deal with my internal problems as well as calmed my reactions to things and my complete outlook on life really. I was happier and calmer. I lived in the moment instead of worrying. But, I stopped listening when my soon to be ex cut my phone off and I had to get a new phone. I was just dealing with all of that drama, my kids and the holidays it was awful. I’ve had a rough week or so and I needed something to calm my nerves and make me focus. Then I remembered this app and immediately downloaded it. I have listened this morning and already feel a bit calmer. I have missed this app and when the 14 day free trial is up I am going to pay the $89.99/yr subscription fee Bc I can not go without this app again. I need it in my life on a daily basis. Period.  Thank you to whoever created it and all of the meditation help. Thank you for saving my life. Twice.,I’m wondering if this has happened to others. I downloaded this app then the next day within one hour I received over 75 spam emails.  I didn’t do anything different other than download this app.  Unfortunate since I think the app is nice but 12.99 a month is steep.,I guess if working on breathing and calming your body before sleep is a totally novel concept to you, then this app might be really helpful. That said, you can get the exact same effect on your own if you just educate yourself on meditation and sleep science a bit. And $12 a month?! That’s more than Spotify or Apple Music. Come to think of it, they both probably offer some pretty great guided mediations themselves!,Alright it’s a great app but it really doesn’t help me. But don’t get my review in the way of you enjoying the app. If you read this and you where about to get the app don’t think it’s a bad app. And it’s not worth all the money. Even though I didn’t buy it. But again don’t let my review get in the way of you getting the app😂 so I’m not a huge fan but I know a lot of people on earth have trouble sleeping, and there’s nothing wrong with that. So you can download this app it’s okay for me but.. not a huge fan😂 so it’s great but I sleep well.so guys I’m just telling you how I feel about the app. Not that I’m telling the owner they did a bad job. This is the best I can rate for this app. So again I sleep very very well. I hope you guys like it. And again not a huge fan of this wonderful app. But still you guys should totally download this\\n\\nM\\n\\nApp by rate enjoy,I signed up for a free trial; however, I was charged $12.99. Breethe would not credit my account.,Ok so, I have tried almost all the apps out there that offer relaxation, starting with calm, to headspace to so many other ones. I don’t feel like I should be charged to be relaxed, however, most meditations on YouTube aren’t helping. All the other apps only have about one feature that is free, and then they tell me I have to pay. I only had this app for about 2 days, and I can already tell it’s a keeper. So many things to try, with not only good quality, but most things are free. If you are willing to pay, I’m sure it would be an even better experience.,Nice app, but sorry... not paying that. I could legit add another streaming service to my TV for that. That’s my Netflix or Hulu bill.,I saw the add on Facebook and decided to check it out. Then found out it’s 89.99 per year which IMO is ridiculously pricey. You’re better off tuning into Pandora radio. They have a lot of great stations. I play it on my Alexa at night.,Pretty lame.  Generic meditation, music playlists, and rain noise. Can get this all on YouTube free.\\n\\nYour meditations are not unique there are a number of free comparable products on the market. You absolutely can find this on YouTube don’t tell me I cannot.,For $12.99 a month just take two shots before bed time and save the money. 😑,I sent my first message to a therapist in early September. Waited 3 weeks. got no reply. Switched my therapist. Sent the same message to my new therapist end of September. Got no reply. I messaged talkspace to tell them I was disappointed. Deleted the app. In December  (over 4 months later!!) I got an email saying my therapist sent me a message. So I reinstalled the app. It was a generic message asking how I was doing but I was just glad to get a response. So I responded to the message. No reply for a few days. Then another message: ‘hi how are you doing?’ No response to the quite specific information I had given in my initial message or my response to the first one.. so I asked if this was a real person. ‘Yes my name is...*****’ then a few days later, ‘I hope you’re doing well’ so once again I responded with a specific response about how I was actually doing. Nothing. Days go by. So I tell the therapist ( and sent a message to talkspace support again)that I don’t see how this is supposed to be helping me or in any way construed as therapy and that maybe they don’t have time to take me on as a client.. Therapist then responds (very quickly this time) that they are so sorry but they are recovering from COVID. Wow. Why would you have people providing a service that for whatever reason they cannot provide? So am I supposed to feel bad because I expected actual therapy or Counseling from a counseling service??? What is the point of this????,I originally wanted to try talkspace because I have a tendency of running away after a few sessions. I thought the low commitment of talkspace might be helpful to me. Seems like low commitment is all you get from your therapists. I went through two different therapists that just wrote fortune cookie grade short responses that I’m sure they only wrote those so they wouldn’t get in trouble with talkspace as they’re required to respond to you in a certain time frame. I feel like that system is made with good intentions, but it seems seriously abused by the therapists. I absolutely would not recommend the therapists on this app. Your money is better spent on a REAL therapist. I’m sure the ones on here are better in person, but the system just makes it ripe for abuse.\\n\\nThe app itself is great to use and the user experience and onboarding process is great and welcoming, but that’s where the feeling of progress stops. The person who pairs you with a therapist doesn’t really care who you’re paired with. Therapists can put whatever they want on their profile and they won’t actually use their skills to help you. I literally received this advice by my therapist, “You have to develop some ways of calming yourself down.” I specially sought out a therapist that specialized in CBT. And asked what sort of techniques they might know. And I’m told to discover it myself. That’s what your $180 is paying for.,Review for MESSAGING ONLY OPTION: \\n   I typically don’t review apps, but this ones a little different. When I heard of this app and how convient it is supposed to be for you I thought I’d give it a try. It’s advertised as easy texting between you and a therapist, but it takes so long for them to reply :/ ( Ik they have other clients, but it shouldn’t say working now but response tmw)  that’s definitely not what I was expecting when I downloaded the app. I saw a few other reviews saying the same, that therapist only reply once or sometimes twice ( which it does say in the informed consent you agree to when you are matched with a therapist).\\n   While that consent does say if you want to schedule with your therapist a time for “real-time” instant responses, you can do so; when I asked my current one if we can do that she basically turned it down to say that she thinks it’s better for me to have a relaxed space to type, even though I rather the instant messaging back 😕. \\n    I had high hopes for this app but I don’t think I’ll be renewing my subscription, unless it dramatically changes over next few weeks, especially with its cost & late response, for example: You text at 3pm, and you’ll get a message similar to... “expect a response by tomorrow at 3pm” type of thing.,I loved the idea of Talkspace but I was a bit apprehensive as I was reading the reviews. Many people said they never heard back from their therapist and had to find a new one multiple times.  I eventually decided to download it but unfortunately, my experience was exactly the same. I haven’t heard from my therapist and it’s been well over a week since when I’ve initially contacted her the first time. I’ve done in person therapy and I thought I’d be a great candidate for TalkSpace. It’s ridiculous that you pay upfront for these services when a response back from a therapist isn’t even guaranteed. With the money I already paid for the month, I could have had 2 in-person one hour sessions (and I would pay AFTER these services were provided). I’m holding this platform to a higher standard because you all are offering therapy services to people who are requesting help. It’s really unfortunate that more often than not, people aren’t hearing back from their therapists. I’m not even going to try to find another therapist because I don’t want to waste another week of my time retaking the questionnaire/matching with a new therapist/ waiting for their response. It’s unfair to expect users to wait 2-3 weeks of their first month just waiting for a first response from anyone. Hopefully this platform will get better and I’d be open to trying it at that time.,I never ever write reviews and I certainly don’t like to trash people but I want to do this so that other people don’t waste their time and money on this. They coax you in with a very kind matching agent named Laura. She’s quick and caring and gets you to drop the money quick. Of course, if you’re struggling with mental health issues and needing help on a budget you’ll do what it takes. Then they match you with a therapist and tell you they’ll respond within 24 hours. The guy I chose never responded. So I went to search for a new therapist and was brought to a new matching agent named Holli Fiscus-Connon who took 20 minutes to respond and was so cold and uncaring. Short answers. No apology for my disappointment. Simply said “I found you a new match”. I clicked and what do you know...ITS THE SAME GUY THAT NEVER RESPONDED! I told her that it’s the same guy and that I felt disappointed and requested a refund. Without any remorse she just told me to message customer support. Cold, nonchalant, indifferent. Turns out she’s a therapist too! Who are these disconnected therapists that treat peoples problems so casually? It’s totally unacceptable. So disappointing that this is a business that is being run at the expense of people with mental health struggles. Seeing the reviews here, clearly this is something that happens a lot. App deleted.\\nNever again,Before you offer an application that’s primary purpose is supporting mental health needs, PLEASE be responsible and ensure it works properly. My therapist on here is AMAZING. Love her! However using TS as a platform has been horrible. The app crashes, we constantly have audio issues even tho both of us do not experience the same issues on other platforms like Zoom and MS Teams. What broke the straw was needing to refill an Rx for an antidepressant. My therapist is saying TalkSpace won’t allow her to call in a refill without a checkin appt. the app is saying I need to pay $125/for a 30 min check in to get even though my insurance has verified more than once that it 100% covered. So here I am about to run out of my meds and there is no way to call anyone at TalkSpace, my therapist can’t call in my Rx, and so I’m stuck choosing to find a new doctor?! Or pay $125 out of pocket?! Wth. My insurance also told me they’d received several calls about this exact issue with TalkSpace. \\nThis is a SERIOUS issue folks. Messing with people’s ability to get access to their meds is not something you can chalk up to a “glitch” in your app. \\nI contacted TalkSpace using the only method they provide - an email alias and promptly received an automated reply stating to expect a delay in response time. UNACCEPTABLE!!!,The Talkspace Customer Help section literally states: “Some clients like to set up a specific time each week so that they can message each other in real time”... but my Therapist literally said: “I am not able to set up a specific time to message back & forth”... lol sooooo which is it?? And don’t try to respond to this comment by telling me to contact customer service bc obviously I already tried that & in response to me asking if 2-3 responses/day was typical, they responded with: “Talkspace allows you to type out what you’re feeling at anytime. Unfortunately that does not mean the therapist is available 24/7. Like most professionals they are entitled to time off work.” 😆👏 I would never expect any professional to work 24/7... what a dismissive answer to genuine concern! They also said: “Usually your provider will respond once or twice a day. Our text based plan does not include a pre-set amount of therapy” SO in reality you’re paying $65/week for 5-10 responses/week... and the responses will probably be suggestions & advice you’ve e already heard before like breathing & meditation 😆👏 I originally switched to Talkspace from BetterHelp & honestly they’re both seriously terrible & way overpriced for how bad the advice is...,For an app that’s supposed to help with mental health, Talkspace has caused me even more stress. Both therapists and customer service have caused issues. I’ve been using it since November and am already on my 4th therapist, which isn’t going well either. 1st therapist, great couple of months, notified me a month out that they were leaving the service. Cancelled every session last minute for her last month. 2nd therapist, showed Monday afternoon availability on their schedule but was never available. Customer service matching agent was not helpful at all, I did not have a session for another month. 2 months of no sessions due to therapist unavailability is unacceptable! 3rd therapist deprioritized me in favor of her “day job” clients. 4th therapist refuses to have their calendar on the app and has missed or cancelled weekly sessions last minute. Multiple therapists have missed the timing deadline for responding to messages, but there is no way to submit complaints regarding therapists. Therapists are not held accountable for their poor treatment of patient! Again, customer service matching agent has not been helpful at all and did not respond when I asked about a psychiatrist, after my therapist submitted a request for one. Overall horrible experience, do not use this service,After signing up, it was all downhill: 1) they took my money and then a therapist didn’t schedule my first apt for 1 week, 2) when I reached out to customer service, they denied my request not to charge me for the time I was not getting service while waiting for my previously mentioned first appointment, 3) when I did try to reach out to customer service to ask them to wave the charges while I waited for my first appointment, they would barely read my emails and it would take them 2 days to respond. I cancelled my service and request a full refund. I would NEVER recommend this service. If you’re considering it, read the most recent reviews.\\n\\nUPDATE: App developers reached out to apologize and gave me an email address to reply to so they could “make things right”. During all of my interactions with Talkspace, they had multiple opportunities to “make things right” and they just made my experience a drag. A customer should not have to send 3 emails to get her money back when an agreed-upon service is not being delivered. Shame on Talkspace for a half-hearted attempt at PR damage control. What would make this right? Improve your service for all the people on this forum who were paying customers.\\n\\nI reported to BBB.,I signed up for talkspace and selected a therapist, then messaged said therapist about why I’m seeking therapy. Therapist responded within the hour to inform me they could not take me as a patient and I should contact customer support. I have no idea why I would be given the option to select a therapist who can’t take me on as a patient!? \\n\\nI reach out to customer support with only one response from their team about freezing my account. I replied immediately that I want a full refund and don’t wish to use talkspace considering I have no idea if any of their therapist can help me at this point. I’ve been reaching out for 3 days with no other responses from customer support so today I create a new ticket and for the first time I receive an automated  email about a refund wizard...so this A.I. refund wizard is allowing me a partial refund of $195 so Talkspace wants to charge me $65 for being turned away from a therapist and not receiving a valid response to my inquiry of reviving a full refund. Beyond mad right now, I’ll definitely be trying out BetterHelp because Talkspace has now added stress on top of stress because I don’t make that much money so $65 is actually a lot to pay for crickets and a locked door.,My first therapist was good and I started working with him right before covid and losing my job, so he was very helpful. But he constantly had video issues or I couldn’t schedule an appointment with him through the app. I stuck with him and was willing to tolerate the technical issues and assumed because he’s not as familiar with the technology. He constantly missed/ignored the response time requested and to me who has mild anxiety issue it is very uncomfortable. He then missed sessions for the third time and that was when I decided to switch therapist. I had all my chat history transferred to the new therapist and then she complained it was too much to read. She was also insensitive to my culture AND she missed sessions. \\nI’ve been writing to customer support for all these issues and it takes weeks for them to get back. What do patients do when we can’t reach our therapists and customer support can’t help?\\nI ended up going back to traditional therapy though it is more expensive but I just need that consistency for emotional support and not letting my therapists become emotional drag when I have to worry if they are going to ghost me or not.,I downloaded this out of pure need. My anxiety was out of control. I understand with the pandemic going on that therapy is in high demand. I had tried to find an in-person therapist, but to no avail. So I decided to give this a try. \\nDownloaded it on a Friday, went through the whole intake process and got matched with a therapist...who wasn’t working until Monday. So i wrote to her about what my brain was doing, and tried my best to wait and hang in there, in the hopes that this would help. On Monday I received a message from her, stating that her caseload was too large and that I needed to choose a different therapist. Disappointing, but okay. \\nI chose a different one, and then found out she wasn’t working on mondays but would respond by 4pm on Tuesday. She didn’t. So the app said I could nudge her and she would respond by 4pm Wednesday. I did, and she still sent nothing. \\nIt’s been seven days, I’ve received NO help. I cancelled my subscription and requested a refund, but I’m only getting three weeks worth of my money back. So essentially I paid for a week of no help. I’m very irritated and still incredible anxious. Would love for this to be made right.,I joined talkspace to get help with some emotional things in my life. I needed to have a conversation with someone and instead I got one reply a day. I ended up switching therapists 3 times and by the third time I only had 2 more weeks until my subscription renewal and I knew I didn’t want to spend another $300+ to get one - two texts a day. Also by the time they would reply I’d be in another state of mind that the previous text didn’t even matter anymore, so what was the point??? I tried getting a refund, but they didn’t let me instead they only offered discounts for the next month and I of course wasn’t going to renew, so it was worthless. My last therapist was the most help and most responsive, but I still didn’t think it was worth continuing to pay hundreds of dollars. After more research I saw others had the same experience. I wish I could’ve have sign up with BetterHelp instead, they definitely have better reviews and it seems like a better therapy app than this one. So please do your research before spending your hard earned money!,First of all the password requirements are insane. It says must be 8 characters but doesn’t state any other requirements. It took me quite a few tries to find one it would accept because it just kept saying it was “Too Weak” but again the only stated requirement is that it must be 8 characters. I used to work in finance and have had multiple trainings on creating secure passwords. I tried multiple combinations of upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. I got so frustrated and tried a basic password that I used to use in high school and somehow that one was strong enough for them. I then tried to log in and it didn’t recognize the password. Tried to reset the password and went through the same process of trying to find one it accepted. It then told me several times the passwords I was entering didn’t match. I entered them several times very carefully making sure caps lock wasn’t accidentally on etc. Still saying it didn’t match. I give up. I need counseling now more than ever after this extremely frustrating process but I will not be getting it from Talk Space.,I really wanted this to work but in the end it just fell short for me. I like that they allow you the option of choosing your therapist. It was really easy. My first therapist was very nice, however the response time was not. Evening and late into the night did not work for me. I didn’t feel very supported though the day especially when overwhelming feelings came on. I was able to switch therapist easily. My next therapist was also nice and the response time was a lot better. Yet, when i would pour out my feelings the responses i got felt more like a copy and paste from google than talking to a real person. I ended up canceling my subscription. For those who are looking into online therapy, i dont think this is for someone who needs support in the moment. It more geared towards those who are busy and want therapy on the go. (You could put a message in at 5 am and won’t receive another message until 5 pm).,I went through the onboarding process with a “matching agent” who told me that my insurance wasn’t contracted with them (which is fine), but then wanted me to pay for a subscription before being able to see which providers were available in my state for psychiatry. The response to my request was “No, sorry.” Yikes. I would never pay for something like psychiatry without being able to research the provider ahead of time. When I initially did the sign-up process, it defaulted to the therapy option, and I was at least able to see those providers, of which there was only one that met my needs. In theory, this should be a great service, but based on the policies and customer service, I’d rather do the work of researching providers that offer telehealth and scheduling with them directly. I would say that this might be the right option for someone who is uninsured, in a pinch, and doesn’t have the bandwidth to research providers on their own.,It is now the 9th and I paid for couples therapy only to be matched with two different non responsive providers who are supposedly “working every day” and available yet neither of them had sessions available for the next 3 weeks. First provider didnt respond for a week, second provider responded after 4 days and that was to send 2 messages and then nothing! Still not a single video session. A member of the customer service team let me know they were working on matching me with someone who had sessions available as well as the provider who said they actually did have availability yet it takes several days for responses from the support team (messaged on the 5th and I’m still waiting). Although I appreciate the support team for trying and I’m sure covid has therapy bills surging, i just canceled my subscription for “unlimited” messages to my non responsive therapists and am still 0 sessions in to a plan that ends on the 31st!!! I wonder if I’ll even get one session in for the $300 I wasted on this app.,This app has made finding a therapist one of the MOST frustrating situations!! First they let me pick someone who was supposed to be set to not take new patients- no biggie. I picked a new therapist waited about 2 days and never received a response from them. I talked to the online counseling rep that helps you find a new one and got no response from them either. The next person I picked answered but never attempted to make any sort of connection, no introduction, no asking me what it is I felt I needed help with, nothing. She just chucked a sheet at me and said “here are some coping mechanisms”. So I chose another woman and it has been 4 days and still no response from them either. I sent an email to customer support and no response on that end. It’s like they made the app, had people sign up, and then completely abandoned it. I do NOT recommend this app to anyone. Finding a therapist is a very vulnerable situation and they make it so difficult abs frustrating I don’t know how they expect to help anyone like this.,I had the app for about a week. The first 4 days were finding a therapist that would actually respond. Then, when I had one that responded, it was like they didn’t read anything I wrote. And then after actually responded twice in one day, they had to cancel the free video session. When I mentioned I wanted something more, meaning more responses, she responded almost immediately because she thought I wanted to schedule a paid video session. \\n\\nI canceled my subscription the next day when I hadn’t heard from my therapist. Then requested a refund on day 6 but they would only offer half back. So just a fyi, if u cancel within 48 hours & request a refund, they don’t really refund all of your money. I didn’t get any use out of this app at all in any way. If I wanted more trauma, I would have visited my family. \\n\\nPlease. Don’t get this app. Don’t pay them your hard earned money. Find a reliable therapist. There are plenty that will work with you to make you feel comfortable. This app is not it.,I’m fairly new to Talkspace and I had great hopes based on this service being offered through my insurance. Unfortunately, the therapist never responded to my introduction. I understand everyone has things going on so I selected the option to give her more time to respond. Well, she still didn’t respond. So, I matched with a different therapist and went through the onboarding process again. Well lo and behold the same thing happened! I went through the introduction process and left a message. No response. Opted to allow more time for a response. No response. Wow. I’m so glad I didn’t pay for this. I’ve used BetterHelp in the past and they were amazing, but they didn’t take insurance at the time. I’m going to research whether their options have changed and if they do accept insurance, I’m going to sign up with them. As for this app, I’m deleting it and I hope the makers can find more responsive therapists. It would be very unfortunate to let what seems to be a visually pleasing and nicely built interface to go to waste!,At some point there was the ability to search the Talkspace provider directory without signing up. For mental health I have particular preferences I am looking for in a provider. It is really difficult to find providers that serve communities of color.  \\n\\nThis time around I could not search myself and had to pay upfront. My experience with the intake provider was poor. He called me by the wrong name. The intake form lacked the ability to specify more specific preferences.  After a day I was matched and unfortunately the 1 match was not a fit due to a preference I for got to mention. Another day goes by and the intake provider tells me that is the only match to my preferences when I told him the day before she was not a match. I wasted 2 days going back and forth for something I could have done on my own in 10-15 minutes. Now they will not give me a full refund. I feel ripped off. \\n\\nI strongly recommend against using this service. It wasted my time and money. For being a mental health app it stressed me out.,I tried two different therapists. The first was fairly responsive at first, but then I feel like she started being less receptive to what I was saying and became less responsive a few weeks in. After it was to the point of only getting one short message every few days and I almost felt like I was being ghosted, I tried switching. My new therapist STARTED OUT at giving one message every couple days, then devolved into only giving one per WEEK. I barely even got to give any sort of basic context about who I was because of how infrequently she responded and after two months with her I do not even feel the slightest connection or think she has any ability to help me. I am cancelling my subscription, coming out of it feeling horrible and like I will never be understood. I\\'m in disbelief that the ~$70 per week plan I was on seemed to be more like $70 per single message, all to make me feel worse and more convicted in my original beliefs than ever before at the end of all this.,As somebody who’s going through a lot, and has ups and downs. I texted a lot one day clicked the button for a response. He missed both of my deadlines then surprise a response 19 hours later. My therapist straight up told me “this is not a chat room, stop messaging me as often, I won’t answer until tomorrow.” I was under the impression that the app would give me help in a timely manner. I mean why should they give you a button for a deadline if their going to ignore it. Not to mention my first therapist on the app missed my deadline 4 times. So if you’re looking for an app to ignore you, and make false claims of being a chat room this is the perfect app for you. I’ve never written this bad of a review before but honestly if nothing changes I’m going to leave the app. If anything the app should have times were you can get instant responses, you shouldn’t have to wait 19 hours to get an angry response telling you this isn’t a chat room from the person who’s supposed to help you.,For $260, the idea of having as much therapy as possible, especially remotely, was priceless.I think the work load must be pretty heavy because sometimes there is a full day or more that goes by before I get a response. I was sent the same paperwork twice and felt I didn’t matter enough. I wanted to talk to someone which was the whole idea I needed for therapy. I was excited for the chance but I am not communicated to enough to make it worth it. I think the therapists workload must be high because I did not seem important more often than not. I told the therapist about 4 weeks ago I was done. Cancelled the subscription and today get charged again $260. Very disappointing.  Stupid money sucking app. Very annoying and frustrated.  I want my money back. This is a little ridiculous.  I will try another therapy option. This is not it. I am a huge advocate for therapy too and I’m so disappointed. Feel very used that I was just a number, a dollar sign and did not matter.,Recommendation for Talkspace: 0/10\\n\\nI had my first ever therapy session at 2:30 today. I was anxious af about it. 2:20 rolls around and it says my session has started and to join... so I join 10 minutes early. Then it just sits there and says to wait for my therapist to join... so I sit there waiting for her to just pop up. 2:30 comes and I’m still just sitting there with my nerves shot. Another 10 minutes goes by and it says my session has expired and to reschedule... 30 minutes after that my therapist finally messaged and claims it wouldn’t let her join the room. She wasn’t even empathetic about it. Girl bye. I’ve messaged their customer service and let them know that I have received 0 therapy so I will be paying 0 dollars and to cancel my subscription. It took a lot to mentally prepare myself for that today. All for nothing. I’ll just use my insurance and go to a therapist in Nashville. It will probably be cheaper, and I won’t have to deal with all that.,First let me say that my therapist was wonderful. Then, after a few weeks of building a relationship with her my credit card was charged a subscription renewal fee. This new fee was charged without any notification that it was happening and increased by nearly $100. This honestly just makes me so sad. I have experience going to therapy and taking on the task of finding a therapist so I will be okay. But a lot of people coming to Talkspace are getting therapy for the first time and many of them have chosen this format because they have anxiety around starting therapy in the first place. Those with anxiety and depression may find that starting over is too overwhelming and not seek help in the future. Giving people the chance to build a foundation with a therapist and then abruptly raising the price once it’s so much more difficult to walk away feels purposeful and predatory. These people are coming to you for help. Shame on you.,I rarely write online reviews but I figure this is an app I’d want others to get the full picture on. I signed up a few weeks ago and after going through the matching process (taking a short quiz) I was given a therapist whose description didn’t really match my needs but only given one option so I was open-minded. I reached out, then didn’t hear back for 5 days and it shows she doesn’t have any online video appointments available at all. I figure my therapist is busy, so I request a new therapist. The matching specialist, Laura Premo, let me know there weren’t any other therapists so I should check back daily. Mind you, this app is my company’s “mental health benefit” (aka,  mental health insurance we are provided) and with it we are supposed to receive four video sessions per month (clearly impossible with no providers).,Talkspace is a great service. I have one fairly decent sized problem with the app: when typing a message, I can’t go back to edit words or add anything without removing everything else typed after the spot I want to edit/add information. It automatically moves the cursor back to the end of the very last sentence in the box. Type one letter or a space and it takes you right back to the end. Highlighting a word and using autocorrect? Back to the end. I don’t know if that’s a feature in here on purpose or just a bug, but either way this affects my overall experience with the app. It can be frustrating having to cut paragraphs out to edit something and then paste the rest back in, especially if you end up doing this multiple times.,I explicitly requested a specific type of therapy while chatting with my initial matching agent. The agent said that type of therapist was available but I needed to pay for a full month of services before I could see my match. My match was not the type of therapist I needed. I spoke with another matching agent. I repeated my specific request and shared my history, and was referred to three potential matches. I asked if the matches had the certification I was requesting - no answer. I chose a therapist, again not certified in what I need. I spoke with a third matching agent, was again explicit with my needs. This agent told me there is no way of seeing specific certifications of therapists without going back to the clinical team (which I was told was done the first time before I agreed to pay for a subscription). This agent recommended I get a refund. I am canceling my subscription and will never use their services.,I got this app because I’ve been struggling and I have Cigna insurance which covers this service. I’ve gone to therapy before and it always helped me, until now. I tried multiple therapists giving each of them about a month to see if they would click with me. Instead, I barely got responses from them and every therapist I was paired with made it very obvious that this was their side hustle and they had their own practice that they actually cared about, but not their Talkspace patients. I’m glad this app has helped others, but it made me feel much worse being treated as an afterthought. Why keep a service that is filled with people who don’t make their schedules available to you and don’t feel like trying to make time for you?  Incredibly frustrated to say the least,This is a very dangerous app because it promises help to people who desperately need it yet does not deliver at all. If you are suicidal or need immediate help please seek a different source this is not it. \\n\\nI signed up on Saturday and was matched quickly by that afternoon but my therapist never ever responded to me after I wrote my heart out. By Monday night I decided to switch therapist and then realized I had to write it all out again to this new person. I was definitely not up for that task as it had been taxing to do it the first time. \\n\\nI contacted support TWICE to get a refund and had to wait for them to get back. Just to find they send out an automatic email to a refund wizard to ask for my refund. I’m furious!  This could have been easily done through a fast response or had an option to do it when I was submitting the request. No word yet on that refund. \\n\\nIf you are thinking about this go do some research on the internet of therapists who have signed up and the training they get. They are told to be vague in their responses and drag it out as long as possible. I’m glad my person never responded since likely I would have gotten strung along with no help at all!\\n\\nThis app should be banned from the App Store so it can no longer do harm to more people’s mental Heath!,I’ve been on Talkspace for about 2 months now, and it’s a wonderful program. I love that you can give your therapist feedback and thoughts at any time of the day or night! Basically, anytime you want to talk, you can go into your room and leave written or audio messages about anything going on. Then, your therapist will listen and respond, usually the next day!! The program grows and move with you. If you need more support, it’s there. If you need less attention, just check in as you like. It’s definitely worth the cost, comparing to per session costs at an office practice. I’ve reaped great benefits in a short amount of time!,First of all, I asked my matching agent when I’d be matched to a provider and was told the next morning, however I was never given a list of therapists to choose from until I messaged someone. The person didn’t respond until that night and I was not given a list of therapists until the day after. So it’s been 2 days since I’ve paid for the app. I then found a therapist and sent them a message. I was informed by the app that I would receive a response by 4:00 pm the next day, which didn’t happen. It wasn’t until 8:00pm the day after that, that I was told she was not accepting new patients. This was 4 days after installing the app. I waited two days, found another therapist, messaged them and have yet to receive a response. It’s now been 10 days since installing and paying for the app and still I have no therapist. This app is a complete failure.,I joined this app Today because I had to urgently speak to a professional and I got referred to this from a family member. However just through the first couple of conversations and I had to continuously text the counselor that was assigned to me in order to get a response before we even started. There would be long periods of time  before I got a response from the agent that matched me and then when I finally got matched , I had to wait hours to get responses to the things that I was saying. This really didn’t help me at all and the schedules of the therapist are not clear at all to me as the client. You’ll never be able to know when you’ll get a response from your therapist even if it’s an emergency you have to sit and wait for a response instead of getting the helpful guidance you need right away as I thought I would.,Talk Space, you’re wasting your advertising budget. Seriously. I came here after a tv ad and immediately filtered the reviews by *most recent*. Nope. Not happenin. I don’t know if you think us consumers are dumb, as though we don’t read reviews before we download, but I especially do if it’s a paid service. I’m one less person who will be filling your piggy bank 🏦 The reviews can make or break a consumers decision to engage with a company. There are far tooo many negative reviews mentioning that they paid but the advertised services were never rendered. I don’t have time to play games like that. DO BETTER. Or …let it get so bad that everywhere your audience goes for reviews is littered with NEGATIVE reviews and you really tarnish the brand name. I’ll check back maybe in a hear or two. Smh. Seriously, identify what people are complaining about and DO BETTER.,I was referred to this app by my sister who had a very good therapist for her postpartum. I decided to get some life and relationship advice. After her great experience and great reviews I decided to give it a try. They promise your therapist will be in touch a few times a day. But that wasn’t the case. I picked a nice therapist and it took a week to get a generic welcome message. After replying with my concerns she never replied. So I waited a week and still nothing. I thought maybe she just was too busy for me so I switched over to a new therapist. After 3 weeks and 2 therapists later I didn’t even get a reply or help. I decided to cancel my subscription but since I used the app for 3 weeks I didn’t get my full money back. I was pro rated for using the app. What a horrible terrible customer service and even more of a garbage app. Stay away.,Honesty wasted my $200 bucks on this platform. I reached out to get help for my issues because i don’t have access to traditional counseling and all i got was counselors that just didn’t reply. Like others have mentioned what is the point of this whole program, app, whatever if therapist don’t respond to you like you are having a regular conversation and they don’t reach out to you to show they care and want to ACTUALLY help you. It’s not a talk space if it’s literally filled with silence. I’m not even mad about the money i’m more mad about the fact that for lots of people like myself included, though that that this app would genuinely help and if anything it made me feel more frustrated and anxious and just overall let down. I’m telling you right now, don’t waste your time or money on this app,The app does things like giving you random  scores for “quality of life” or “BPD” without actually asking/talking to your therapist about it... you also are stuck in the plan you buy without the ability to talk to your therapist for longer even if it fits with their schedule. The app could be more useful by incorporating mood tracking and journalling or workbook/applet assignments as well (that therapists could possibly assign to users)\\n\\nIts also really challenging to get matched with a person that shares your experiences if you happen to be a POC or Queer etc,In my experience, the doctors have been good but the platform is bad. It is organized in a very bizarre way that is not user-friendly. Also, when you need help with something, it takes a long time because you have use their submission method. The matching agents can’t help. Also, to schedule an appointment you basically have to get permission to be allowed a certain amount of appointment time. For example, I need a 1 hour appt but it’s only allowing a 30 minute so the doctor won’t accept it. Which is an asinine way of organizing a platform specifically for people struggling with mental health. \\nOverall, the doctors I’ve had are good but, if my insurance covered a different app, I’d leave in a second based entirely on the platform.,After reading such positive reviews, I really thought this would work for me but I’m guessing that it’s really if you get “lucky” with the provider you pick. You get to chose from 5 options - however if you “pass” on those to see other profiles, you can’t go back. So you can’t compare more than 5 at a time which is just bad programming IMO.   During my month of trying to find someone that “fit”,  I tried 3 different therapists and had TWO providers that didn’t respond!  I even worked with the Customer Service agent who recommended one of the ones who didn’t respond.   So - if you’re feeling lucky and have $200 + to gamble with, I guess take a chance but I feel like my money and time were wasted and I’m really discouraged about finding someone that can help me.,That word is simply enough to describe Talkspace. Upon signing up you are directed to choose a therapist from a list that a “matching agent” will present to best suit your needs, and to choose carefully. I was given ONE choice. I felt instantly horrible about myself that I was just so broken only one therapist could help. I spoke my feelings to the “matching agent” and I was given more options. I selected a therapist to NEVER get a response, over multiple days. I was then allowed by Talkspace to choose another Therapist for lack of communication efforts. After choosing my SECOND therapist I have barely gotten any communication, maybe 4 text responses, and I mean the communication I have received is irrelevant to my Therapy at all. This app will cripple mental health patients really seeking help. Do not join Talkspace.,I was really excited to try online therapy since COVID makes it difficult to see people in person. I was able to sign up with my insurance and matched with one therapist. \\n\\nI wrote a nice little intro for her and received no response by the time limit Talkspace gave me. No worries, I chose to wait longer. After not receiving a response a few days later, I was given the option to change providers. I chose this in hopes of getting someone with more availability. \\n\\nI was matched to a matching agent who almost immediately told me that she didn’t have a match for me, and to contact support to be added to a manual matching list. I did this because was willing to wait until someone was available. \\n\\nSupport got back to me a few days later, only to give me a blurb about how I can chose the “Change My Provider” option on the app, which was no longer available. Wrote back and told them that my “matching agent” told me to ask to be added to a manual matching list. No response a week later to even acknowledge my question. \\n\\nI guess this isn’t for me, but I’m disappointed that I was so easily brushed aside by an app that’s designed to help people.,My husband and I tried to get couples counseling from this app. Our therapist canceled the first session, and he never showed up to the second session. Talkspace basically has no customer service at all. A couple weeks after I submitted a “ticket” to request a refund, we received an automated message from Talkspace. This was not individualized in any way. It pretty much said, “hi, we see you had an issue. Please let us know if you still have an issue.” I am beyond fed up. We paid $316 for 4 sessions. Still no refund. This company is disgustingly unprofessional. Anyone trying to get help for mental health issues, try another app. Please. This has been a waste of time for us, but I’m writing a review because I never want someone to go through what we have been dealing with.,I love this app! I paired with a therapist who responded twice a day and was off on fridays and saturdays. She was amazing! I’m terrible at actually showing up to appointments, but since I only signed up for the messaging portion, this app was perfect for me! I also experience anxiety frequently throughout the day and being able to connect with my therapist 24/7 was super helpful. Just the knowledge that I could reach out whenever I wanted and she would respond when she was available was comforting. I highly recommend this app!,These 4 and 5 star reviews have to be fake. I’ve had bad experiences with companies but this is beyond horrible. Say you sign up on the first of the month for the most expensive package which includes 4 video sessions. Any thinking person would think that the video sessions are one a week. However, after you pay you are assigned a counselor. If that counselor has no video availability for three weeks you have to do all 4 sessions in 1 week’s time! For my first video session, my counselor cancelled. He had no availability that week or the week after. He said I should get a new therapist! People who sign up for this service are obviously in a fragile state. To be hoodwinked and rejected all at once is the definition of an evil company.,No one messages you. The sign up lady didn’t write me back for a week! So I messaged her seeing if she got my messages.  No acknowledgement or anything on why she didn’t write me back. Just going on about like she didn’t write me for a week.\\n\\nThen I was paired with a therapist. It said “expect a response by 9pm.” I waited all day and no response. Next day comes... so I write “hi there just messaging to see if you got my messages.” No response. \\n\\nContacted customer service. Waited a day no response from therapist or customer services. Next day no response again from either. So now I’m trying to get my money back. It’s going on day 5 no response from anyone and I’m out 260 dollars and no one to talk to because TalkSpace seems like a ghost town and no one writes you back.,After having a traumatic event in my life happen, I decided to see a therapist. TalkSpace was convenient because I work long hours, and I would be able to do therapy on my time. My first therapist after a week said that she was sick and canceled our video session with no follow up. My second therapist after a week said that she would be taking a different job and could no longer be my therapist. On this app the therapists can also change their available video hours, or cancel appointments without notice. If you want to pay a few hundred dollars a month to text with a therapist: then this app is for you. If you are looking for continuity and meaningful therapy: I would look elsewhere.,This is such a good concept, except ... it didn’t work out too well for me. I know the therapists on there have their own lives too but it takes forever to get a response and it doesn’t feel like I’m having an actual conversation with anyone. And when communication is something I’m trying to work on for myself this isn’t helping. It left me feeling more anxious constantly waiting for a response for a day or so. Plus it’s only 2 responses a day??? That’s not a conversation.... I would rather have one full conversation once a week with somebody than take an entire month to have that conversation.,I’ve been using it for a month and feel no improvement. Touting this as a therapy app when it’s $65/week for a single response per day 5 days per week is....probably a bit unethical at best. For what people need in times like these, this is a waste of money and a waste of time. If you want any sort or progress, this is not the app for you. Book an appointment with a real therapist who offers telehealth. This process is way too slow for mental health. Good idea in theory, but it’s simply not practical and I’m frustrated that I spent this money which just resulted in wasted a month of my life where I could have had four weekly appointments for an hour for the last month and gotten so much more accomplished.,This is not worth your money. Go to a real therapist. This app has only left me wondering what I am doing wrong and why none of the therapists I’ve tried can respond on time. People come here with real problems. It’s not fair to leave them on read. I did not shell out hundreds of dollars to feel like this. I shelled out hundreds of dollars seeking help to stop feeling like this. I gave them the benefit of the doubt twice, but it is unacceptable for this to happen with three different therapists in a row. Talkspace needs figure out a better system for holding its therapists accountable.  They get to keep cashing their paycheck while I sit here paying money to feel worse than when I joined. Do better.,So, I’ve been hearing about Talkspace for a while and decided to try it on a particularly bad day when I really needed some guidance. I found the app easy to use and my therapist responsive and helpful. Ultimately, I don’t think this therapy format is for me, but I do think it’s a good service and worth trying. I also appreciated that when I had trouble canceling I was able to get it resolved quickly and without hassle, which to me is important for a service meant to promote mental health. Even though it’s not for me, I would still recommend.,This app is terrible and an absolute waste of money. I feel like I’ve been tricked or something. I got matched with a provider who completely ignored me, so I switched to a new provider on a Friday. She is off Saturday and Sunday, so fine I will wait till Monday to talk to her. Nope, I get a message saying she is off for two weeks. I am essentially paying $300 for less than two weeks of service. Also, why match me with someone who is taking vacation immediately? I understand providers are probably overwhelmed and busy, but the least they could do is match me with someone who isn’t going on vacation immediately or someone who is a bit more responsive. I am requesting a refund and am going to find a legit therapist in my city.,Two stars because my first therapist was very good and the idea of remote therapy is good. The support for the app is poor. Cost is high for limited packages. In my experience it’s more expensive than in person therapy  and I find I much prefer in person to this format. Video sessions are 30 minutes. The prices packages with one or more video session are higher, and while you can add more video time, I consider the video options cost prohibitive. I feel like I paid quite a lot to write a journal that someone kind of reads, and might respond to. It might work well for some. My preference is still in person or remote session therapy.,My second counselor, Victoria, was absolutely wonderful! The problem is with the app and the way in which matters are handled. My first counselor never replied after three days so I had to switch to a different one. I was going to ask for a refund, but I was offered a free 30 minute session as compensation for my poor experience. Trouble is, I was never able to use my free 30 minute session because nobody could figure out how to apply it to my account or nobody cared. I’m not sure which is correct. Anyway. I find it’s very difficult to get in touch with people who can provide customer service to help you.,I needed help with issues stemming\\nfrom long term neglect. Was instead neglected by therapist. I understand that everyone is busy but a quick note to explain that you’re running behind is just common courtesy and would have made all the difference.  \\n\\nI had signed up for 6 months. That’s a lot of cash I just had refunded to me.  Advice to developers:  don’t over promise.  If these therapists are moonlighting from their busy day jobs give us a realistic time frame for expecting a response.  This might have been the best experience ever but I’ll never know that because the therapist was apparently too busy to even toss off a quick note.,I started with this app and I didn’t originally feel like I clicked with my therapist and for some reason I felt guilty asking for a new one and so I spent a few weeks working with him and then I decided to switch it up and my best advice to anyone using this app is don’t be afraid to switch it up. It’s okay to need the change. I just started with my new therapist and I instantly felt a connection when we chatted. I am excited for our future sessions,1) I failed to find an orientation video to help navigate the features of the app. I had to experiment and ask questions to the therapist about technical aspects. \\n\\n2) A prerecorded video introduction from a potential therapist would be ideal for selecting the right one. There were short bios about a paragraph long. In hindsight, it turned out not being enough information.\\n\\n3) Advice for first timers; do research on the therapy methods offered before selecting a therapist. I went in blind and CBT wasn’t for me. They offered a different method, but it turns out in my case I just needed someone to listen to me. I worked out a lot myself, on my own. Verbal and written communication can be cathartic by itself. \\n\\n4) Canceling the subscription has you answering quite a few questions and feels like jumping through hoops. Includes offers for different therapists, subscription level changes, and “just in case” back up plans. This could be interpreted as concern, but we do live in a capitalist society. ;),First let me start off by saying I never received any services they claim to provide... my “therapist” hardly ever responded and if she did it was a day late. Never did a live video session, never was even asked how I’m doing. Then I decided to cancel my subscription and ask for a full refund (common sense, right? Since I received absolutely nothing they said they provide.). Ended up getting less than half of my money back. This is the saddest scam, it’s supposed to help people who are asking for and needing help and instead doesn’t care at all about your mental health and steal your money. This treatment is horrible and they only want your money- thieves. They rob you blindly, in a mask of pretending to help you.,I subscribed for four 30 minute sessions per month and when I tried to schedule one with my therapist, I was notified that he doesn\\'t have any a lot open until three weeks after. If I have to do all four live video sessions within the last week of the month, what’s the point of finding a therapist? It is better to talk to my friend. Also when I messaged him about my feeling, his response is often slow and perfunctory. He never addressed the real issue and only replied one or two sentences even if my message is very long. I feel this app or at least this therapist is not taking their customers seriously and is very unprofessional as a counseling agent.,It’s a good thing I’ve been in *ok* enough of a place so that the input I got from talkspace’s therapists didn’t send me into a downward spiral. If you’re interested in therapists lazily launching unthoughtful platutudes at you, then Talkspace is for you. Or if you want them to ignore you for a couple days - also this is the app for you! If you want to write about an event that hit you hard one morning and have your therapist respond “yeah, that’s a lot. Well, have a good day at work” then this app is for you. If that therapist didn’t interpret your response of “wow great thanks” as sarcasm and replied with a thumbs up emoji, you’ll love Talkspace. It’s trash, and I’ve read that their therapists aren’t very fairly treated either. Avoid.,No money, no help. Funny how managing mental health is critical, but only if you can pay for it. It’s not important enough that there are any free apps with professionals. This app could have provided super limited free options, like being able to talk to a therapist 1x-3x/month. Forget a monthly subscription, I’d pay $10-$20 for a session every time I felt I need it. I don’t need multiple times a weak. I was in a very and place, still am, & was hoping this app could be a beacon of hope, a light in the darkness. All of the plans were ridiculously expensive. I know a therapist’s time is valuable, but it’s no wonder so many people struggle to manage their mental health.,I never write reviews but after my third therapist in 3 months was late to a session I had to take time to write this review. This app caused me more mental health stress than help. Therapists come and go, send long curated text messages that aren’t specific, and now in my experienced aren’t timely. Nothing was consistent and I am truly disappointed in this service. The support team always worked around my issues with live sessions, etc but then the lack of consistency of therapists was so irritating. I’m seeking my services elsewhere. Hopefully  in person again someday!,Most of the providers don’t even have video appointments available for weeks. The therapists are always late to respond over texts. One told me “set up a video appointment to talk about it” instead of actually responding. Another just never responded at all. Save your money and go to a therapist on your own once or twice a month for the money. Also when I first set up my account they couldn’t reset my password (not sure how that even happened) for over a week - I tried and emailed multiple times and it turns out they lost my email or something like that. Just please don’t spend your money on this service. I really regret it.,I’ve been using Talkspace for a few weeks now and have now completed 2 sessions. So far so good! I’m going through the company that I work for which I think is really dope! The only thing I would suggest is a feature that would show you what you would be paying if you weren’t going through your employer as I’m leaving my current one soon. Other than that I think it’s a safe and effective way for one to heal mental, emotional, and self during these trying times.,I signed up for Talkspace when I was feeling extremely low and needed help, guidance, and direction. The app was SO quick to take my money (almost immediately upon sign up) but were extremely delayed on actually verifying my information. Now, I’ve paid $300+ for a month of counseling but can’t even access my account. There isn’t even a customer service phone number and the email is one mass customer service account. I’ll be disputing this payment with my bank, and cancelling my subscription. Work on your actual customer service and try to not look so money hungry next time and I might give you another shot.,I’m not sure what they think having a “matchmaker” is a good way to go about finding a therapist. It says it’s a real person but you get automated sounding replies. Sometimes they respond right away, sometimes it’ll take until the next day for them to respond. Does not seem efficient at all. I much rather just search for therapists on my own and have the freedom to read bios and decide on my own. And the long wait in between replies is annoying. I signed up and within 48 hours cancelled everything and got a refund for my initial payment. Not at all worth the $260 a month.,I have been using Talkspace for about two weeks. I love that I can text or send a message when it’s a good time for me. Or even when others are around me because they cannot hear what I am talking to my therapist about. Then to add the ability to also have video phone sessions has taken therapy into the modern age. Adding to that I can still use my health insurance?!!!  This is a slam dunk in my book!,I had a benefit through EAP for “6 sessions” of talkspace and tried to use it. Apparently that’s to text a few sentences to a therapist who only replies every other day. And it’s not real live therapy unless you pay high fees, they won’t tell you what they are until you “use up your 6 lame text sessions with a random person” even if you have good mental health coverage under your insurance! They wouldn’t let me choose live therapy, only replied to emails 2-3 days later and didn’t clearly answer questions. I’ll just wait on a real therapists list to be seen and save this expensive texting only crap for someone else.,I downloaded this app under the delusion that it would somehow replace my in-person therapy now that the pandemic has made it impossible to go into an office. After a few weeks of using it, I am pretty disappointed in the therapist-patient relationship experience.\\n\\nI don’t know if Talkspace has enacted some kind of character limit for their therapists’ responses, but I could bare my entire soul in a huge message and my therapist will give me a one sentence response. Usually it’s just to regurgitate something basic stuff you already know. This is not helpful at all. \\n\\nIf you are looking for real therapy, this app is not it. Unless you go for the expensive video sessions, I just don’t see this app helping at all. It’s more like a digital journal that occasionally talks back to you or like talking to a magic 8 ball. \\n\\nTalkspace really needs to make it clear that this app is not a solution for people who need real help. Trying to pass off this service as “therapy” is irresponsible and wrong.,I have notifications turned on but they don’t seem to be working. I’m new to the platform (and have not been matched with a therapist, as the service is apparently overwhelmed right now) and I am getting sent assessments and such, and I don’t even know they’re there because I don’t get notified about them. I have not gotten any messages that aren’t form letters, and maybe regular messages trigger notifications? But I still need to know that they’re waiting on me to fill out some questionnaire or assessment, too.,I picked someone , they wouldn’t respond in the 24 hour timeframe that they’re reviewing my notes and get back to me. No substantial response . Then I give it another 24 hours and got another unsubstantial response that they are having system errors ... okay , then another 24 hours they missed their response time again .... so I switch providers , copy and paste my notes , they have 24 hours to response per the app , 24 hours go by and nothing . My first week out of my 1 month subscription I’m paying for is almost gone and I’ve talked to no one ... what am I paying for ? Lol A journal ?,It’s hard to make it to therapy once a week and hour long sessions can seem like they drag on. With talkspace I can meet my therapist for a quick 30 minutes anywhere I can stick in my headphones. As a registered nurse and mother I feel a lot of stress during the week. My therapist is kind and supportive. I would recommend talkspace to all my friends, loved ones and coworkers.,The therapy service is mediocre; however, the customer service is the worst I’ve experienced. First, it is nearly impossible to speak with a representative over the phone. The primary method of communication is email. Customer service responds in two to three days with canned responses that do not address the issue. No phone number is given and there is no initiative to help. For a therapy service, the billing process causes more anxiety than the therapy cures. Further, 40 days after I canceled my account I was charged. No explanation was given and I received an email that I would be charged again—despite canceling 40 days prior.,Advertisement makes it seem like talkspace will provide a therapist at your fingertips, like a friend you can call or text anytime. The truth is, while you can send as many messages, voice messages, and video messages as you like, the therapist will not respond like one would think. Once or twice daily, maybe. Which means if you need feedback sooner rather than later, you’re out of luck.\\n\\nNot to mention it’s way overpriced. $3,120/year for the basic plan. That’s $260/month. Wild. Better off just finding a good friend you can vent to and using the bloom app $60/year which will allow self-reflection and therapy techniques.,I guess it’s okay I haven’t used it very long but I feel the wait times are ridiculous. I’m not a very patient person to be honest. This seems like a great app and has potential. I also understand that the providers are helping a lot of people during the day. But why can’t the matcher respond in a timely fashion? I have been waiting for a response and a match for almost 2 days.,I signed up for this expecting to be able to contact a therapist right away. The first one I was assigned didn’t respond to any messages for several days. So I switched to a new one. She also took days to respond, didn’t answer any questions I had about how to do our therapy appointments, would take hours and hours to reply if at all. When I decided to cancel my plan they didn’t even fully refund me what I paid to sign up. They advertise as being able to speak to a therapist right away and that is completely untrue. Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone having a mental health crisis who needs care.,Love the service! I have developed a great relationship with my therapist. However, sometimes I will get a notification that I have a message, and looking at the message before I open it I can see the beginning of the sentence, but when I open up the message thread the new message doesn’t show. I have to close all the way out of my app and reopen it several times in order to view it.,We tried to sign up for TalkSpace for my teen daughter. She was motivated to start. After getting it all set up we were assigned a therapist and there was NO reply to my daughters messages. So we changed to another person (did the entire intake again) and same thing—ZERO reply after multiple times trying and waiting days. I wrote customer service for help and also got no reply. Soooo, I canceled service and was charged $50 even though we got absolutely nothing from them. Super frustrating to for my kiddo seeking help and hitting a dead end. They didn’t do their job. 😑,My company offers this for free so I gave it a shot.  For context I have been to more traditional therapy at a few points in my life. \\n\\nI spent a lot of time back and forth in the chat just trying to get a 10 minute intro appointment (the app lists time slots that as available which are not).\\n\\nThe 10 minute intro session felt like being grilled at the DMV, the guy had to look at his notes to even remember my name and why I wanted to speak with him. Very curt and frankly unwelcoming, especially given the sensitive nature of the questions. \\n\\nThe icing on the cake is the therapist then quit the platform a few weeks later, leaving me to start this stupid process all over again, which I’m not going to bother with even if it was free for me. \\n\\nThis is just my opinion but it’s pretty ethically messed up to try to funnel anyone struggling with mental health into this awful experience.,This feels like a scam, they get you signed up and paired with therapist who’s availability is weeks out. Then therapist changes dates around again and I’m told through CS ticket (no option to call) that sorry your out $400 we don’t roll over the therapy slots you paid for. Sign up for the cheapest possible subscription you can and verify your therapist can see you within timeframe. Basically the onus is on you to ensure all scheduling activities are met within subscription window. Beware because this company will absolutely pick your pocket,Originally, I was disappointed by my experience with Talkspace. I felt I paid too much for what I got back from my therapist. \\n\\nHowever, Talkspace actually encouraged me to reach out to them, and I’m very glad I did. They were completely understanding and refunded most of my money. They promised that they would look into the issue and help me find a better fit next time. Thank you.,Do not get this app if you are actually looking for help. The first therapist I spoke with didn’t actually give any advice. She instead repeated back what I was saying and said she understood. I needed actual help. The next therapist asked how I would like to proceed and I said I wasn’t sure because this was the first time I was reaching out for help and he never responded. I tried to reach out to their customer support and never heard anything. Couldn’t get a refund. Horrible. Especially when someone is needing real help. Don’t waste your time, money, and self worth with this app. There are better options.,I was very specific about what I was hoping for. I had two therapists lose track of who I was and what I had sent them - they both sent canned responses that didn’t actually reflect that they had read anything I submitted. One even admitted he got too many new clients assigned to him and couldn’t keep track. It was very impersonal and actually created more harm for me. When I contacted support to cancel and get a refund, there is a 21 day wait to hear back from them. Maybe Talkspace used to be good, but they’ve outgrown their ability to effectively provide therapy.,Even though my therapist was amazing talk space ruined my experience. I have been overcharged for services and have requested copies of my invoices multiple times and still have yet to get them. For two weeks I’ve been trying to get in touch with customer service there is no one 800 number to talk to them and they don’t respond to emails. Therapist are amazing but be careful on how they charge you. I would recommend using traditional therapy with everything being on zoom you can have the same concept and don’t have to worry about over charging.,I like the therapist options I’ve been able to choose from but the chat function is not valuable to me and $400+ is exorbitant for 4 30 minute therapy session when I have insurance that covers them in network with longer sessions. After I cancelled my subscription Talkspace charged me another $400 which I had to dispute for a refund and then they cancelled my 4th session I had already paid for. I appreciate my therapist but I will NEVER use Talkspace again or recommend to friends and family. In fact I will be warning them away. So disappointed in this company.,These people are constantly over charging me. They don’t give refunds either they’re customer support is garbage literally nonexistent. They charged me 3 times in my first month even though I constantly tried to keep up with their customer support through email it was a dead end. I found a number you can call and it just sends you to voicemail nobody actually calls you back. They’re taking advantage of people who aren’t in a good headspace. If you’re thinking about using this app just go to another one. This is ridiculous.,Although the app concept seems great, the problem is talkspace has no control over the extremely unprofessional providers to contract with. After paying them $300 for the privilege of booking a month of sessions, I have had zero sessions because I have been touched a grand total of five times by providers. They literally just do not show up to appointments. And all you can do is message talkspace and get a generic customer service response. It absolutely stinks and I would not recommend this to anybody.,I had really high hopes for this app but unfortunately, they don’t respond on the time they give you. They’re not really helpful and the matches are bad. Great concept, horrible execution. I think I could help myself by read a self help book more than any advice/response that someone could offer through talk space. I can’t believe how much money to get one disconnected, disingenuous response (if they do respond). So disappointed and more disappointing that they use celebrities to endorse this app. Never again, if you’re thinking about - don’t do it. Seek help elsewhere.,I don’t understand why we need pay for therapy??? I am currently struggling with my mental health and I always wanted to do therapy. I found this app from ad I saw. To my disappointment. It wasn’t free and I had buy upfront to talk to therapist. I honestly wish I could speak to therapist. I am currently unemployed college student and struggling to stay above. I thought at first, you didn’t have pay and you just pay for video chats. You can chat for free but you have pay for that as well. A lot of people after pandemic are still struggling and including teens all over,I’m honestly shocked how basic and lackluster this service has been. It is way overpriced for what you get. I tried two different providers and had the same issues with sending an update with insights, goals, etc. and getting back one line responses. The “advice” was extremely basic or something any of your friends could offer - nothing insightful or thought provoking in the least, rarely did they even ask a question. In an attempt to commit to this, I signed up for a 3 month subscription and it’s a complete waste of money.,The only assurance I had that my second therapist wasn’t a bot was that she had an article on Psychology Today. The first never got past the intro message. It was a business week without any holidays for added context.\\n\\nValidating is well and good, but when you’re parroting back to me what took paragraphs and paragraphs of painful introspection without giving tools on what to do, it’s not unlike punching someone in the nose and letting that person know they’ve got some red on them.\\n\\nI wish I could get my money and two weeks back, but I don’t see that happening.,The initial match took about a day. Then the first provider I matched up never responded to me after a few days of trying I switched. Then the next provider introduced herself, got in an accident and never bother to chat again. I filed an issue with the app, decided to give it one last try and right after the last provider finally shared some useful thoughts the app without warning canceled my subscription telling me they’d refund me in 3-5 days. Maybe it was just bad timing, but they should communicate with their clients as an app/provider.,I first used this application in 2018, I was working as a very busy therapist and recognized the need for therapy myself so the format was perfect. I was in therapy for about 8 months and it was very helpful. Started going through some things recently and wanted to start again and the experience was so bad I feel horrible for even referring anyone to it since then. I’ve spent years referring people to the app and now I’m worried and will probably call and recant my raving reviews. Pass until they get back to their roots because it’s gone downhill since I used it.,I never review apps, but my psychiatrist has help me so much and I love the fact that I can just text her whenever and she text me back and then our videos that sessions help a lot, I have been so much better and I’ve gotten the help that I needed since I’ve gotten this app! 150% recommended... she really cares so much, thank you Mrs. Lovette,I\\'ve had such an awful experience on Talkspace and wondering why they\\'re still in business! As a company providing mental health to people who desperately it, it\\'s sad that they\\'re rather stressing their patients out. After being matched to a new therapist, she has NEVER responded to my messages and doesn’t even have any availability for video calls in the next 3 weeks. Even when trying to change this therapist, I kept getting an error message. This app is too frustrating to be real. I wish I could give a 0 star.,Cost: with insurance, this was still about $300 a month. And I was forced to purchase 1 month in advance and now cannot get a refund after just 1 day\\nResponsiveness: it says unlimited messaging but that is misleading, the doctor relies MAYBE a few times a day and multiple hours later. I had 1 doctor that NEVER replied and then was off for the next 2 days. \\nSummary: the responsiveness from the doctors on here is horrid. Considering cost, insult to injury. This service is horrid and I would absolutely not recommend.,My job was offering 3 free months of therapy and I was super excited because I was really at a low point in my life where I didn’t want but I really needed someone to talk to. My therapist was very interactive and not helpful whatsoever. There would be days or weeks where she hadn’t responded and when she did it was like she responded to parts or said things like “you’re just gonna have to deal with this one” after explaining how I felt or what was disturbing me. I would much rather have a therapist that cares and one that I can speak to face to face,My last review got deleted. This app does not provide the service it appears to. Like the other reviews say its not a texting therapy app, you wait for hours and don\\'t get responses. Talk space has a 1 star review on BBB which is pretty safe to say its a scam. Its a shame to profit off of people searching for help is such a dark time. Shame on you talk space. For the amount of money required to sign up vs the product given in return it is clear this is not a good company or app. \\n\\nTo the customer support team and whoever is reading these reviews I want a refund.,Signed up for this bc a friend of mine has been having good sessions with doctors on here.  1st match, dr doesn’t have medication permissions in my state.  2nd doctor, intake was 2.5 hours long where at the end, she refused to prescribe me unless I was totally off cannabis. 3rd doctor, no response and blamed internet connections on me.  4th doctor ( and final bc I gave up on this stupid app ) told me to see someone in person bc his schedule was full.  \\n\\nNo thanks. I’ll just suffer without medication OR therapy and hope my life stays well bc these doctors can’t handle workload, or are complete imbeciles.,You have to pay up front. Then they let you pick from available counselors in your area. I picked someone and she immediately came back and said she had a full time job and wasn’t available. I went into a never ending loop of not being assigned to anyone. Meanwhile, I paid 400 dollars for nothing. Trust me, stick to in person - real people. This is glitchy and disorganized. No one knows what they are doing and you just become frustrated and overwhelmed which is counter intuitive for this kind of app.,Honestly I thought that with virtual sessions and the ability to text it would be better than an in person session, especially during a pandemic. The worst part is to pay over $300 for a month of service and already the first text it says expect a response by 8:00pm and I get a response at almost midnight. Then the first and only 30 minute live chat for the month has to be rescheduled after waiting for over half of the session. Honestly at this point I would really like a refund. So disappointed.,Honestly I don’t even have the energy to write this but I’ve been really down lately and I thought maybe this app would help. I tried downloading it once and nothing happened. Then today I was having a mental breakdown and was trying to use this to help and can’t get past the signup. It really just set me off, now I’m in a much worse place. It’s really just upsetting when the last thing you felt you could turn to doesn’t wanna work for you either. It made me feel much more hopeless than I already did.,This app is designed horribly. It’s impossible to add new rooms/chats with different providers. I wanted to see both a Therapist and a Psychiatrist, but not only is therapy the only service covered by insurance, but I paid $300 for a Psychiatry consultation and still have not been matched with a Psychiatrist for over 3 days. They keep asking me to pay more for services that I have already paid for. It shouldn’t be this hard to design a usable app for a service that costs so much money and deals with urgent healthcare.,This app is hands down the biggest scam/rip off. I went out of my comfort zone to look for help when I needed it the most, I’ve never been one to even think about therapy. I struggled with finding a decent therapist here in Vegas, so I turned to this app. The “therapists” reply when they want which is once a day, and then you don’t hear from them for another couple of days. They stop talking to you AS SOON as you start. I seriously don’t understand how this app is even a thing let alone has good reviews. WASTE OF $300. I WILL NEVER TRUST THERAPY AGAIN.,I first used this app last year in the midst of the pandemic and my therapist was outstanding. She replied every day with tools and feedback that helped more than any therapy I have ever used. I signed up again a week ago and wasn’t able to get the same therapist. The therapist I chose only gave me one reply of any substance over 4 days, so I opted to change. New therapist hasn’t responded at all. Probably will cancel subscription and try a different service.,The app sounds good in concept, but in reality I found it useless. They make you pay for a month at a time with no guarantee your therapist will respond to you. My therapist was super pushy about doing a video call. She asked good questions but never helped me work through my problems. I finally just asked point blank for suggestions for my anxiety and was ghosted. Save your time, save your money, look into therapists that work near you instead of wasting your time to end up disappointed.,Please save yourself the time and money. The providers on this app are swamped and rather than hire more therapists or making it impossible to match with therapists who have no available appointments (due to too many clients), the app just matches you with folks who end up being unresponsive and inattentive. If you’re looking for convenient therapy, just go the old fashioned route. They won’t even give a refund, only credit that you can put toward an additional month of terrible service.,Absolutely zero customer service. Providers are allowed to cancel on you last minute multiple times. Providers have even communicated that they can’t figure out the app or have even said they are quitting. And there is nobody to actually help with that, instead it’s just blamed on not finding the “right match.” You can go months without having an actual appointment - this is just another health tech company that ignores the need for human care. You’re better off somewhere else.,Talkspace preys on people seeking help for their mental health and then IGNORES them. Review after review details the same experience I just had. I paid up front and received ZERO help. I was offered a “refund” for less than what I paid, with the disclaimer that if I “waived” it I would not be entitled to any refund. So I threw away about $50 on absolutely nothing. This is an excellent business model if you have no conscious. Unfortunately I trusted that a mental health app that is so well known would be competent and caring, Talkspace is not.,I am so disappointed in Talk Space. The therapists are horrible.  They did not seem to read our last correspondence and kept asking the same questions over and over. Gave literally no advice. The communication is maybe one sentence, once a day. It made things worse for me. Instead of helping me, they made me feel bad and told me to figure out ways to fix the things that were wrong with me. I just can’t believe that this service is even legal. It should be reported to the BBB.,TalkSpace facilitating therapeutic connection during unfathomable COVID is priceless. I cannot think of any better thing that has happened during the pandemic. Hopefully, more and more and MORE people will hop on board and gain the benefits of therapy that we all need, whether we know it, acknowledge it or not.,I have left a voicemail with talk space and have not heard back yet. It has been almost a week.\\n\\nI signed up because I needed help. It took a very long time to get through the insane process to get connected with a doctor. I needed a psychiatrist but I was signed up through the psychology side of things. They charged me for that, then I switched to psychiatry and found out they do not treat ADD, which is what I told my “sign up helper” from the very beginning. I told her never mind and that they couldn’t help me.\\nNow I’ve been charged $700 with absolutely no follow up from them as to why I haven’t used the service. \\n\\nBe very careful with this app. They will take your money and not help you.\\nI am assuming the people that help you sign up make bonuses for how many people they can pull in.,Don’t waste your time or money if you have a support system of any type. I was looking for therapy to help address issues. No issues were addressed. Over the course of two weeks the only take away I received was how to properly take deep breaths. This would be ok for people that didn’t have ANYONE to talk to, or access to the internet where they could find these generic solutions for themselves. If you need real help, this is not it and please don’t let them make you feel bad!,I think talk space is a little hard to get into and involved in. It is certainly not a Way that I did therapy 40 years ago. Not everyone is tech savvy and I think that creates uneasiness for some of us.\\nI had my first video session today and things seem to be falling into place easier now,I have been trying to connect with a therapist for over 6 weeks now. When I finally find someone I was able to book video sessions with, and then waited a week for an appointment, the app wouldn’t work, leaving me having to reschedule for another week out. Then when I submitted a ticket to escalate the issue and make sure I didn’t get charged, the app says that the message failed to send. Horrible app and worse service. Avoid if you can.,I have a bachelor’s in psychology and some of the “therapists” I’ve interacted with on this app seem less qualified to support and help clients than I am. They offer little to no help with mental health issues, regardless of how big or small the problem. I was hoping for a therapy option that fit my busy schedule but this definitely wasn’t it. It’s clear that the providers on this app are not top-tier quality. ☹️,Went through two therapists who took days to respond and cancelled my video sessions. Don’t know if they’re giving the therapists too many clients or what.  I had to quit my subscription early since I didn’t want to get frustrated by a third therapist in just a months time.\\nThey keep trying to give you discounts to continue, but it doesn’t seem they’re addressing the problem of either flaky or overworked therapists.,While the idea of being able to talk with a therapist whenever you’d like throughout the day is great, it’s equally as frustrating to not get a response back for numerous hours and sometimes days later. For those that are struggling with mental health and need someone to talk to the pricing of Talkspace is too high without having insurance. The cost of $260 a month is only $15 less than my monthly car payment. There should be sliding fees or options for those that don’t have insurance.,TalkSpace helped me when no one else would. The medical  is WAY too slow and doesn\\'t take into account the urgency of mental health needs. 12/10 recommended 🙌🏾 They were able to pair me with an amazing psychiatrist and get a first time appointment within 48 hours,I’ve now spent a couple hours on the app waiting for an appointment match. The match provider keeps switching. Right after I get through a conversation it says the person is off-line and I have to switch to a new person. They asking me weird questions like “were you talking with a real person or an automated system?” How would i know?? Its an awful experience. I can’t even get through to a provider. I’ve done the intake thing over and over.,Started my fist conversation and said I had been to therapy in the past, only to have the \"therapist\" ask: \"have you tried therapy in the past?\" \\nMaybe I\\'ll give the app another try down the line. Clearly some kinks need to be worked out. Considering the time we were all in, it was way too expensive. Not worth the money at all. I see a therapist via zoom for an hr and she only charges $75 and writes down notes for me. Way better than what talkspace offers,I have used a lot of apps. This app and service is really not great. My experience is that I signed up, filled out a form, was matched with a profiler, who then asked me to fill out another form ... and then another form ... and then another form and then was silent.  I am not sure of how the service actually works however I am deeply concerned that I made 4 attempts to engage, handed over a ton of very personal data and there has been absolutely no benefit from this.,I have been billed for two months. I turned off auto renew.  I have paid for 8 30 minute talk sessions. New sessions are very difficult to schedule and the existing sessions I had that I already paid for were auto cancelled when I turned off auto renew.   So I’ve paid 800 and only received one 30 minute session and can’t schedule more and customer support is  not understanding my issue or doesn’t care or intentionally misleading.,I have had this app for the past few weeks and have rotated through unresponsive, likely overworked therapist. There is virtually no support information or response if anything goes wrong whatsoever. The application and service are highly expensive yet in the past few weeks I have been completely and utterly unable to reach, communicate, or contact even one individual therapist or support member. This app is a travesty. Do not use money for this.,So far I have loved the experience for both myself and my daughter. The fact we can message everyday is very helpful and the video sessions are great as well. LLLoving it so far!,All begins well in the process, but even that includes canned generic responses mixed in with anything personal. Then along the way a day is skipped then two or three days and maybe you get a messages like I will respond by end of day and two days later you are still waiting. By the end of the week you have gotten one good response if you are lucky. I am disappointed. Maybe others have better luck. I did not.,I can’t’ speak for the other text therapy apps out there but Talkspace IS NOT IT. \\n\\nThe Good: \\n- It’s on demand\\n- It’s easy to use (you can reply about how you’re feeling at any time like you’re texting to a friend) \\n- good rates for 6 months of “1 text message a day” \\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- You can only view your therapist matches *ONCE* before they are gone forever. \\n- If you don’t choose a therapist and stick with them forever you’ll be relegated to the “At this time we do not/may not have another match readily available...”\\n- therapist profile stated over 20+ years of experience but they could only suggest journaling as a way to heal. \\n- My net utility would have been higher spending they money on 6 months of this therapy on hobby/sports equipment instead.,The doctors reply maybe once or twice a day and it’s very generic. It’s not frequent enough to be helpful in my opinion.\\n\\nThe service is not cheap either - I was forced to buy 1 month upfront which $236 including insurance and discounts. It would be over $300 monthly thereafter. \\n\\nThe app itself and the idea itself is great — but the slow replies or no replies from the doctors is what kills this service. I am extremely disappointed.,They are all too busy so you might get 3 minutes of their time each day or every other day. It seems as if a lot of what they say are just copy & paste. So they aren’t really dealing with YOUR issue or helping YOUR issue. My “therapist” sent me the same thing copied and pasted on separate days, so yes I know it’s all just copy & paste and move on to the next person. My first time talking to a therapist and I’m a little annoyed I spent over $100 on this.,I’ve updated my app and yet nearly every end point is dead? Can’t view subscription info, error when trying to access plan info, content doesn’t load when you first open the app, I have to use a web browser to make any settings updates and then they aren’t live in the app. Really killing the whole convenient therapy vibe.,I don’t hate the app- I think it’s beneficial. But, I don’t like that it asks for your age. I do not think that your age should be asked. Perhaps it’s just a personal feeling, but I do not like giving out my age. It’s personal. For the name thing, you can just use a random name, but I do not like the age thing. Just a personal opinion, feel free to agree or disagree.,Few therapists are available. Pointless to provide your preferences, matching results will be very limited and disappointing. They said they don’t have available therapists at this moment. Their customer service is surprisingly unhelpful. I wanted to like this app and super excited to try it out, but it turned out that it’s a big waste of time and it did add even more stress. Do not waste your time on this service.,As someone who struggles with bipolar disorder, I was looking forward to trying this out. My first therapist wasn’t a fit so I reached out to customer service to find a new one. They have been COMPLETELY unresponsive. It’s been a week and I still haven’t heard from anyone.\\nI am struggling and feel totally abandoned by this service. If I was in a more precarious mental state it would have been too late. \\nI’ve cancelled my membership and will be demanding a refund.,They lure you in by offering a “generous discount” promising a back and forth with experienced therapists. I had the app for a week and received 3 responses from two different therapists over that period. When I contacted customer service, an automatic email was generated with quick links to cancellation and refunds. I guess a refund of $105 of the $140 is about the same price I’d pay for one session covered by insurance, but I still don’t think it’s worth it.,If you have any issues and need to contact customer service they don’t answer you for WEEKS between responses. The only way to contact customer service is via email. They have no phone number. I had an issue with billing and it was the most frustrating thing to get in contact with someone. I can’t wait to get refunded to use another platform.,I’ve never felt so low before and needed help. I finally reached out and the therapist has only messaged me 3 times in 48 hours. None of which are even talking about what I explained was going on to make me feel so low. I even took a depression and anxiety test that was provided from the therapist, scored severe in both categories and have yet to hear anything about those from her. Now I’m struggling to get back my money. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,If you want help, look somewhere else.  If you choose this application you will end up with therapists that do not respond and/or do not care.  I was in a bad place when I decided to try this application and I am in a worse place afterward.  For a company that advertises a place where you can talk to a therapist, they do a terrible job providing therapists that will actually talk with you.,There should be a way to filter therapists based on the type of therapy they do. I.e., if they are okay with messages only because that is the subscription I\\'m on. After dumping 200$, I have still yet to receive any therapy due to therapists being only available for video sessions and not being open to therapy through messages. Waste of time and money, since I couldn\\'t even get a full refund.,Do not use this app. I paid over $600 because I was so determined to get help for my awful mental health AND NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM A THERAPIST!! I even waited two whole days AND switched therapists because I thought maybe one was too overwhelmed and couldn’t respond? But nope the other “therapist” never responded either. In the process of trying to get a refund and I can’t even get a response from this company. Don’t waste your hard earned money on this scam of an app.,I had really high hopes for this app being a better therapy app that I could use as it provided a use of insurance option but I’ve tried talking to 2 therapists so far and neither have responded to me. I’ve been waiting 3 days for a response after signing and nothing. How am I supposed to set up instant messaging if my therapist would even respond? I am LESS than disheartened by this app and completely dissatisfied.,Talkspace is a good idea. However, at least in my experience, the therapists are not helpful nor caring. They signed up for this but don’t do their jobs. Perhaps they should stick to their day jobs at their own practice or whatever else they do because clearly they don’t have time to respond something meaningful or insightful, that is if they respond at all.,First off. It took me 10 minutes just to give a good password because it says my password was too weak. Just try adding Sign In with Apple or something like that. \\n\\nSecond. As a user. I want to easily be able to open the app and schedule a session. I still don’t know how to do that. This looks like a good app but you guys are just making it more difficult that it is.,I’ve been a Talkspace user for years and dealing with their customer support is horrible. It takes forever to get a reply and when they do reply, the agent doesn’t even read and understand what you’re asking about. They could be great if their customer service was above abysmal quality.,I signed up for a month, the first therapist responded to me and then sent me a plethora of information that it was overwhelming. She said I should be speaking 90% of the conversation. So I decided to switch therapists well the next one only responded to the intro and then not again after I sent 3 messages over 2 weeks!! Hate that I wasted my money on this! I was really hoping this would be a good option but it was not!!,Had high hopes for some more convenient talk therapy. Didn’t even get past the counselor who was supposed to match me with an actual counselor. We were messaging, she went offline and I haven’t heard back from her in a few days. I guess dependability isn’t in their qualifications.  Hopefully, other people who are seeking help have a better experience!,I acknowledge that the therapist have their in person clientele. However, for this to be a mobile service there’s no reason why i should be waiting DAYS before getting a response. There’s no reason i should be getting an email from the system canceling a session because a counselor didn’t respond. I spent money just to never receive any service. I am disgusted and convinced this isn’t to help at all.,I love that I don’t have to wait an entire week or more to speak with my therapist and get things off my chest. They couldn’t have paired me so far with a better therapist. She is exactly what I need.,Although I think resources like this are needed, I feel that Talkspace clearly has their own agenda and looking to capitalize on this segment of the medical field. They advertise that they accept insurance but then the resources for those using insurance are limited. I was really hoping this would be a great option.,The two therapists I signed up for either didn’t communicate by the time Talkspace said they would, and the second therapist was off starting the next day for 5 days. I got discouraged by the service and am trying to cancel my subscription for either a full or partial refund. Customer Service simply won’t respond to my request. Only an automated reply. Wild.,I signed up for one month of services and a week in no one has replied to me either for therapy or for customer service to refund my payment since I’m receiving no services. Think twice before you sign up.  The app itself performs fine, but there is no one on the other side of the app to provide the services they claim to offer.,I signed up and could not even use the features paid for since the therapists are so overworked. My complimentary live video session will never be used because my therapist (and others I’ve tried) have zero openings for multiple weeks. \\nIf you look up employee reviews on Glassdoor and such you can see that the person meant to be caring for your mental health is overworked and underpaid.,You would think that since they are dealing with your mental health that they would respond in a timely manner but no. Neither my therapist nor the customer service team got back to me for five days. It wasn’t until I reached out to their customer support via Twitter that I got a reply. I needed therapist to talk to immediately and I never got to talk to someone at all. Don’t waste your money on this.,The concept is really cool but when it comes down to it you’re paying some really good money to speak to somebody and you’re not getting a response I feel like if you really think you need therapy it’s probably best that you go in person because you get the time and attention you need,It’s impossible to delete this app on your own. You have to contact customer service... but wait, even after you convince them to delete you.. they will continue sending you emails with  an “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of these emails that... DOESN\\'T WORK. It’s fake. So they will continue sending you emails FOREVER. ..... I am so sick of them.,A terrible scam!! They want you to pay even if you don’t talk to a therapist! The therapist they gave me cancelled every session I tried to book and then they tried to charge me for more time so I can book another session and wouldn’t give me another therapist even though he would not talk to me! HORRIBLE SCAM! If you need help I suggest going somewhere else cause they won’t help you it’s all about the cash flow!,I signed up for a subscription that included video engagement with the counselor. The counselor they connected me with had no available video appointments. I reached out to customer service and got no response. I requested a refund and was sent to a refund wizard that said I wasn’t eligible for refund. I am out several hundred dollars after buying a subscription that wasn’t what it purported to be.,I could not be more disappointed than I am with this. I really had high hopes for this but I went through multiple therapists and nobody timely responded and when I asked for a refund or a new therapist I was basically told to go pound sand. I have unused sessions that I paid for and they refuse to provide services because I complained about timelines of responses.,I signed up for a couples therapy subscription and after being matched with a therapist, I was told he would reach out to us within 24 hours. We waited 11 days with no response from him. When we asked customer support to help us find a new provider, they didn’t have any and refused to take ownership for their unresponsive provider.,I don’t usually do reviews, however don’t waste money needlessly. It’s almost impossible to time when you will receive a response and since it’s expensive I would have expected a better turn around time. The whole experience was off somehow.,After almost two weeks, I’m still waiting to start my ‘journey’ with this company. \\n\\nUnacceptable delays from both matching therapists and my actual therapist has been completely silent, missing response deadlines constantly. \\n\\nI have no evidence that there is actually a therapist at the other end of the message thread, because I’ve literally never heard from them. \\n\\nCustomer service is also silent. But of course, the credit card charges go through without delay! \\n\\nI know it’s a busy time in the industry, but my experience is that this company is unable to live up to its commitments to clients.,Apparently the scheduling app doesn’t work well for therapists so they don’t use it and scheduling the sessions you paid for is quite difficult. A journaling app would be about as helpful. Bummed I spent over $1000 for 3 months of service and made zero progress because I couldn’t get actual appointments.,I’ve never done this before and I met my therapist today for the first time. Sere is awesome!!  Her personality is perfect and I know she will be easy to talk to. Wish I had done this sooner.,Paid $260 to try and get set up. My therapist cancelled on me twice. Tried to get in touch with customer service, didn’t hear back for a week. Really want a refund but as for therapy you might as well go to a canyon and throw money into it and scream your problems into the void. Completely terrible app and I honestly feel like they stole $260 from me,I wanted to give this a shot since I didn’t want to do Zoom therapy sessions, but it’s just not good. I didn’t feel like the “providers” (therapists) I spoke to really grasped what I was saying, it as more “I’m sorry you feel that way” and shoo’ing me on my way. It’s cheaper than regular therapy but I don’t think it’s worth it.,Depending on which matching person you get, your help varies.  Some want to show possible matches some just are in it to get you to sign up and commit.  It is very frustrating for someone who is a first timer to the process.,The customer service team says no to everything... this app is meant to help you but it’s really all about taking your money. The one star is purely for the lovely person I’m seeking counsel from, otherwise this is too expensive for overall value offered.,I met the most helpful therapist on this app. After one video session I feel so much better. Highly recommend,Maybe my expectations were to high. I started this process on Sunday night. Took 4 hours to match me with a therapist. Started the intake process this am at 0:930. Was first unable to get acknowledgment that text was received. Over an hour later I got a text I would hear from her by 8 pm tonight. I was really hoping this could work for me.,Signed up my teenage daughter to get help during the pandemic. Therapist took up to 24 hours to reply via text and didn’t at all connect with her. Kids need a way quicker reply time. By the time we figured out it wasn’t working and she wasn’t using it we had been charged $455.  Joke.,This is super convenient and my therapist just understood me in the best way possible. I explained things to me in a language I understood. I recommend this app to everyone.,It’s kind of magical to download this app and meet with an incredible therapist in under a week. This is something special here.,I paid $160 as a discount for me first month. 1 month = 4 weeks. The “therapist” did not even begin any treatments with me until the 2nd week which would mean I am only getting 3 weeks rather then the 4 that I paid for. My therapist asked me when I will see a therapist. Service is an absolute joke!,Unfortunately, this app is advertised for “everyone” but in reality is quite expensive for services so it’s really not for everyone. If you have money, great this app may be helpful. If you don’t, then I wouldn’t waste your time downloading. I was so excited when I first heard about, but was sorely disappointed.,If you’re a person with limited means then this app is not for you. $300 month is attracting a certain clientele and, going off that price point, it’s not anyone with any true issues. So, I’d you’re a rich and (primarily) White person with unlimited means and no real problems, then this app is for you Becky, Karen, Paul, and Brett.,This app seems useful if you have “normal” mental health issues to deal with (anxiety, depression, etc.) but I tried 3 different therapists and who all claimed to specialize in chronic pain and none were at all prepared. I’m pretty bummed that I spent upwards of $200 just to strike out three times. On the upside, it is pretty easy to switch providers.,Signed up for Talkspace 2 weeks ago. Dropped the first counselor for not responding for over a week, new one gave an intro message, but no response after. Definitely not worth the price, and I decided to save money by paying for 6 months. Feeling scammed and hopeless, which surprisingly, is bad for mental health, especially in a crisis.,I signed up and was excited to try talkspace. Spent 2 hours signing up, taking quizzes and watching intro videos. Spent 1 hour writing my intro message to my therapist. No response. Requested a new therapist after several days... silence. Ended up cancelling and getting a refund. Disappointed, and this site needs lots of work!,I have been signed up for weeks now and still have not been able to get a therapist who can schedule any visits or respond regularly. This is a scam for 600 dollars, they do not care about you or apparently have the resources to take you on as a client. Look elsewhere.,These therapists are the new VA case managers, and I hate to see it. Glad I didn’t waste my hard earned money, just my employers, but this was a waste. Two months. Not a single response from multiple counselors. \\n\\nGive these therapists a reasonable amount of folks assigned to them, or give these folks back their money. Period.,It took my selected therapist nearly 24 hours to inform me she won’t be able to help me based on my issues. They definitely are upfront about the price but don’t tell you that your therapist will respond sporadically. Maybe paying out of pocket instead of using insurance will cause better treatment.,I’ve been trying to get help from a therapist for days on this app and the only replies are from bots. I paid too much, $340 for one month, to not be able to speak to an actual person let alone the fact that I do need help. It adds insult to my already difficult situation,The concept is great, but their therapists were not. If you want to waste time investing in talking to someone for weeks to have them insensitively dump you for no reason, then this might be for you. I told customer service ice my whole story, and they refunded me because they knew how wrong they were. This app is NOT the way to go.,I was paired with a therapist who wasn’t taking new clients.  The therapist told me to reach out to costumer service, which I did. I still haven’t heard back from them and I am struck in then process unable to get help or move on to a new therapist. I have sent 2 messages which still have no response,I love my counselor. Mental health is so important and under treated. This app makes it both steady and accessible for anyone to get the help they need.,150$ for ten minutes texting with your therapist each day and if you’re not online at same time as they are then you missed the chance to talk to them Bc they’re “busy with other patients”. For $150 I expect much more than that,Live sessions are great but I subscribed years ago when it wasn’t required and could reach out to my therapist via chat or text. Making live sessions required makes social phobiacs like myself not seek help. I reached out to customer service about this this and received no response.,They continue to take money even when they are not supposed to. The therapist is great but the service provider is terrible!! When you need to contact someone they don’t give you a phone number. You can email them which they never respond!!!,Even with my insurance, the cheapest rate is $45 a week. That’s ridiculous. The “free” session is just a bot that asks you a few questions then gives you the expensive plan options. Maybe it’s helpful if you’re rich, I don’t know. Poor people need therapy too, perhaps more.,Sad to say I signed up and reached out and scheduled an appointment a week in advance with a therapist whom never responded nor confirmed the appointment and it was canceled by the system. Then I set up another appointment with another provider and exact same outcome. I gave up. This is quite sad and very unprofessional.,My therapist did not show up for my first session and did not offer a reason as to why it was missed. I requested my money back from customer service. I did not receive a complete refund.,If you’re going to go out of pocket go somewhere else. The “therapists” could care less about you. I had such an awful experience after finally building up the courage to seek help. This company verified my theory that therapy is a giant scam. You’re better off suffering in silence than dealing with this app.,I may as well have flushed my money down the toilet. I got a very snarky response from the 1st therapist after pouring my heart out. The 2nd never engaged me. I have not been given a decent match in all my attempts. They kept matching me with people WHO ARE ON LEAVE. Save yourself the anxiety & headache. It just exacerbated my issues.,Signed up after being told repeatedly that the app would be a good fit, only to be matched with one therapist over and over again who wasn’t responsive, and despite not receiving any of what I paid for, a full refund was denied. What a let down.,im a teenager who is struggling and wanted to try to reach out because i have no way of coping except bad things and have no one to talk to, didnt realize it wasnt free and my parents dont understand what i going through so cant just ask them to pay. they did say to call hotlines but my parents can see all my calls and i just feel like i shouldnt call. im dealing with a lot right now and this isnt what i was hoping for,As excited as I was to try the app the let down was bad! The therapist I matched with never reached out and not it’s been the biggest mission to get my refund. Please save yourself and look for a therapist in your area this app is not worth it at all!,I really dont want to rate this low cause the therapists Ive seen are really good. The app itself has issues especially when using EAP codes. You want customer service good luck, I message and get ghosted. And of course no phone number to call,Majority if the therapists on the app have only a few years of experience. I you’re getting the subscription for free through work give it a try. Otherwise it’s very overpriced.,Therapists don’t respond, the therapist I got matched up with has no availability and their calendar was always “booked up, check again later.” Literally cannot get an appointment with someone but they are still happy to charge my money.\\n\\nAvoid.,Paid for a month subscription. Couldn’t not schedule an appointment for three weeks. On day and time of appointment my therapist did not reach out. Canceled subscription. Wish I could get my money back. Only advice from dr is to go to urgent care. Like really? For Anxiety? Thanks. But no that’s.,They are not there to help anyone. They want to bill your insurance company only. If you don’t have insurance, they lose interest in you very quickly, and will not even answer your questions. Truly horrible EVIL people.,I was able to sign up but no one ever contacts me. Not my assigned person, not support. I sent two requests and they were marked as solved, but no one contacted me or did anything to resolve the issue.,Really upsetting that you are forced to talk to someone before you find a therapist. Everything online said I would be able to find a therapist and choose on my own. It almost feels like an invasion of privacy to have someone else filter on your behalf.,I’m sure this app may help others but even with switching providers, responses are delayed. I understand it’s mentioned responses may be delayed right now and they have been. Based off of my own experience I can’t recommend this form of therapy.,Have been trying for two months to match with a female therapist and keep getting told there are none. I keep being presented the same five men every time I try. After awhile, I had my account deactivated due to inactivity. A great idea in theory but an absolutely useless app.,I read all the reviews but decided to give it a chance. Literally made an account about 5 hours ago. Didn’t even get a chance to speak about therapy yet because the “matching agent” hasn’t replied in 3 hours. I’m not putting money into this.,No matter what I do, I can’t create an account with a password that doesn’t need to be set. The password requires are higher than encrypted vaults but hey- that makes sense, right? Either way, no password sticks. Resetting leads to an endless resetting/locked out flow. \\n\\nSuper fun! Thanks everybody.,I think the idea of this app is great however, from my experience it falsely advertises communication with a therapist at least 5 days a week. That was not the case for me at all. I switched therapist a few times because I never got passed the initial conversation.,I got matched with a therapist that had no interest in helping me or replying to me. I tried to switch therapists and there was no one available and when I decided to go back to my original therapist she informs me she’s leaving the platform. Waste of time and money,This app may be perfect for you, but for those who struggle with depression and mental illness this app is not a good option.\\n\\nBasically, it entails texting between you and a provider. There are live sessions but they cost extra ON TOP of the subscription...\\n\\nI tried it for over a month. Not great.,I tried multiple passwords, all with 8 or more characters, an upper case, lowercase, numeric, and symbolic characters. It still kept saying my passwords were “weak” or “so-so” without telling me the criteria.\\n\\nI just deleted the app. I’ll used betterhelp instead, this app blew it.,The pricing is insane for what it offers and the time someone actually spends with you or answers back…. You’re better off going to see someone in person local.,Cool concept but had a poor experience compared to conventional therapy in the past. Therapist was unorganized plus rarely available, and app charged monthly Vs per session. Also my platinum PPO insurance barley covered any of the costs.,I was SO excited to try this. Unfortunately, I went through two therapist and neither one responded. Honestly a waste of time and money. In person therapy is expensive, but at least you’ll actually receive help.,No response from first therapist, waited for two days and switched back to another therapist and didn’t got response. Contacted support to cancel my subscription, but no timely response from support either.. I don’t recommend this app.,If you subscribe, the only way to apply insurance is through a second subscription.\\n\\nThey don’t use standard IAP; you have to given them your card, so you’re not protected by Apple’s normal App Store protections.\\n\\nIn order to cancel subscriptions you need to click through seven different “please don’t unsubscribe” screens.\\n\\nThey use weasly language, instead of “your insurance isn’t supported” it’s “you get a limited time discount!”\\n\\nI don’t recommend unless it’s your only option.,gave google advice every time. one just told me to go to the doctor every time I said something and when I switched providers again the last one didn’t even respond. waste of money,I really needed to start therapy, and they don’t have any providers available. It’s a joke. Is this even a service ? Don’t bother even trying to set it up. They can’t keep up with demand and just send you automated messages.,Pick a different telehealth app. \\n\\nThis one won’t tell you what will be covered by insurance, bill you without your insurance even getting claims, and not help you when you’re left with hundreds in medical bills.,I experienced a Revolving door of therapists.  None of them responded in a timely manner. most of them are not remotely interested in their jobs The questions were a single line and sometimes even just a couple of words,If I could zero stars I would. The therapists show as “working” but don’t respond, don’t show up for live sessions, and support never writes back. I basically paid almost $400 to fill out some surveys and received zero help, assistance, or support.,Thank God I found this app. I’m so grateful. Best healthcare experience to date!!,I tried to find a therapist, though I was matched with very few options, including a therapist that only provided pre-recorded and text therapy?  Huh?  Some of the providers did not seem highly qualified and not worth the money.,Loving Talkspace. Provides an options that are conducive to my fat to day life,I’m on Medicaid need help and we are in a pandemic, I was offered a discount but would still have to pay 35 to 65 a week? I’m not even working barely paying our bills and losing my mind and Medicaid won’t cover this? Ridiculous!!!,Terrible service, they do not have enough therapists. Complete waste of money and if you have a customer service issue you will not get a response. I’ll never believe another recommendation from Michael Phelps. This is a scam - run!,THIEVES...\\nI paid $400For nothing but text message! \\n\\nI made four separate appointments. I was one minute late for the first one. Three minutes early for the second one. 15 minutes early for the third one. And the fourth one I was a half hour early. I paid $400For nothing but text message!\\n\\n😡😱🥶now a month later after telling them I wanted them to never contact me again; they charged my account another $400🤢🤮Thieves!,After waiting over two weeks, I never got a response. Since I waited patiently for the response, by the time I gave up I wasn’t eligible for a full refund. Would not recommend to anyone.,I had a very annoying experience trying to sign in basically the keyboard blocks clicking the login button,There is no customer service. If your therapist stops responding you can’t find out why. If you have a billing problem , no one gets back to you. It is a nightmare for mental health patients.,Can you say awkward?.. Nothing about talking to the Matching Host was comfortable. Why inquire a person about why they’re reaching out and then not say anything for over 15 mins.. then follow that up with.. “I can tell you about our plans if you’d like..” SO AWKWARD,I don’t give a lot of reviews but this app is very hit or miss. I have a friend in TN receives good care from a very responsive provider but I’ve tried four providers over five who have been unresponsive or limited responses such as once a week,With the messaging plan, you get an uninterested therapist that answers twice a day. He wasted my time and money. 5 word responses, twice a day, don’t help. Especially when he would just ask questions.,Paid for a full month and never even got to talk to a provider. App blows highly dissatisfied and definitely would not recommend. Better off talking to a wall.,They advertise the app as free but in order to actually use it and get help you have to pay like $69 a week. I don’t have that extra money.

Waisted time.,waiting waiting and no provider reply.,I love the idea of this app but the cost outweighs the benefits, and I say this as someone who loved the therapist I matched with. Paying $260 MINIMUM per month is ridiculous when what you get is someone who essentially replies to your texts once a day, multiple times a day if you\\'re lucky, but usually only a handful of times per week. To my knowledge, there is no way to give ongoing feedback about the quality of your therapy to Talkspace--how often therapists miss their scheduled response should be displayed prominently somewhere!\\n\\nTalkspace gives away free sessions and discounts like candy, which I appreciated at first, but at some point it becomes obvious that if they can give away so much free stuff then they are just wildly overcharging everyone to begin with. \\n\\nAlso, half the features don\\'t work! On multiple occasions I was offered a free week or 50% off automatically in the app, but nothing happened after I accepted the prompt. My guess is that\\'s a coding/UI error, but it was incredibly frustrating to be constantly offered discounts that never materialized.\\n\\nBottom line is that this app is great if money is no object for you, and if you can tolerate therapy in bits and pieces over a long texting conversation (which I could not but that\\'s my personal preference) rather than 30-60 minute substantive conversations. The app does offer face to face conversations but that means paying $400 (!!!!!) per month or $65 per session on top of $260 for texting, unless they accept your insurance, which seems exceedingly rare.\\n\\nYou can get more for less on many other platforms.,SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM \\n\\nCHARGED MY CARD FOR 260$ didn’t receive any email confirmation nor receipt.\\n\\nReached out to customer service they said i do not have an account But talkspace card charged \\n\\nI want a refund!!,They do not respond to you.,I had nothing but great things to say about talkspace and my therapist of nearly 2 years, up until recently... now, I would recommend that everyone stay AWAY from this service and this company, who doesn’t seem truly invested in mental well-being at all. \\n\\nWithout warning, without indication she was taking time away, my therapist stopped responding to messages, there was no formal termination of care, and I haven’t been able to get ahold of her for 3 months now. I can see that she has “read” texts I’ve sent, but they go unanswered. She literally just ghosted on me. I am mentally vulnerable and was dealing with a lot during the Covid pandemic, self isolating for over 400 days due to being high risk. Talkspace doesn’t provide you with any sort of recourse for a situation like this. To make matters worse, there are apparently “no records” covering my care from my therapist, so if I wanted to change providers (inside OR outside of talkspace), I’m going to have to start from literally ground zero. Over 2 years of therapy on talkspace is over $5,000 worth of time that I have spent working on many topics with my therapist, and talkspace is not doing much to help me get my records (which are legally my property). This company treats mental health patients as if they are using a service like Uber. They don’t hold themselves accountable when things go wrong. I’m constantly told how my “concerns are being escalated” but nothing changes. Now, after being abandoned by a provider I trusted and worked with for 2 YEARS, I am afraid to trust another provider. It will take me months, if not years to recover from the trauma of being abandoned by my therapist when I really needed her. Talkspace offers me no solutions of how I can get my records or what I can do. There’s no consequence for the abandonment and I had to fight to get money back for the weeks I went without therapy. \\nI’m disappointed— the concept could’ve been great, but clearly there is no protection for patients being really hurt when a therapist on talkspace fails to uphold their professional duty and obligations.\\n\\nI’m wholeheartedly disappointed and thoroughly traumatized by this very lonely experience,I’ve never left a review for an app/service before, but I felt compelled to do so with TalkSpace because I fear that they are taking advantage of people’s mental health issues, especially amidst everything going on with COVID. \\n\\nI love the idea of Talkspace and think it could have been a perfect tool for me. Unfortunately, my first two providers took days to reply to my simple messages, and when they did finally reply, I was usually given an unhelpful and generic sentence or two. My first provider asked me what had and hadn’t worked in the past for me in therapy, and I said I didn’t care for worksheets. So she sent me…worksheets, ones that I could have easily found on the Internet on my own. And my second provider took so long to respond to messages that TalkSpace offered me additional free weeks of service. Seeing as the app has an immediate option to offer this kind of thing, I’m guessing they’re used to people complaining about providers taking so long. \\n\\nAfter my first provider abruptly left TalkSpace and my second provider stopped responding altogether, I found someone who I actually connected with. She said she was training to become a full-time employee of TalkSpace and I was excited to have more time with her. What I didn\\'t know was that if I wanted to have that time with her beyond a quick message here and there, I had to pay $65 for a 30-minute video session on top of the monthly fee I already pay. Needless to say, I wasn’t going to do that. I\\'m not paying $200+ a month to get a one-sentence message every other day, and I\\'m certainly not going to pay more for a video session knowing that the quality of service will likely be lacking (if the rest of TalkSpace is any indication). \\n\\nI find it noble that TalkSpace wants to make therapy more accessible to more people, but I\\'m starting to wonder how much of that is just a facade to get people to cough up more money for a lackluster service. If you’re considering using TalkSpace, please know what you’re paying for. It is not traditional therapy, but rather a sporadic message here or there, with some generic worksheets tacked on. If you’re willing to pay for the video sessions, your experience may be better than mine. But this isn’t how you share therapy with the masses.,I signed up for Talkspace in the beginning of January thinking Telehealth might be my best option. I quickly realized its not for me. I paid for the 6 month service to save money. If I signed up for a bulk of months, I saved like 30%. The total cost for 24/7 chat thread, 4 video chats a month and unlimited voicemail services for 6 months was $1896. \\n\\nThey set you up with a matching agent to find out what kind of provider you\\'re looking for. Great. \\n\\nThe first provider I matched with ignored me for days and wouldn\\'t confirm any of the video chat appointments I scheduled (and paid for with my package) which ultimately led to them being canceled at the last minute. I decided she didn\\'t work for what I needed so the matching agent started to match me with other therapists. \\n\\nShe matched me with therapists that had no available appointments, dealt with mainly pediatric patients, or their language was Spanish which I don\\'t speak. It was added stress when I was looking to speak to someone about the stress I already had. I grew frustrated. \\n\\nThe next provider I thought I successfully matched with was super attentive, but was really reluctant to video chat with me even though it was a service I paid for. Every time I scheduled a video chat, she asked me if it was \"really necessary\" or if I would prefer a phone call instead. When I finally got her to video chat with me, I was left with a frozen screen on her side showing a wall and the tippy top of her forehead for the entire 45 minutes. The things she talked during the video chat where strange and not \"therapist-y\" at all. She started to talk about HER prolems. She was almost childish in the way she spoke. I didn\\'t feel like she was taking me seriously and there was something... off... about her speech. I ended the video chat feeling anxious, blamed and ridiculous. Like I offered her more advice than she offered me. I threw her name into a simple google search and found out she has severe mental disabilities. Im not even entirely sure she\\'s qualified for a therapist position because I could find very little on her education experiences. I only found articles from when her and her family were interviewed about her disabilities. \\n\\nI decided I didn\\'t want to waste any more time searching for a therapist with this service who has provided me with nothing but more stress and aggravation. So I canceled my subscription and asked for a refund. They canceled my membership and immediately told me they were sending me a refund for $1882. It was $14 less than I paid but I figured that was fine since that\\'s about what I would pay for the janky services I received.\\n\\nA week went by and I checked my account to make sure the refund went through. Thats when I found out that it did, but they also charged me again. $276 came out of my account and I emailed to ask why. Their website provides NO PHONE NUMBER to contact an actual human. A few days went by with no response so I emailed AGAIN.... no response. \\n\\nJust this weekend I get an email saying \"Thank you for your purchase.\" They charged me an ADDITIONAL $396 and told me my next payment will be taken on March 14th. \\n\\nSo during this past month when I have had NO SUBSCRIPTION with their service, they have charged me $672 total. \\n\\nI have emailed multiple times with no response. I signed on to my Talkspace page and it clearly states I have no subscription and that I canceled on January 19th. I tried to remove my CC information they have stored and it wouldn\\'t let me. I tried to enter false cc information thinking it wouldn\\'t go through the next time they tried to charge me and they would then, of course, try and contact me.... but it wouldn\\'t let me do that either. \\n\\nI put my FBI cap on. Since there\\'s no phone number anywhere on their website, I googled their physical address. Then I googled the phone number for that address. I called it and it was an automated Talkspace voicemail machine. I left a message and still no response. \\n\\nThats when I decided to make this post. I tried to be an adult about this, but lately companies only seem to respond when they\\'re publicly bashed on the internet. \\n\\nIm not normally a Karen, but Im prepared to go full Karen over the $672 Talkspace owes me. Thats a lot of money that we\\'ve been robbed of. I also want my cc information deleted from their program so this can not happen again. \\n\\nI would love a response to my emails or voicemails asap. \\n\\nWorst case scenario... their physical address is right here in NYC. I can always just show up.,I signed up for Talkspace and tried to get a therapist. First of all, they make you talk to something called a “Matching Agent” who isn’t the therapist. They talk to you about “What brings you to Talkspace?” This is completely wrong because it’s not the therapist. I was kind of tricked into opening up to this person. \\n\\nRates are really bad. \\n$65/week for JUST TEXTING. \\n$260/month for JUST TEXTING. Oh, and a free 10 minute video session. I didn’t even look beyond this price point. \\n\\nWent with the $260. \\n\\nThen I picked “my” therapist. I typed to her and typed and typed. She never responded. Talkspace’s response to the FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION of “Why isn’t my therapist answering?”  was a pithy article about how “therapists are humans too” and they’ve got a lot of work to do, or something. I wish I could tell my boss that! \\n\\nInstead of an actual solution,  Talkspace offers TWO options: 1) wait for a reply or 2) choose a different therapist. \\n(Then what the was all that “matching” for?)\\nI decided that I had spent WAY too much money to be ignored and wanted my money back. I submitted a request ticket stating that I hadn’t even gotten to use the services and I wanted my money back. They completely ignored my first service request. I ended up submitting 3 more service requests. Still ignored.  \\n\\nThen, I went on Twitter. The ONLY WAY to get their attention was to get on Twitter and publicly decry them for stealing. I got a DM from whomever was running the Twitter and THEN AND ONLY THEN was I able to get my money back. I still haven’t actually gotten it back, it’s going to take 2-5 business days. \\n\\nSuffice it to say, they’re taking advantage of depressed people during a pandemic. The matching specialist never even offered up the fact that they accept insurance until AFTER  you’ve already paid the money. Then, if you want to add your insurance card, that technically starts another “account”, and both accounts will remain open AND auto renew unless you fix it and close the first one. It’s money. Money money money. Don’t use it. Spend the time searching for a REAL therapist that is covered by your insurance.,I was thoroughly disappointed - I thought this would be perfect for me with a busy and irregular schedule. The one live session I scheduled was canceled by talk space because the therapist never confirmed it.\\n\\nThe few responses I did get from the therapist were so boiler plate generic that I\\'m positive everyone gets exactly the same response. I felt like the after thought obligation of someone trying to \"get their work done\" while running out the door to a party. I sent very thorough messages, waited a long time for a response, then the response was generic, so I elaborated even more and waited again for another generic response. Really no \"therapy\" happening. You could achieve the same therapeutic benefit by just writing in a journal - the responses you get will be just as useful. \\n\\nI set up therapy through a local clinic that offers in person or telemedicine. They take my insurance unlike Talkspace, scheduling is easy, and they do therapy live over face time. For the same $260 per month, I could literally have 26 hours of LIVE sessions with a highly trained therapist over face time, due to insurance copay. You\\'d be surprised how many places are offering similar telemedicine these days. Talk space live session is very short, and I can\\'t speak to how effective it is since my session got canceled. The talk space model is not necessary any more, since most clinics are offering telemedicine due to covid. \\n\\nTalkspace only issued a partial refund after I had the service for less than 3 days, literally 4 very generic responses from the therapist, 1 canceled live session, and not responding to my support ticket for multiple days. I sent support an email and got an automatic response which thankfully had instructions for canceling and requesting a refund. Unfortunately the refund is calculated pro rata automatically and I\\'m waiting for a response from a human being. As of this moment, I\\'m still out $35. I\\'m so tired of these companies that make it really easy to spend money, and really difficult to get it back if you\\'re not satisfied.\\n\\nHopefully you will find a better experience. For me, it only served to increase the anxiety that I was hoping to relieve.,My regular therapist is on maternity leave for 3 months so I wanted to give this app a try to hold me over until she is back. I was also really interested in seeing if the model might actually work better for me in the long term, and was willing to try the plan with weekly video chats as well as 24/7 messaging. Unfortunately I have not even been able to get signed up. \\n\\nWhen I created an account, I figured I’d be taken to a page where they would want to gather info about me and then offer me a plan to sign up for, then match me with a therapist. Nope. It just took me to a generic landing page with zero instruction. It took me a bit to figure out there was a message from someone who said she would guide me through the intake process. Ok, great! She asked to start with my name and age which I gave her, then she says “hi how can I help”. I let her know I just wanted to get started with the app and she gave me pricing and then asked what prompted me to seek therapy. I responded, then heard nothing back. Later that night I checked in to see if there was anything else we needed to do for this “intake process” she mentioned. No response. This morning, another check in - anything else to get started? No response. \\n\\nI do see in the app there is a place to sign up for a membership but why would I want to do that if I can’t even get a response on the intake process? \\n\\nI’m bummed I couldn’t even get signed up and am going to move on to exploring one of the other apps.,I signed up for Talkspace at the beginning of November of 2020 after realizing I needed to seek counseling for my general anxiety and severe insecurity and social anxiety. Like most people who struggle with these things, particularly social anxiety, it took a great deal of courage to take the step to get help, especially because I had never been through therapy before due to cost and extreme hesitancy to reach out for professional help. This is something I mentioned repeatedly to my therapist and the matching representative throughout my brief time with Talkspace. \\n\\nI was assigned to a therapist named Lisa within a day or two of signing up with Talkspace. I was very open with my deep sense of imposter syndrome and social anxiety and though I wasn’t in immediate peril, it was really important for me to talk to someone so I could regain control of my life. It was going fine until I received a notification that my therapist would be on vacation until the end of December. At this point, it was around November 8, and I’d used Talkspace for less than a week. Neither Lisa nor Talkspace gave me any prior notification that she would be gone or gave me a substitute—or, assigned me to a therapist who didn’t have a month and a half vacation planned. Instead, the automated notification in my chat with Lisa said I was encouraged to keep sending messages to her so I could write down my feelings and she’d get back to me when she returned from vacation. Yes, Talkspace expected me to continue paying the fee for a MONTH AND A HALF while I message myself in an echo chamber. Especially as a person who struggles with self image and feeling valued by others—which, again, I made very clear to everyone at Talkspace I talked with—this was a massive blow and completely undid what little therapy Lisa had provided me. \\n\\nI emailed Talkspace explaining the situation in detail, how horrible it made me feel, how irresponsible both Talkspace and Lisa were, and asking for a refund. I received a very sterile automated response telling me to fill out a form so I could get my refund, and everything I had written about my displeasure with my experience fell completely on deaf ears. I felt so insignificant, which was intensified by the fact that it was a therapy service that supposedly made counseling affordable, accessible, and empowering. It did none of those things for me. \\n\\nI had very high hopes for Talkspace and thought I was doing myself good by accepting that I needed help, but all I received in return was invalidation and a complete distrust of therapy.,THIS APP IS THE ISH! 5 MICS,This is a scam!,Eeee,Signed up under a promo code, but usually it costs about 400 a month for one weekly half hour session and daily texting. It’s not that afford or great of a deal.\\n\\nThe daily texting is pretty useless. You get one response back a day from therapist and all the responses I got back we’re pretty useless. Usually just “how did that make you feel” sorta responses, didn’t add much value.\\n\\nMy therapist also cancelled our scheduled appointment twice so I never even really got to book a session with him for our first month.\\n\\nHe was in the hospital apparently but talkspace wouldn’t refund me any of the month except prorated of what was left despite never even really getting any value out of the service.\\n\\nOverall I wouldn’t say it’s very useful or affordable. The daily messaging is somewhat useless and 400 dollars for 2 hours of phone time isn’t exactly cheap etc.\\n\\nThis might work for some people but for me the value just wasn’t there.,I start off by saying that initially signing up for TalkSpace I encountered numerous issues, one of them was able to resolve the issue and connect me with a provider that I genuinely liked talking with but out of no where, my coverage of using TalkSpace was gone when I had initially put the information in. I have Cigna and have already talked with them and they had told me that I was covered for TalkSpace. When I brought up the issue with the customer support, they took more than 5 days to reply to my issue at hand and suggested the same solution that I had already tried and didn’t work. I have put in at least 3 tickets dealing with the same issue and the customer support person was the same and told me the same thing. This has been going on for about a month now and I am fed up with it. There is no other form of communication other than emailing them and that doesn’t work. They need a customer support line as this is absolutely ridiculous that I am not able to get a manager or anyone other than the same tech person to help me resolve this problem. Not to mention that I am not able to set up a video session with my provider as the system does not appear to connect me with my provider. If I could I would’ve given it less stars as the system and app do not match with the service being provided. These are people that are dealing with mental health issues and shouldn’t have to be stressed out over not being able to talk with their therapist as they are paying for a service provided. This is what the tech support sent me on multiple times even after I informed the person that the he’s solution did not work. Hi there, Thank you for your follow-up! My apologies for the repeated issues here. At this time, it does not look like your insurance information was connected to this account. To re-apply your coverage to your existing account please follow the steps below: 1. Log in to your account on the web. 2. Click on your username 3. Select \"Check my coverage\" Once you receive this survey and click \"Get Started\", enter in your employer. We will check your eligibility for Talkspace and walk you through the process of getting started through your coverage. If you have any trouble matching with your original provider I can assist with switching you over, but please be sure to select a therapist at the end of the process regardless to finish making your new room. Once you have made a new room that includes your coverage, let me know and we can proceed with closing the invalid room. Let me know if you have any questions or need any assistance with this process. At your service, Patrick Talkspace Support,I’ve been trying to get my anxiety under control yet no one will message me back. It happens on Talkspace and happens in real life too. No one takes my calls or returns my call after voicemails. Looks like I’m on my own,THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM. I requested for them to cancel my account on February 5th and asked if I could get a refund for the first months service (260 dollars) which I signed up for on February 1st. The one therapy provider who got in touch with me was a no show and sent me a total of two messages trying to schedule a time we could talk (she never showed up for the time we arranged). I requested another therapy provider who also never got in touch. So ultimately in February I was charged 260 dollars for NO THERAPEUTIC help whatsoever. \\n\\nCustomer service cancelled my TICKET for customer service, where I asked that they cancel my account and if possible provide a refund. It’s now March 1st and I see another charge for 260 dollars. \\n\\nSo they have altogether stolen 520 dollars for me. Not to mention, throughout my subscription I got ZERO THERAPEUTIC HELP. I was unable to talk to a SINGLE PERSON/THERAPIST. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and find a real therapist through headway.co, which is ultimately what I ended up having to do. They can pair you with a provider who actually takes your insurance so that the charge is just for the copay.  My dad just died of COVID and I had to talk with someone, which this app fully never did. \\n\\nThis app capitalizes off of people in mental health crisis without ever offering any actual help.,I was excited to see that Talkspace “accepts insurance”.\\n\\nTo find out ANY details about cost (it’s $260/mo for basic text therapy, FYI) I had to go through a lengthy signup where they go so far as to “assign a therapist”. \\n\\nAnd then the insurance? It’s a scam. It’s basically a promo code for the first month.\\n\\nEven if Talkspace were the best therapy app out there, I personally wouldn’t use it because I find this to be strikingly lacking in honesty and transparency. Bad branding, terrible ui for a prospect.,Zero customer service.,DOUBLE AND TRIPLE YOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE BEFORE GIVING THEM A DIME.  I paid $316 for my first month of therapy before my insurance became active. I absolutely loved the therapist that I was matched with. I put my insurance information in a few days before it became active, just to see if I would be covered, and was redirected to a screen that said, with my insurance, I could continue for $40 per week. Only for my card to be automatically charged $316 on 01/01/2021, the day my insurance became active. The day my insurance became active, I paid another $196 for the month, believing that my insurance was covering the rest. I messaged customer support asking for a refund of the $316 since my insurance was now active and had just paid an additional $196 for, what I believed to be the out of pocket cost with my insurance. Customer support replied that they are not, in fact, in network with my insurance, and that it was a “one time discount” advertised after just checking for insurance benefits. I am more than disappointed that I cannot continue with my therapist on this app because she was amazing. But also cannot believe I ever gave a penny of my money to this money hungry, misleading app that conned me out of almost $900 for 2 months. I recommended this app to many friends, but will definitely be retracting my recommendations and advise everyone to stay away, unless you want to be conned out of your money.,You know it’s expensive when it hard to find pricing and easy to “sign up” first. \\n\\nAt this price you could get much better help from someone you can see in person. No offense to the professionals but you will also not be getting the same level of service. These are folks that are new or don’t have an established practice and client base. Again, nothing personal and everyone must start somewhere or grow their business somehow. I just don’t want to pay twice as much for lesser service, especially without an additional benefit. \\n\\nI was really hoping this would be an affordable option for the masses but at this price, I don’t know anyone that could afford it that wouldn’t just get help locally.,I love everything about this app itself. As an American, I seriously love the Australian accents featured in each meditation. And I immensely appreciate the services being offered for free. However, I do have one (and only one) complaint and that would be that my app crashes - quite literally - every time that I try to open it from the notification screen. By that, I mean that whenever I receive a “you have not meditated in ___ days, click here to do your next meditation” or a “it is time for your daily meditation” notification and I click on the given notification to open the Smiling Mind app, the app crashes and takes my phone back to its home screen every time. If this slight bug could be addressed, I’d absolutely change my rating to a 5-star and be happy to do, and I’d officially have no complaints left. Regardless, thank you for a great app and I am a big fan of it!,Having just started medical school in the US this past year, I became stressed out and started taking a negative outlook on life. I was also not treating those closest to me with the respect and love they deserved. After breaking up with my girlfriend, I decided to actually give myself time to meditate and reflect each day on who I was and how I could change. Doing Smiling Mind meditations regularly has made me more mindful of my emotions and how I don’t have to react to them immediately. I’ve also enjoyed the sleep meditations because the soothing Australian accents usually knock me out before the recording is even over. Thank you guys for making this app and making it free and available for everyone,I have been using Smiling Mind for about a month now and it is amazing!! It is the first completely free meditation/mindfulness app that I have found and it is very well put together. There are different sections based on who is meditating and there are so many different sections. I have done the Intro and am now doing the foundations course. This app has really allowed me to learn how to practice and incorporate mindfulness into my life even when I feel too busy to sit down and pull out the app. I think that this app is perfect for anyone who is interested in mindfulness/meditation, but doesn’t want to pay a lot like most of the other popular meditation apps!,This is the best mental health/check in app I’ve ever come across. I was so tired of mediation apps bombarding me with ads and the pressure to pay more for better services (it’s like.. the last thing I need when I’m trying to relax...) But Smiling Mind truly makes me feel like the people who created it actually care about the practice of mediation and not about making a buck. I find the directions to be clear and grounding, and I appreciate the wide variety of lessons and tips—they even have a series dedicated to relieving stress during quarantine. I highly recommend this app if you struggle with anxiety and/or depression!,Really solid range of meditations, including developmental tools to get started with little commitment and to gradually see the benefits.  It’s been part of my routine for years.\\n\\nNew app has some nice enhancements and the usual bugs with a major upgrade (won’t let me change voice gender at the moment) but the apps track record on fixing such things is good.  Stick with it.  The benefits are worth the investment.,I\\'ve used this app for a while. The content was always great the but layout/design was a bit confusing and overwhelming. Not anymore. I opened the app recently dkr the first time in a couple weeks and was excited to see a whole new design. It\\'s a huge improvement and much easier to use. I feel like this is now on par with the big paid apps like Headspace or Calm.,I was always in disarray until I have this a try. I’ve always had trouble sleeping but this has specific meditations that get me right to it. Listening to one of these can change my whole day for the better. So easy to use and approachable. The one thing is I’m always told to “find a seat” and all that but I rarely do just out of personal preference.,The best meditation app that exists on the market today. I cannot express enough gratitude for the team behind this life changing app. The sleep meditations have really helped me through my sleep issues and I cannot imagine my life without this app. All the guided meditations are amazing, especially the one titled ‘oceans’. Highly recommend, 5 stars!!,this app has a minimalistic design and i love how it looks and how to navigate the app. it is amazing how it’s literally FREE. like, completely! there’s no ads either! the one thing i don’t like is that the exercises are a bit repetitive. what i mean is there is one exercise, for example the belly breathing with the bubble, it repeats about 7 times over and over again. thanks for reading and i hope you have a great day! 😊,I have been using Smiling Mind for a couple of years already. I have seen big benefits from using it daily and on particular occasions. The big advantage is that the app is free and has a lot of meditations available for different age groups or profiles. \\nDefinitely recommending it to any person wishing to improve their wellbeing.,Hi, when I first downloaded the app there was very limited meditation sessions in the app itself. I think it’s a good start if you want to know how to manage different areas of your life. I thinks it’s cool how it’s free but still it’s very limited I was expecting it to have more sessions in these but I guess not.. sadly one suggestion I have is to include more in the app and like get new meditation sessions everyday so that the app is fresh and we can learn more. Compared to other apps on the App Store there are a lot of meditation sessions to choose from so yeah.,I really like this it’s been helping me A lot with my anxiety I love  how it’s all ages app kids to grown-ups and  elderly’s. Is a great app if you have anxiety I really recommend it if you do it’s so nice I can’t  say \\nanything about it I just got done taking one classes and I’m feeling so relaxed right now so yeah,I truly love this app, this really explains how to begin meditation and walks you through steps to get you better at it. I love how it covers all ages and aspects of life. I wish you could rewind by touching the line around the circle instead of just 10 sec at a time.,I have tried several apps for meditation but after I tried this one I was happily hooked! For me, it is easy to navigate, well thought out, and a necessary addition to my daily self-care routine.,I absolutely love this app that why I am so sad that it only let me use it two days and now says can’t log in error. I hope there is a way to fix this because this app is very helpful,This is the best app for calming an anxious mind. I have struggled with anxiety all my life and Smiling Mind is changing the way I manage my worried mind. I can’t begin to thank the developers behind this app. You are changing lives!,What you get for free is better than many paid mediation apps on the market.,Great app that is helping me on my meditation journey. Love the narrator’s soothing voice and guided instruction. This is a game changer for me! Thank you!,This app was great until it totally stopped working. It just keeps say, “User not found” no matter how many times I try to login, create new account, etc.  It’s very frustrating and disappointing because I loved  this app.,I keep getting error messages when trying to log in,I downloaded this app and it will not let me register. I have heard great things about this app but cannot use it.,I used the app daily for almost a month now...all of a sudden it just stop working 😑,I am a teenager who would go to sleep after staring at the ceiling for about 30-45 minutes. I heard from somebody that I look up to that meditation was really good for you and that it helped her. Well for me I no longer just lay looking at the ceiling for more than half an hour. I did the sleep meditations and they really helped me and those are what I started with which is probably not how you’re “supposed” to do it but there is no wrong or right way. I then got a little tired of the sleep meditations because I’d done them so much so then I used the soundscapes. I put a soundscape on every night before I go to sleep. I love them and love the fact that there is a sleep timer so that I can set a timer for like an hour which is well over the amount of time it takes me to fall asleep now but it’s nice to fall asleep to the sound and not have to worry about turning it off. I am also all about a healthy mindset and self care haha. So I did so many of the meditations on the little self care area (Which I love that they have that). I just recently started the “how to meditate” just to further understand what I’ve been doing. I love it so far. I 1000% recommend this app for sleep problems or even if you’re bored in the summer and want to learn how to do something beneficial and something that could definitely help you in the long run. This was kinda a whole story but whatever hahaha. Anyways yea totally recommend this app!!!,Hello, I really like the content on your app and it has really helped me to develop my practice. However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible. Thank you for your timely consideration and namaste. I look forward to working with you in making the meditation community more inclusive.,I’ve always struggled with anxiety and not being able to calm down. All of the features which this app has to offer really help me when I’m studying (I like having soundscapes or music on), relaxing (breathing exercises or meditation), and getting ready for bed (sleep stories and body scans). It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. \\n\\nOne suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I’m doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can’t focus on sleeping with my thoughts). If you guys made some soft spoken or any kind of podcast in which there wasn’t a lot of yelling and loud talking, I’d totally listen in. (I know there are some masterclasses and lesson type things available on the app already, but they’re just not podcasts),Dear-Publisher,I have had this app for year and I love it so much, it helps me a lot but I deleted the app and downloaded it back and I’m glad I did. I know you may not have the some opinion as me but I think this app is outstanding. If the creator or person that published this app sees this, I just wanna tell how thankful I am that you made this all because it helps a lot. I know that some of the stories cost money but it’s still worth downloading the app. I recommend listening to “sleep paws” and “the secret lagoon” they are both amazing bedtime stories for all ages! There is no age policy for this app if you ask me I just think that there is only one thing that could make the app better which is making the stories a lower price or just making it cost 0 dollars itself because some of the stories look very interesting but I cannot read them because I have to do a trial and that’s the reason why umm giving this app 4 starts! So if the person who published this app sees this review I just wanna say thanks for making my life so much more easier but please Mack some of the stories more reasonable of price because I have read all of the stories which are the ones that don’t cost money.,There’s so much to this app there’s bed time stories, breathing exercises, music, sessions to help relax, meditate, and help u sleep, there’s also (one of my favorites) where u can have a calming background when on or off your phone, they have quotes to help motivate you, there’s daily check in’s you can do, you can set timers and reminders for things and so much more! There is a free app trial but you do have to pay after the trial ends but I think in my opinion it’s worth buying the app! My one recommendation though is that I think the calm app should add some more journaling to the app something more than the check ins because I think journaling is a great way to help you feel your releasing your past or just writing how happy you are if that makes sense plus if it’s not to much maybe add something to remind you to get off your phone and go outside or do some focusing hour on school work or something like that. Overall the calm app is a great app and I totally recommend if you have anxiety, or are having trouble sleeping! \\n-if your reading this have a good day/night/rest of your day/night!,Calm has great stories, meditations and more. I love it and have the full version. I love Anna Acton, Eric Braa, and other soothing voices. Some of them, however, are just a bit...jarring. I know everyone has different tastes but I like to listen to voices directing me during meditation or towards sleep that don’t jump out at me. Please, Calm, add more voices like Eduardo Ballerini, Ramon Tikaram, Chiké Okonkwo, May Charters and Jerome Flynn. Cillian Murphy is a great guest sleep story teller but please don’t just use celebrities because of name value. They don’t all make good storytellers/meditation guides. Some write the stories and I am grateful to those who come up with such wonderful sleep stories for adults. The ones that travel back in time, especially aboard old trains are outstanding! Just curate the voices a little better because some of us are too sensitive to the nuances of voice to listen to many of the meditations/stories. That’s kind of a waste. I end up listening to the same ones over and over. Please make the sleep stories at least 35 minutes, too. For those of us who need longer to drift away. Thanks so much!,During this time of isolation due to the pandemic, my daughter suggested I download this app. She’s been using it for a while and has premium. I downloaded it and I’m using the free service for now. This usually is not my “cup of tea“ and thought I would just try it. I have had a lot of anxiety and feel isolated and alone. I signed up and they have a very nice welcome letter. I tried one of the meditations and it is current with the times, it’s very relatable and because of that it has helped a lot. When I received the second long letter which I’m sure is a form letter but very well done, it has made me feel as if I am part of a community and a family which I do not have. Thank you from the bottom my heart for this wonderful app. There are plenty of meditations to choose from when you are first starting out and don’t understand the reviews about not having free meditations. This is a great stepping stone for someone who is new to meditation and I for one am very grateful. Great app. The meditations really are working for me and I recommend this to anyone who needs a little calm in their life.,I absolutely love your app! To the calm creators, I think they worked hard on this app..but there are some suggestions. For example, I know that these things and apps cost a lot to make..but please don’t squeeze the person who doesn’t want to buy or doesn’t have the money to buy supreme,(to listen to everything/everyone) it really isn’t that nice. People who need to relieve stress or anxiety or listen to the voices/stories they want to. I personally think there is quite a lot of things to listen on calm..for free. But not even close to premium. But just remember, I love your app, and a lot of people do too!! But just please raise the stories for the people who can’t pay..especially animal ones!! (Those are my favorite). I’m just giving some helpful feedback on your app..hope you use this advice and put it in an update! But if you don’t and don’t take a lot of the viewers advice or mine..some people might start deleting your app. Sincerely from a Calm User to the Calm Creators.,I am very reluctant to use this type of apps. However, this one always called my attention and during my last insomnia crisis I decided to explore. Oh my God, this app is not just a help to sleep better but to Live better! It has been about 10 days since I started and I am in love with it. I am 58 y.o. Venezuelan Female, Medical Doctor, married to a Wonderful Woman - my Soul Mate- living in a foreign country. She is deep into meditation and I feel so behind but I met Jeff and he has  introduced me to meditation in such an easy and accessible way. I have attempted for many many year with others but I always fell asleep. Besides and like now, I am at work and have some boring stuff to do. I just have to look for some new music on the app to switch my mood and be able to “keep walking”. So, Thanks Jeff! and thanks the lady with the sweet voice- can’t remember her name!- and thanks to all the talented people that make possible this unbelievable tool. My year subscription is really worthy to be paid!,This app is great! I love that I can customize the background picture and sounds. The background and sounds can still be present during the meditation if you set the settings to allow it. Otherwise, you could set the background sounds to silent during meditations. I love the daily calm and various meditations and sound scapes! I really appreciate that I can even set the length of calm sessions or body scans to fit my work day. The one thing I would add to make this app perfect is a mood tracker! They do have one but it doesn’t give good statistical data. I like to keep track of my mood and compare it weekly, monthly, and yearly. Having a line graph of sorts would help me track my mood better for my mental health goals. The lack of this one feature is why I still have a mood journal app that I keep forgetting to use. If the mood tracker in Calm was better at displaying patterns then I would just use this app for all my mindfulness, gratitude, reflection, and mood tracking. I really would like to see that feature added!,I’ve bought and listened to at least twenty of these “SleepyTime Apps” and I’ve learned a few things. Most of them are pretty cheeseball. Looping, cheap sound recordings that sound like they were recorded by your father’s cassette tape recorder from Sears, circa 1976. If those are the Chevrolets of the industry this is the Cadillac that they are ALL trying to rip off. I could go on about sound quality or originality but the real thing that sets CALM apart is that they never stop making themselves better, hiring more and more celebrity pros to come in and create their own new sleep songs, narrate their own bedtime stories. What makes CALM different is that they take most of that extra money you pay for their service and immediately re-invest it in the app, snowballing it, making it better every day. The CALM app that I will have a month from now will be better than the one I enjoy today. And they’ve kept this simple formula for as long as they’ve been in business. It works.,First let me say that while some reviews have requested more diverse voices for the daily meditations, In my case, I wish Tamara’s voice was used for everything including sleep stories as it’s the perfect formula to center me. I don’t know what it is, but her sleep stories put me to sleep in seconds.\\n\\nI could write a lengthy review, but to summarize, this app brings me to center when I use it every time. I am someone who is always analyzing everything, wakes up in the middle of the night stressed about work or bills or family things, and misses the quiet within myself. I generally have difficulty sleeping through the night. But when I commit to mediations and sleep stories, it completely does the trick. It’s unbelievable, and I was a disbeliever before a friend recommended meditation with a different app which led me to Calm. It has so many tools to calm and center me so that I can sleep, be more effective at work, be happier in relationships, and be at peace within myself.,So, I have had a difficult time sleeping ALL👏 MY👏 LIFE! When I decided to try Calm, I was a bit skeptical because I had tried so many different apps, skills, and techniques in the past, and NOTHING worked. I was still up for HOURS at a time each and every night, and waking up with 5-6 hours of sleep each and every morning. When I downloaded Calm, I did not have the membership. I was a bit disappointed with how little I could do, and how expensive the membership was. But the investment was worth it! The sleep stories and meditations have me asleep in 30 minutes TOPS (with the help of some anti-anxiety and sleep pills). I also have depression and anxiety, and the guided meditations are amazing! Every morning, I stretch with the guided stretches, and I do the Daily Calm and check-ins each day. No matter how dedicated to mindfulness and meditation you would like to be, this app is worth your time and money. I feel so much happier and more well-rested. I give an 11/10!,I like the app and have had it for a week so far and the layout is easy to navigate. The only downside is that you can’t put anything in your queue to play. For instance if you do a 15 minute mediation and want sleep sounds to play during the night, you have to go back in your phone after meditation to choose the sleep sound and manually start it. It seems counter productive to me to have to go back into your phone after a sleep meditation to play sleep sounds. If this app would allow users to put things in a queue to play more than one meditation without having to break the practice or to play a sleep sound after meditation without breaking practice by allowing users to use a queue, it would be perfect. Especially since we’re paying so much for this app and it’s not necessarily cheap. Otherwise has\\ngreat features and numerous different options for a tranquil experience,This app was fabulous originally, but they have “improved” some functions so they are not easy to use any more.  For example, we listen to the same Eric Braa episodes every night, but now they have moved them out of the instant display of my faves and buried them so I have to search for them in the middle of the night.  They no longer have new Eric Braa episodes and his voice is so soothing.  The recently used episodes should appear near the top of the category list so we can find them easily, not on the home page!  Give us a way to make our own category(s). Give us a way to remove all the children’s stories from the adult content.  Give us a way to totally delete content that is a trigger for us.  And finally, in the middle of the night, a dialog sometimes pops up that I have to put my glasses on to read so I can dismiss it!  That should NEVER happen.  I wish someone would listen.  I used to give feedback on each new story, but it never did any good so I stopped.  I don’t feel they listen anymore and I’m disappointed.,My toddler likes the Thomas the tank meditations. I got the premium subscription for $70 a year out of desperation to get my kiddo to sleep. Apparently I was pretty sleep deprived myself because I bought it twice, as explained by the company representative. One under the App Store and one online with an email. When I asked if she could stop one of them, she ghosted me. I still can’t seem to cancel one of them, and the other had been paid for the year anyway. It was one day until the free trial ended, and the rep refused to help me. Regardless of the content, which I don’t personally find helpful, I think ethically the company should not take advantage of people like that. I’ve led groups on mindfulness meditation for years as a therapist, and I think this content is just okay. Search for mindfulness meditations and lots of free videos will pop up. Or try reading or listening to real mindfulness like jon kabat-zin. Glad some people find this app useful, but I wish I’d never signed up. Paying for two premium subscriptions I barely use (and the one I can’t find auto renews!), feeling duped.,I’ve had a couple of different doctors recommend Calm and finally decided to try it. I’ve had chronic insomnia since childhood and was very skeptical, so I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The sleep stories are my favorite feature, but I often find that the story ends just as I’m drifting off, so I have to start another one, which completely wakes me up again. The anthologies have been great since they are longer and I’m more likely to be fully asleep when they end. Can we please have more long stories or anthologies?? Or could you develop a feature that allows me to queue several stories so I don’t have to manually start another?? If that feature already exists, please tell me how to find it and use it!! To those who complain about the cost...if you really cared about good sleep and how it benefits your health, you would think $5 a month is a bargain!! That’s what most of us pay for a generic prescription med to help us sleep!,I don’t know what I’d do without this app. I’m a life long somewhat insomniac that cannot fall asleep unless I have something that “occupies” my brain, so I can turn off all the junk I worry about. These stories are highly entertaining, and very interesting, yet calming at the same time. They’re also educational! I’ve learned many things from around the world that I didn’t know before. Most nights I’m out after 2-5 minutes, but some take longer. If I wake up during the night, I simply start a new story and I’m asleep again. I have my favorite narrators too. I find that male voices with accents other than American (with the exception of Erik Brah and Alan Sklar) really lull me to sleep. I need a deep voice lol. Females with British, Asian, Indian accents are great for me too. There’s also calming nature sounds and spa music. I’ve been using the Calm app for 2 years now and it never disappoints! Now I don’t have to reach for the Xanax anymore!,I have the paid version, and particularly like the sleep stories. They work so well, I usually fall asleep before the story ends. Problem is, I might wake up again a few hours later and want to pick up the story where I left off. But instead, I see the “Still Awake?” pop-up window suggesting other stories I might try, or maybe a meditation, and a pop-up asking if I’d like to rate that session, keep track of streaks and stats, etc. No, I’d really just like to find the sleep story I was listening to, but it has vanished from my screen. Now I’ve got to sit up in bed, grab my reading glasses, X out of the intrusive pop-ups, and scroll through to re-find the sleep story that was snatched away from me....leaving me not at all calm, but instead, annoyed and anxious, and now unable to fall back to sleep. Can you please provide a way to turn off these very unhelpful “helpful suggestions” and gamification features? For me, they are defeating the entire purpose of this app, to CALMLY fall asleep.,This is the best meditation app I’ve tried. I use it 1–2 times a day. Great mix of content and teachers for different moods, goals, and time commitments. While the sleep meditations work for me, I find the sleep stories with celebrity narration too distracting and gimmicky to fall asleep to, but I know others users for whom this is their favorite feature. Calm offers a series of sequential programs for mindfulness skill-building: “7 Days of ______,” where the next day’s content unlocks with the completion of the previous day’s. As a paying user, I wish there were a way to override this. I once exited a minute early, when the wrap-up was nearly over, because I had to leave, and the app made me redo that day to access the next meditation. Similarly, I just updated versions and lost three days’ progress in a program. I think the only way to catch up is to let them play out with the volume off, which is a waste of time and energy.,Has some lovely calming images and sounds, and the unlocked bedtime story to which I listened had a a soothing voice. There many unlocked sessions I would like to hear and wish the owners would at least give a sample of the voice and then allow me to purchase the episode to own it, rather than requiring  a pricey (for me) yearly  subscription, for which the product is forever gone when it runs out. I know subscriptions are becoming the way of the world, but still I resist!  I do believe people should be paid for their work; I’d just like to be able to actually purchase a product; I would rate five stars if they would allow this. \\n\\n“Calm” has a nice daily feature (one of the few push notifications I allow on my phone) which reminds me to stay in the moment, breathe, etc.   The app has some generous free offerings and I thank thank the developers for sharing these!,I get premium content through Kaiser insurance (which has been the best part of their mental health services, but that’s a different review....). \\n\\nI am so incredibly grateful for it because I’ve been using it for the past two months and it took me out a depressive episode. \\n\\nJeff Warren’s content keeps me around. It’s because of his 30 day course that I’ve finally established a meditation practice after years of sincere attempts. His approach is very human and relatable; I find sessions with his recordings much more fruitful since he sandwiches the nuggets of clarity between quiet moments. I’m able to ease into the session, instead of being urged into quietness then being lectured by Tamara..maybe that works for other people but it’s inaccessible to me. \\n\\nI also use the children’s meditations with my five year old daughter and the sleep stories when she’s having a hard time sleeping. I’m glad to share this experience and skill with her. I was fortunate to have an elementary school teacher show me how powerful meditation and journaling was at an early age, but didn’t have a way to reintroduce it into my adult life AND share it with my daughter till now. \\n\\nI used Insight Timer for awhile but was overwhelmed by the features and endless options. I like that this is more curated and it’s lucky Jeff Warren’s content is so appealing to me.,I have been using this app to fall asleep when I need a reliable source of comforting white noise for a few years now. It’s not something that I use all the time but it’s something I come back to on those occasions when I can’t sleep. Recently, when I needed my song that helps me fall asleep every once in a while, I went into the app to find it LOCKED for the first time EVER. When I clicked on it to try and play the song, (water falling by Kip Mazuy in “nature melodies”) a pop up comes up talking about a 7 day free trial and then a monthly payment after that. Unacceptable. You can’t just take something that has been free for years and then all of a sudden make it into a paid service. I know it’s a small issue but I am livid about this. I literally cannot believe this. You have taken my only reliable song that puts me to sleep when melatonin won’t do the trick. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now when I can’t sleep and need to. You people behind the app probably don’t care though. Obviously all you care about is your GD money.,“A resource to help people” that’s what I thought CALM was. And so, reluctant to seek emotional help because it’s such a personal issue, I turned to this app. And because I don’t have the means to purchase the app I have no access to their help. There is such a refreshing trend of prioritizing mental health in this age. But that’s half of the battle to actually helping people. I’m sure this app has good intentions but there will be no change in the epidemic of mental health issues so long as help is unattainable for ALL people who need it, not just those that can pay. If I had the means, I’d pay for a therapist. But those who lack the means to meet with someone are also left behind in such an accessible app that has such capability to make a difference. So my review: I feel very hungry for the help that this app offers and I feel truly left behind. I am sorry for the many others who I’m sure have come here searching for help, as I did, only to find help (once more) unattainable. Do we care about actually helping people? Or do we care only about hooking people?,Okay, I have a lot of trouble sleeping due to anxiety and stress. This helps, BUT out of everything I have looked at, there’s only four free things to listen to for sleep. I have favorited all of the free things and in total there’s four. I cannot afford the subscription either, so my counselor recommended headspace also so I also have that. But that’s not the point. There’s so many things that cost money, and I get it, you guys should have some things that need to be paid for but I don’t understand why there’s literally only four things that’s free and why subscriptions cost so much. Please cut it down a bit or something, many people have the same issues as me and can’t listen to a lot of things either because there’s so much things that need subscriptions and they might not have that kind of money. I have read other reviews and I see that other people agree with me.,Don’t get me wrong. All mediation apps seem to help sometimes and are great for dealing with stress and stuff, but this one stood out. It had so many programs and all kinds of useful tools that would be so beneficial... sounds great, right?? Well, there’s just one problem: *Everything besides probably 5 things require Calm Premium* (AKA money) AND ITS FLIPPING EXPENSIVE. Honestly, so many people in the world deal with stress and anxiety and this app could help them so much but they can’t because they would have to pay so much money. I get that the app needs to profit, but honestly the prices could at least be lowered a bit. I uninstalled this app after using the same mediation over and over again because I literally couldn’t get anything else. It just got boring after a while and didn’t help. So if this wasn’t so expensive and there was more to offer, I would completely recommend this. It’s just that one part that makes it not as great :/,I love the Calm app!  I recommend getting the premium content.  Calm is a tool for dealing with the challenges of life.  There is more awareness on anxiety, depression, and negative feelings.  I am hopeful for the future because this will improve people’s lives.  I gifted the app to my friends and family who also enjoy it - beautiful, inspirational meditations, music, masterclasses, teachings, body exercises, sleep stories and music and so much more!  I wish my family and I had Calm for difficult times in our lives.  I am comforted knowing we have Calm now for difficult times in the future.  I am excited to see the upcoming new content which is frequently updated and improved.  Thank you to everyone at Calm - you all inspire and help me!  You changed and improved life for my family, friends, and me!  And for many other people in the world!,I really love this app and the other things they do outside of it. I am in a field that overlaps Psych x Tech, and have genuinely only seen Calm create an app that is not bad for the user over time. I took a trial of it and afterwards decided to pay for it. I love the content, the voices, and the variety for all general life challenges that might come up. I often use the search bar to find something I’m needing a booster for, and it has gotten me through a few anxiety / panic attacks, and even taught me to get better with them over time through these small habit changes. I love the sleep sounds & stories as well for unwinding at night. Along with some other major lifestyle changes, Calm has helped me live a healthier, more zen life. I’ve finally learned to enjoy and get something out of meditation thanks to this app.,I have been a paid subscriber for years, and, until this year, I would have said that this app is perfect for insomnia: \\n\\nCelebrity voices coupled with the technique of measured cadence and gradually diminishing volume are features that make this sleep aide unique and more effective than any of the many others that I’ve tried.\\n\\nI only wish there were a timer on the nature noise that comes in when the sleep story is finished,  as it is the ABSENCE of noise that eventually wakes me up in the morning, like the opposite of an alarm. I use silence as my alarm on another app and it works splendidly, and is not nerve wracking, like an alarm would be.\\n\\nHowever, after years of satisfaction, an noticeable issue has come to my attention: More and more of the sleep stories are of a religious nature. At first the sleep stories were fantastic: funny stories, fairie tales, travelogues, poetry, even some to BORE you to sleep, like someone reading the rules of cricket! LOL \\n\\nBut, for some reason, writings are containing more and more religious content and I’m starting to feel like I’m in a class on Religions of the World, when I’m trying to go to sleep. This falls into the category of “persuasive rhetoric “ and my brain is busy analyzing my own opinion s on the theology or philosophy that is presented, keeping me from resting. \\n\\nCould we please just have stories that our brains will not be analyzing for truth?,This app is just unbelievable. I am a mom of two, ages 16 & 6, and I am also a special ed teacher, and I use this app both at home snd with my students!! Both of my kids have sensory issues as well as OCD, ADHD, and severe anxiety. My daughter’s needs are more severe than my sons are, and over this past year, there were some nights where this app was the only thing that got my daughter to sleep. She particularly loves the Disney lullabies and the Matthew \\nmcconaughey sleep story... can you blame her?! 🤣🙃😉 haha JK...  but seriously, they are so relaxing ... I even enjoy the sleep stories!!\\n\\nI was fortunate enough to receive a subscription for free when Calm was doing the give away for teachers years ago; however, even if I hadn’t gotten it for free, I would pay for it in a heartbeat!! One of the best apps we own, even if we don’t always use it!!,I have no regret with downloading this app. This app is so helpful when I am doing work or school and I just need a break from it all. I love all the scenes and sounds you can choose from! My favorite one is the fireplace! My recommendations would be to unlock more of the stories and sleep sounds and maybe add more mood check inns? I am not saying this to be critical at all because I love this app! Just a recommendation! My mom was actually the one who told me to download this app! She uses it all the time! Thank you so much for creating this app it helps me so much! I just started listening to the sleep stories on meditating because I have a lot going on in the pandemic and it helps so much! The creators did a great job in putting their best into this app because this app is the best! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,Iv been using this app for about a year now. Super helpful throughout pandemic!! Initially started using to help with sound at night to fall asleep. But now I love the sleep stories so much. The Exploring Ireland is played regularly in the evening and I now plan to go Ireland some day bc of the story. I use the  playlist during my yoga/stretching after a work out to calm down and relax and I’m obsessed!!  So highly recommend bc of the content! 5/5 stars! I gave it a 3 though over all bc it’s a very slow app. I’ll have full service every and other app works great on my phone but the loading time with Calm App is so slow  compared to other apps on my phone..sometime I’ll just end up turning it off bc it never loads no matter the WiFi or LTE I’m on... now idk if it’s my service or the app sometimes.  I’d give it 5 stars if the app was fast in loading time.,I love the calm app. I use it primarily for white noise to get my baby to sleep (works like a charm!), and periodically for myself for the same reason. I do wish it had a fade out ability, however, in conjunction with the sleep timers. It would be so nice to have it slowly drop in volume down to nothing. This is my biggest wish - it would make falling asleep to the tracks and STAYING asleep so much easier. \\n\\nThe app also has issues sometimes where it’ll take a few tries to get it to actually play again, or it’ll freeze on one of the sceneries and rotate, but needs to be quit/relaunched to actually function correctly beyond that. Minor bugs, no biggie. \\n\\nThe various meditative sounds are wonderful, and I’ve used them on really rough days. I genuinely appreciate having an app that slows my brain down.,Would be 5 stars besides the fact that you can’t ask Siri to play the daily calm.   For example if you can’t sleep they are asking to open your phone (waking you up more!) to then open the app, select a sleep story, open the air play menu, then finally select a HomePod from the menu.  What’s even the point?  If I even glance at my fantasy league or some thing because I opened my phone for calm because I can’t ask my HomePod to just play calm.  The Siri shortcut is no better you have to continue on your iPhone, same thing look at your phone.  The money you pay this should’ve been taken care of by now.  Apple has given the developer the tools with Sirikit media.  This is not unreasonable and for a app claiming to be about mindfulness you’d figure less screen time would be a top goal.  If this isn’t resolved by the end of my subscription year I won’t be renewing.  Content great, falls on app development,Edit: reducing to 3 stars until this stops randomly playing scenes in the background. I reached out to support and have not seen a reply. Has been over a month.\\n\\nCalm has become a huge part of my life. I’m on my 2nd year of my subscription and I am not looking back. I have grown substantially personally since starting this journey, and every day I deepen my understanding of my mind and how I view and interact with the world. I find Calm to be a blessing and it is regularly in my list of gratitudes. I think this is my most frequently recommended app, as it is the ultimate mental knife sharpener. You can better almost any aspect of your life with a daily sit. This may be the longest app review I’ve ever written, and that’s because it’s warranted. I wish I could give this app 10 stars as it is a life changer and I am eternally grateful for the course adjustments it has helped me make in my life.,I have been using Calm for almost a year now to help focus my energy somewhere else when I have late night panic attacks. Distraction techniques and most breathing techniques I learn from therapists or psychology classes I am currently taking do not work for me personally. My mind is too swarmed by my fear that I can’t focus on anything but that fear. Although calm does use breathing techniques, I believe it is not the “traditional” techniques taught in classes. These breathing techniques have you focus on certain parts of your body instead of your breathing itself. When I focus on my breathing, I actually start worrying if I am breathing enough and it doesn’t help, but calming my breathing through focusing on relaxing every part of my body helps me a lot!,I signed up for CALM quite awhile ago.  There are many times I have not been able to go to sleep... my mind is racing with various lists of tasks, projects, paperwork and everyday life responsibilities that have to be tended to.  CALM is my drug free alternative. It is nights like tonight that it gives me the most for my money.  I have my next chemo treatment tomorrow.  There are times when I am okay and can sleep, but recently it hasn’t been that easy.   So I turn to the app and I am usually out in 15 minutes.  I have yet to make it thru a story.  \\n\\nI was recently able to use the kids stories on two of my young god children.  I was babysitting one night and they just could not lay down.  I played one of the stories for them... they were not even a year old yet.  I timed it.  SEVEN MINUTES and they were down and out.   SEVEN MINUTES... what a blessing.\\n\\nI simply love the app.  If you question the benefits of paying for premium membership just keep in mind the monthly fee wouldn’t even pay for  a month’s medication so I am just fine paying for\\nextra content each month.  Especially since I KNOW it works.\\n\\nThank  you,\\nChristina Obenshain,Ok don’t get me wrong I love this app in all but what really bothers me is that almost all everything in this app is locked because you have unlock calm and it costs money the reason why I don’t unlock calm is because my parents don’t know I go through stress,anxiety,depression so I don’t ask for the money for calm,It really bothers me that I can only listen to a few stories in calm I really think that you shouldn’t lock almost all of the stories,lullabies,songs,mediations you know all that stuff I really don’t wanna ask my parents for the money I know there is a 7 day free trial but the 7days will end soon and I don’t wanna pay for it, this is really helpful for stress anxiety and depression but a lot of the things in this app cost money but other than that this app is amazing and really helpful to the people who pay for it.,This app is great, and has a wide variety of music, stories and soundscapes for sleeping. I just wish there were a few things. 1. I wish there was a way to load multiple stories at once, like a playlist so they could just start one after the other. 2. I would love it if when you pulled up a story or at the end of a story they had maybe like 3 other story suggestions that were similar to what you had just picked. (Like if I pick “dreams” read by Harry Styles, they would have 3 additional story suggestions that were similar). \\n3. I love the stories with music in the background, I would enjoy having this option on more stories. \\n\\nOther then that, this is a great app with so many options.,There should be a third category free, charge, and brief experience. Since it is probably is not your fault I gave 5 stars as the 3 free minutes I found before I deleted the app had great content. If there is more free time it took me too long to find it before feeling I was being taken because I had to give my private information before being given access to the 3 minutes I found. SUGGESTION: 1. clearly label the free stuff. 2. Give the free stuff away without having to jump thru a bunch of hoops. 3. Don’t give any free stuff away in this situation so the customer knows what they are truly getting. Most customers like me a used to a generous amount of free content such that they can make an informed decision Thanks,This is the first review I’ve ever written on Apple. Never thought of it to be worth my time. This app, however, transcended my previous notIon of time and peace in the mind. After a stressful day at work, I have struggled coming home to my wife and baby girl with a positive attitude. When I’m in my car on the way home, I tune into Calm. Whether it be a relaxing piano melody, sounds of the rain forest, or listening to Lebron on how to train your mind to master emotions. I’ve also got into meditation and yoga for the end of my days because of this. My new found self-awareness and positivity has become evident to my family and has been profoundly beneficial. Thank you to the devs of this app, you have done a truly fantastic job. Namaste ✌️,I had to open up to it because I was anxious at first in general. You may know how that goes.. but wow. I’ve been benefiting so much. From the stories and meditations to the reflections and check ins. I could say a lot. But most importantly, I feel a: more relaxed and clear, and b: pleasantly surprised to know more about myself and feel growth. \\nand the only reason I would be surprised at all is because I try to have an open mind when it comes to apps. This app is great. I would suggest the free trial and definitely experience it the full way through to see how you like it. I opened up to exploring more after a couple days. And I felt inspired to leave this review. Best.,Calm has been in the news lately—good news, for doing good things—so when my subscription expired earlier this week, I was only too happy to renew it. I’ve been using the app for a little over a year now, off and on (trying to be more on than off but sometimes keeping good habits is hard), and I find it very useful. It’s well organized, easy to navigate, lots of variety, and helpful reminders to make it a habit (assuming you respond to the reminders, lol). I also like that I can log in through my browser and play some of the music playlists on my computer while working. All in all, an excellent experience with this.,Most of what’s offered here isn’t traditional meditation. The focus is definitely on a lot of talking and guidance. The paid plan gives you access to a large number of sessions. But most of these are by one individual. The lack of variety is surprising, especially give the cost. Starting in Jan 2021, the offerings improved, but mostly more of the same. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, the app supposedly tracks your sessions. Results are inconsistent, with some sessions not logged. There was briefly a display of a weekly goal, in addition to “streaks.” Now I’m on a new phone and that is gone? Why? A few months ago, sessions weren’t being logged if the app wasn’t open when the session ended. <sigh> Again, surprising shortcomings for the price and how long Calm had been around.\\n\\nI got subscription through Amex, which is nice, but I won’t be renewing. That’s for sure.,I might delete soon if I can’t figure out a way around listening to Tamara. This app is amazing in concept. Really great UI and I LOVE the sleep stories and the soothing voices of some of the actors that have made appearances on the app. But the way Tamara speaks GRINDS my gears and is so not soothing. Her phony upbeat cadence actually gives me anxiety and reminds me of a dog food commercial where they’re playing that whistling upbeat commercial tune. I know, I know... My review is very un-zen. But it’s because I just excitedly opened this app to get some much needed calming, and heard her very unmeditative voice. I should clarify that I’m not criticizing her actual voice — but rather the method of narration and cadence, which is overall too bright and energetic and phony. Frustrated and wanting to love this app more. \\n\\nRecommendation: Let us select the narrator for guided meditations!,This is going to sound extreme, but this app has changed my life. Not only have I been able to fall asleep without any stress, I actually feel lighter every day.  There are so many fun extras in this app as well! You can track how your feeling each day. You can write short gratitude lists, and even go for a deep thinking question.  I’ve had insomnia all my life.  I put on a sleep story and I’m out without worry or stress.  I tell everyone I know to get the app and subscribe!  My mother and I often joke about how long we can make it through a story.  Run don’t walk. Get this app and subscribe.   I would give this 100 stars if I could.  Bravo calm and thank you.,This app has changed my life in so many ways. I now wake up earlier and happier.  I am a better mother Bc I have more patience and a better understanding of my boy. I have a better relationship with my bf Bc I am more tolerant, calmer, and level headed. Tamaras voice is so calming and her messages are so inspirational that I find myself wanting to listen to her all the time. It has improved the amount I drink and WHY I drink and I have nearly quit smoking. I have begun to work out and WANT to work now. I’m so much more down to earth and chill. I am so happy I found this app. I told a friend about it.... I saw him a year later and he said it changed his life as well!!!!  I cannot recommend this enough. I love it,Calm app is awesome for when it is thundering outside because I can put sounds on. Calm covers every need I have especially considering I get frustrated easily. My counselor showed me this app, and I loved it. The only thing is that whenever you log in, sometimes it just glitches you right back out of the app. About every year there is also this time, and for about a week calm just freezes and kicks me out of the app. You also have to pay to use calm for a year. If you don’t pay, it will only give you like 1 soundscape, 1 song, 1 book ETC. So I wish calm could not have the membership part, and I wish calm will one day fix all the glitches that come out. Thanks for reading! \\n(I still love this app though!!!),So much useful content in many of the modules. But will I find it again? The navigation is not only incomplete, counter-intuitive and not comprehensive, but the content that is visible is in a state of constant and extreme flux. Everything is constantly changing, shifting and changing position. Modules are often suggested in batches: choose one, then you’re done, because there’s no “back” button. No way to return to where you were to check out the rest. Modules are suggested based on experience, the path I’ve taken through the app, but there’s no way to replicate that experience to bring those same modules back. They’re gone. Maybe I’ll see them again. Maybe I won’t. No way to know.\\n\\nShould I treat my experience in this app as an allegory of life? A metaphor for the unpredictability of existence? A simile of the not-knowing beginner’s mind? An exercise in spontaneity, an acceptance of the not-desired, or of gratitude for the what-is?  “Life is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you’re going to get.” \\n\\nSorry. I get that every day. I don’t need an app for that. \\n\\nThis frustration with the interface is not what I want from an app intended to foster “calm.”,I really enjoy the simplicity and various aspects of the app when it ranges from beginner meditation, daily meditation, sound scapes or even music. The easy access on my phone makes it a little easier to make meditation a habit. \\n\\nHonestly I gave it 4 stars because I wish there were more options for the self check ins. I’m not just tired I’m exhausted. I’m not angry I’m aggravated, annoyed or frustrated. I’m not unsure but I can be melancholy. It’d be nice to have more accurate progress checks, self check ins or reflections. Especially since I signed up for the premium. Also I wish there was more spiritual guided meditations, reaching a higher self or working on strengthening your intuition. It’s nice to work with those from time to time.,I downloaded calm on the recommendation of a friend about sleeping. I started with the 30 day introduction to meditation and found it very helpful as a start to meditation. I tried a few daily calms but I found Tamara’s voice a bit grading at first. Sorry tamara! However I began considering that that was simply a resistance I was having in my mind to embarking on a practice and was then easily able to overcome that thought and I now find Tamara delightful. Many days I find very useful guidance and advice in the daily meditations that I am able to bring my life with my family and particularly in a challenging work environment where I am the leader of many diverse personalities.,This app has been wonderful. It has helped me fall asleep (and back to sleep) so easily. I’ve always wanted to meditate but I have a difficult time sitting still for long so the short, guided meditations are perfect. I’m happy to pay for it - the cost is much less than a therapy session and gives me a daily dose of mental fitness. My only suggestion would be to have a couple more voices, especially for the sleep meditations. I enjoy one person for the daily meditations, but the rise and fall of her voice doesn’t work well for me to fall asleep too and she is on many of them so I find myself doing the same few. Not a big deal really, but just a thought.,In many ways, Calm has been an incredible source of guidance for me throughout my life. It has introduced me to amazing practices from around the world and helped me to navigate along my journey. Over my time using this program, I’ve been able to develop a mindset that has opened me up to the beauty of wellness and because Calm’s content is always expanding, there’s always something that I can look forward to. It’s brilliantly designed and formatted cohesively with many features that can be tailored to any liking. I can say with sincerity that Calm is one of the best experiences of its kind, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to take the time to practice self care.,This is a worthwhile app, however it has limited fiction stories for adults. Some of the children’s fables have been interesting and some not. Adult stories like The Time Machine, Gulliver’s Travels, Gift of the Magi were wonderful. There were interesting, but I was not so engrossed in the story that I could not drift off to sleep. Most of the nonfiction stories do not engage my mind enough and thus my mind starts to wander. One app category is fiction stories but the majority of stories listed in this section are nonfiction. Seems like it would not be hard to keep the categories straight.  I Had not planned to renew because I found another app with more adult stories but I missed the deadline and was already charged. I will keep one more year and hope for more adult fiction.,I don’t know if I’m the only one having this issue. My phone or iPad tends to freeze while using the app. I can’t force shut off my phone or iPad. I can’t exit the screen I can’t do anything. This becomes extremely stressful I don’t know if it’s just lagging or if my devices are frozen. I’ve tried to see if maybe it’s because there is a live background with sound for this app, I thought maybe that’s the reason for the glitch. I tried to see if I can turn it off but there’s no option to turn it off. I love the app and the stories I just don’t like that it causes my device to freeze to where I can’t close the app.,I downloaded the app on a recommendation from a friend. Overall it seems ok except for the nag screens about enabling notifications and the default background noise that takes a help search to find out how to turn off. I looked for an app like this because my life is already wound too tight, and these two aspects alone just about made me delete the app before I even listened to a second of content. I shouldn’t be feeling more stressed by an app that’s supposed to help me be calm. My suggestions… don’t make notifications a focal point at initial startup, and give the user a clearly identified choice to turn on background noise or have a silent scene. Not everyone is thrilled by constant noise, especially high pitched crickets.,Calm has some of the greatest sleep stories with a huge range of topics and narrators’ voices. Almost all the stories are 20-30 minutes. There is still no queue feature so if you wake up in the night, you have to go in and choose another story (very poor arrangement in this with Calm’s Still Awake? Page that blocks access to stories) and hope that looking for another story doesn’t wake you up more. Some poor design elements, like a virtually hidden Search by Narrator feature, which was hidden more during the last update. Still, it’s one of the better sleep apps. For the ANNUAL subscription price, though, I’d expect it to be perfect. 3.5 out of 5 stars.,I bought the premium subscription. While I enjoy what it offers, I’m not sure it’s worth the money. I use it primarily for falling asleep. I like the sleep stories but they aren’t long enough. It’s counterintuitive to have a sleep story that’s so short you have to open the app again to continue playing stories. I would like something that’s long enough to still be playing even if I wake up an hour or more later or at least it appears on the Lock Screen to repeat. For people with true asleep disorders, the app currently defeats the purpose. \\nAlso, ads slow soothing visuals but these are not actually on the app. Not sure why they’re on the ad if not available on the app.,I’ve been using this app for over two years and absolutely love it..use it to put my grandson down for a nap too.. he loves the Velveteen Rabbit.  My favs are Jerome Flynn and Stephen Frye and just to many to list them all.  Even got my three aunts hooked...the giggles that came from them as soon as Matthew McConaughey says “hello there” was hilarious..they are all between the ages of 65-70.. my husband and I use it almost every night and I really don’t think we’ve ever made it though one to the end.  The music is also very relaxing and my dogs (two English bulldogs) also love relaxing to the stories and music..definitely worth the money I paid for the app,If you wait about 24-36 hrs and don’t use Apple to sign up for the app, it will email you a 40% discount. 40$ or $2.40 a month for 1 yr. I’ll be honest that’s not so bad and I’ll probably buy it with the store credits accumulated from delivery refunds from ****.  I’m still not convinced though cause if you want to cancel it sounds like you’re not given a portion of the refund back which just sounds like a $ grab and if you’re going to develop an app about mindfulness you should be more mindful of your customers. I will read up on it’s refund policy, if it’s only offering annual subscriptions and no refunds after cancellation that at least offer 50% back within first 6 months then I will not be purchasing.,I used to use this daily- see my original review below. Now I get stressed out every time I open because it\\'s so busy and rife with options. There are so many choices it\\'s overwhelming. And, the ones I used to like, I can\\'t even find. I finally deleted it. Going to search for a simpler app that actually brings me calm. \\n\\nThis  was my original review: I\\'ve been using the app for a couple of years and eventually upgraded to the paid version. I like being able to pick how I want to feel. You can choose the background scene/audio (the fireplace and misty stream are my favorites). You can also pick the focus of the meditations (eg. energy, gratitude), and the length (2, 5, 10+ minutes). I was fairly new to meditation and this app made it really easy for me to do it regularly and enjoy it. I\\'m happy to say it\\'s now a consistent practice in my life!,This app has provided a pleasant and meaningful experience for me over the past 3 years. It has provided coaching and guided insight as I have strengthened my daily meditations and have sought to bring meaningful mindfulness into my life. I have found “what works for me” out of the large variety of content, customizable background sounds/music/volume and coaches. The cost has risen to support the expansion of new content, most of which I have not found appealing, but it’s there for those who do. I would like to hear an expanded selection of looped sound tracks for deep meditation, such as singing bowls.  Thank you for a wonderful, meaningful offering.,I was rewarded this app because I’m a k4 teacher and I like to incorporate mindfulness and meditation into out daily schedule. Initially it was a bit pricey so, I kept waiting and eventually they began their school program, which waived the membership fee for teachers!  This has been an amazing addition to our room. The meditations, soundscapes, and sleep stories are some of my students favorite part of the day. It definitely sets the tone and helps aid an open and inviting atmosphere. It’s an extra treat that after a long days work with 4 and 5 yr olds, I can use the same app to calm down and energy me time at home!,There needs to be a LIVE customer support system.... I know Tamara is busy rolling in the dough but she needs to offer an actual support system when the app has issues. The automated system is useless. The app Is pretty freakin awesome.... just been having issues with scene volume which is one of the best features that sets this app apart from other guided meditation apps. When I contact “customer support” it’s an endless loop of pre written “generic” answers to an otherwise very specific problem. Sometimes these answers seem to cater to older people that may not be familiar with the basic operations of a smart phone. A little pandering. Other than that it is a superb app.,This app looks like it has lots of great content, however I didn’t get to fully explore it before deleting. My main issue isn’t what’s in the app but rather the app’s behavior on my phone. I would keep going back to switch off cellular data, background refresh, and other such things for it and would return shortly after to find the app had switched itself back on. This happened again and again even after updating, restarting, anything I could think of that might cause a glitch. It wasn’t every app that would do this. There were just this and two other apps that I’ve also now deleted that would turn themselves back on. I don’t know if this is a glitch or if it’s a really creepy intentional feature but I wasn’t cool with that.,I’m really enjoying this app. It was recommended by a trusted friend who never steers me wrong. It’s a great investment, especially during these difficult times. We need to take better care of ourselves and each other and it truly begins with some personal mindful meditation or calm moments, other than just plain bravery in the midst of so much chaos. \\n\\nMy favorite thing on this app is also the most simplest - the breathing exercise. Just in and out, with two simple relaxing chords and a simple expanding circle visual. But there’s so much more, and many meditations to choose from. I also enjoy the music without lyrics, and I’d like to see more of those. \\n\\nI think the only thing I take issue with is that my choices of meditations with voices are cut in half because I prefer femme/female higher voices than deeper male voices because of certain personal triggers. Other than that, this app is very helpful and there are still a lot of choices. \\n\\nOverall my suggestion would be to add more nature sounds that evoke change, like birds and wind, and lyric-free music. Thanks.,I’ve never written a review in my life, probably because I’ve never been so disappointed about a product that I love so much (should be loved). It’s been a week plus since the latest update came out, that’s ample time to fix or go back one update to where a higher volume of your customers had access. Yes, in the past there was the occasional issue (once a month, if that), but nothing like this where the screen is stuck on “take a deep breath.” I like so many have been a subscriber for several years and have used Calm religiously every night (it allowed to get off of sleep-aid medication), but now I am having to find other means to fall asleep. If you don’t hurry up and fix the app, you may be losing another longtime customer who has praised you and promoted you several times over!!,Honestly, I am surprised at the exorbitant cost I am paying for this app considering the few times I use it a month. That being said, those few times a month it is totally worth it and definitely puts me to bed. I’m in a sales role, high stress, corporate job and this app helps me wind down and go to bed. \\n\\nWhy I hate Tamara Levitt- She has to be one of the most narcissistic persons on the planet. I hate her VOICE, I hate how much she loves her own voice, she sounds scripted, I hate how breathy she is, I hate that she doesn’t leverage other people for meditations. Here’s an idea Tamara, not everyone wants to hear you! For the love of God, get over yourself and find other people/ other voices so I can get some better rest and pay $100 to get some rest.,So I just got this app because I have trouble falling asleep sometimes, and I got this in hopes to help with that. However when I got on the app I couldn’t really find anything that was free witch is kinda disappointing seeing as there are so many grate reviews, I understand why everything costs but it would be nice to at least have a few songs that are free so I know what I would be paying for or if I didn’t have money to spend on the app. In short  I did see some ads covering this app and it did seem like a really good app I just wish there were at least 1 or 2 free songs for the people who couldn’t afford to spend the money or who just wanted to see how things were before spending money.,Maybe I’m in the minority here, but I have completely stopped using this app because every time I did, my blood pressure would rise. The features are not well-organized, such as the settings (which really can’t be adjusted all that much, and you can’t adjust very many of them anyway). God forbid you accidentally push the wrong icon (which don’t have intuitive designs, by the way), and you start hearing talking and/or video that you can’t back out of right away without force-closing the app. Gee, how calming.\\n\\nAlso, there’s an almost worship-like over-reliance on celebrity voices. I don’t care what one of these overpaid idiots has to say — unless their fame is a product of their being good at what this app promotes.\\n\\nLastly, I cannot stand that when I open this app, the first thing I see is a command: “Take a deep breath.” *You* take a deep breath. Stop telling me what to do with my breath — that is something I control, and it’s no concern of yours. \\n\\nThis app is annoying, overly insistent, aggravating, pretentious, and convoluted. It boggles my mind that it’s highly praised, and I absolutely regret getting such a long subscription — probably because I was going through a tough time in my life and I thought this app could help. It didn’t.,I started using Calm as a Respiratory Therapist when COVID hit.\\nI didn’t know how to deal with what I was experiencing at work, fearing for my life or bringing it home to my family, and the politics that said it wasn’t happening.\\nI took Calm to the restroom at work because a break isn’t always possible when needed and listen for two or three minutes and learn to follow my breath, hear the waves on a shore, or rain falling and take my body sensations that were responding to my negative thoughts to a better place.\\nAt home I started going to sleep with Calm.\\nThank you to ALL who are behind the scenes and in front at Calm.,I love your app! I use it everyday and particularly love the soundscapes. I use many of the focus playlists during the day to block out noise to work. However you’ve added so many different categories and lists that I can’t find anything anymore. I really wish that all of my favorites across all the categories could be listed in the favorites. Currently, in music I have to scroll down and hunt for my favorites. It takes to long to find what I need. When you keep adding things, we need a way to quickly access what we need so we can get to work. I don’t need to spend so much time hunting. It really messes with my calm. Thanks,I noticed the benefits of the Calm app almost immediately. I usually start self-improve activities and do not feel like continuing with the program or process. With Calm it’s different: I look forward to the next session. I was feeling very apathetic, negative, and stressed; within 2 minutes, that energy and thoughts transformed. I even went back to journaling.  I highly recommend the app Calm, even if it costed thousands of dollars a year. Life is priceless. Calm is bringing me back to life, a wonderful, positive, Blissful and happy life. Thanks and Blessings to the people that created Calm; it’s a gift for humanity and the world.,I used to use this app every night when I was younger, it helped me sleep and it was a blessing and mostly free. Now that I’m going into my senior year of high school and have begun having trouble falling asleep without stimuli, I decided I would revisit this app and see how it does since I want to stop using my laptop for background noise. \\nNeedless to say I am surprised and disappointed by the changes made. Nearly EVERYTHING is behind a paywall. I only managed to spot three free sounds, one of them being the default. Based on my past experience with this app I would say that the price of the yearly subscription is POSSIBLY worth it, but for the people who either can’t afford that kind of money for an app subscription or just straight up aren’t willing to, this is a big “oh well”.,Low key so glad I got this app! Initially I got it because I had trouble sleeping and wanted to try their sleep stories. little did I know that I will find a whole new world in mindfulness meditation. I’ve been meditating for 4 months now and find such joy, peace and even learning how seek gratitude. I LOOOVEEEE the Camilla Cabello collaboration; another sign this app was just something that I needed to incorporate in my self-development journey. The only thing I’m a little bummed about is the Calm Body- they only have like 8 options (lower back, morning stretch, etc). Other than that, I’m happy with this app/investment!,Last Night I used Calm app’s “story” feature for falling to sleep. First of all, I was easily relaxed by the voice of the reader. It was soothing without sounding ridiculously forced as are those of the many other apps I have tried. \\n    I wasn’t sure I’d find a story relaxing, because in my other attempts, I have tried meditations which have sounded like hypnosis sessions, and nature sounds that awakened my alarm sensors over worrisome storms.\\n     For me, my first try was well worth the  apps cost. Since I found Calm useful, I may keep the app. $60 a year feels outrageous. However, it is, after all, pennies a day ....zzzz,Meditation isn’t something I was super familiar with before I bought this app, but a therapist, in conjunction with some books I read, suggested that I try it. Now, I won’t go a day without meditating in the morning. It’s how I start my day, and it’s an integral part of my well-being. The journaling aspect is invaluable, and I have recommended this app to countless friends and family members. The only thing I would suggest to the developers is to allow the music portion (new music by Keith Urban is 👏🙌👌🏽) to be played outside the app, so that when I’m checking e-mail, making dinner or using another app, the music still plays in the background.,Ever since I started using Calm I have enjoyed my sleep time so much more. I also have found more ways to relax,focus,center myself. When I started using Calm. It was free. Then they added additional which cost or only came by buying their plan, but my favorites were still there & free. Not I discover to continue using this service. I have to pay. I guess I won’t be using calm much if at all. I don’t agree with this as the benefit of the service to all of us is important. I lost my job & was forced to retirement. I’m 74 yrs & live in a strict limited income. I’m sorry to lose you.,I really like this app! I mostly use the sounds it comes with that are free! (You can find these sounds on the home page and in the top left corner you will see mountains and you click on that and you can play different sounds) My only problem is how much costs money. It’s kinda stupid how much costs because all you can really do is play those free sounds and do some “how do you feel” questions. I would really like to listen to the sleep stories because I’m a kid with ADHD and it’s very difficult to fall asleep at night, and all the stories cost! I don’t make that much money for a kid. My only request is please make more things free. Other than that this is pretty good! Have a nice day/night!,After reading some reviews, I am glad to find that I am not the only person who can’t stand Tamara Levitt. The content is great and what she’s produced is amazing, but the way she guides the meditations is so...fake. She says everything in this exaggerated way, dripping with sweetness and condescension, like she’s forcing herself to be calm and nice and soothing. Nobody talks naturally like that! Unless you are a privileged white new agey woman from California. I cannot listen to her daily meditations, her courses, or her sleep stories. They make me angry! I don’t love all the narrators but she is the worst! I have never heard anyone with such an annoying voice in my life! Maybe she should narrate Fox News, it would fit the content better. Instead of Tamara I think you should replace her with Eric Braa. His voice is gold.,I can\\'t say enough how much I love this app.  It has trained me in how to settle and focus myself, while also making a habit of it.  It is my little space of peace in very hectic days.  Not sure how Tamara knows just what I need to hear in the daily meditations, but it almost always hits me in just the right way.  I have tried other mediation and gratitude programs and apps, but this one has everything and the best teachers.  There are even parts perfected just for children and my little ones love listening and practicing with me.  \\n\\nWorth every penny!!,It’s been a banner year of stress and worry. I developed anxiety and panic symptoms. At 60 years I’ve never tried mindfulness or meditation but with all that’s happened —quitting a job that I loved, starting over in my own practice dealing with fears of COVID, for our country for my daughter’s future it’s no wonder anxiety and panic were the result. My daughter added the Calm app to my mobile. \\nI loved 7 Days to happiness series, the panic SOS exercise, and the Grateful ( Gratitude) series.\\nThere’s always something here for what I’m thinking and feeling.\\n\\nThe Loving Kindness exercise. I’ve been alone for most of the pandemic. But grateful for this app.,I truly enjoy this app and it has helped me be more mindful in my day to day. I tend to be an over thinker and have codependent tendencies and am using this app to help calm my mind. I have only been using it for about a month and I can already tell that my reactions to things have switched into responses with a much more clear head space. \\n\\nMy one piece if feedback would be that the developers add a feature that when using the app your phone automatically goes into “do not disturb” mode so that texts and phone calls do not distrust your mediation practice.,The sleep story I tried was effective for helping me fall asleep, however these are only about 30 minutes long.  I woke up several times during the night and restarted the story, which worked, but if the story was longer, or if it could have been configured to repeat, it would be much less disruptive and possibly I may not have actually had to fully wake up.  \\n\\nAnother missing option is to have one of the ambient tracks, or anything, play automatically after the story.\\n\\nThe interface is not good for sleepers.  Controls should be large, obvious and omnipresent.  Mucking around with controls is disruptive for sleep and for those of us who do not sleep with our glasses on, (read everybody) very frustrating.\\n\\nThe subscription model for this is very expensive.  The idea that new stories and content is an important aspect for sleep is flawed.  Good content does not need to be replaced as familiarity only helps with falling asleep.\\n\\nFor now I am going back to using boring Audible audiobooks played at .6 or .7 speed.   These play all night and never need to be touched once started.,I just could not get to sleep, I tossed and turned for 2 or more hours at a time and was at my wits end, I didn’t know what to do. I was taking medication to help me sleep and I didn’t feel that was a good idea for long time help. \\nI saw an ad for Calm and I thought it couldn’t hurt to try it. \\nCalm taught me how to breath and relax so I could fall asleep quicker without tossing and turning. I listen every night and look forward to new sessions and have favorite go to stories too.\\nI would recommend anyone who is having trouble getting to sleep give this a try, it worked wonders for me!,When I first purchased this app I was absolutely in love. I enjoy Jeff Warren’s 30 days of How to Meditate so much that I finished the meditation in consecutive 30 days and was always looking forward to the next day to meditate with him. I was so clam and happy. But after I completed the session, everything changed. For some reason I can’t bring myself to like the voice and talking style of Tamara Levitt. I tried very hard each day to like it but failed. Unfortunately she is the main narrator of most of the courses so there is almost nothing left for me to enjoy. I would really appreciate if you can include more narrators or allow the user to choose narrators like the course 7 Days of Calm.,I have had the calm app for a few years. Lately the quality of the new sleep stories has been terrific. I recommend trying the app. I love the new Red Rock Country story. I find the sleep stories have regulated my sleep after years of so-so sleeping. I am working on my meditation and so far the calm app has helped although I am struggling to find a meditation program that I can use long term. As a beginner in this area what Calm offers is helpful to build a consistent practice. Overall I am pleased with the content and I hope Calm continues to provide even better content.,What I love most about Calm, is it is only 10 minutes a day, if you choose, or you can select up an hour meditation. It is guided and you choose the way you meditate, whether lying down, in a nice bubble bath, or sitting in a comfortable spot. Doesn’t matter how you do it, just as long as you find 10 minutes a day. There are a variety of sleep stories and now the new Daily Trips 10 minute meditation is great because it gives guidance on daily mind situations we encounter and how to be mindful of those moments. Definitely will be a customer for life with Calm.,In August of 2019, I applied to get Calm for free. The people at calm said that if you worked in education and wanted to try it - let them do it for free! I am a social worker in a low Socioeconomic school district and people in my circle laughed “ you are going to get these kids to meditate?”  Let me scream it from the rooftops- THIS APP HAS CHANGED THESE KIDS MINDSET. I love this app and would pay for it every year for the rest of my life!! If I am honest, I don’t think I could personally live without it in my daily life, either ! Thank you Calm for bringing peace to so many of my patients and to my life, as well!,Unfortunately, the main voice on the app is like nails on a chalkboard to me, not soothing at all. So, the daily sessions she offers and many of the specialty sessions, I can’t listen to. I realize we are all different, but I wish there were more voice options for situations like this, or that she would hire a voice actor with a soothing tone like all of her guests. At this point, I can only enjoy guest sessions so I will be discontinuing my subscription and switching to another similar app that I’ve found. \\nI do like this app and find that it helps my child and myself. Let me know if the voice options come about, and I’ll subscribe again. There are some nice exercises and affirmations here.,Update:   Your newest update repaired the glitch caused by the previous update. No more crashes. Thank you!  I mostly use Calm for the background sounds and sleep stories however I have enjoyed several other features like The Spark.  I would suggest that the Daily Calm be narrated by other voices in case the main narrator’s voice doesn’t work for your listeners. A little variety is nice.  Overall a good app. \\n\\nOld: I enjoyed Calm until the latest update. Now I get a purple “take a deep breath” screen and then it crashes and closes. No access possible.  FIX THIS PLEASE!,Whenever the manic pace and daily stress of life pushes my brain into overdrive, careening from all that did not get done today and bouncing off all that must be done tomorrow, the soothing music and simplistic sounds of nature embrace the soul ever so gently.  Somehow my mind  is transported to simpler times and back to a place of Calm.  As stress is gradually replaced with a sense of well-being, my entire spirit is regenerated and healed.  What a wonderful gateway to peace.  In this state of being fully present,  I am once again centered on all that is truly important in this journey of life!   All else falls away... Thanks Calm!  I needed that...,It would literally take me hours to fall asleep because my mind would just wonder, but the sleep stories and soundscapes have put my mind wondering to an end. They’re interesting enough to keep your mind focused, yet soothing enough to let you fall asleep (not like having the tv on while trying to sleep). I use this app every night when falling asleep and sometimes turn it back on if I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. I highly highly highly recommend the Calm app and everything it has to offer.,My kiddo has always had a hard time sleeping. We’ve kept a steady routine: bath book, bed. We have tried so many things. Moshi, a night light with sound machine, air purifier, singing, back rubs. I had given up. I downloaded the Calm app because I wanted to start meditating to deal with the crushing stress of being a working parent during a pandemic. I stumbled on the kids stories by accident. My kiddo was asleep within 12 minutes!! I was astonished!! I am so grateful for this app. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving an exhausted parent the gift of sleep!,So, i downloaded this app for the sleep stories, however you don’t have access to those without the annual fee or 7 day free trial. i tried it the first night and it didn’t help so naturally i tried to cancel my subscription. however after the 7 days were over the money was still taken out of my account even though i had already canceled my subscription. i just kind of feel stuck with it now because it took the money out of my account even after i canceled my subscription before the trial was over.,Today is a sad day indeed. I have been a premium user of this app for over three years. Somehow my auto-renew got shut off and when I came on today, I saw that it is $70/year now? I have never paid more than maybe $20 or less for the premium service and now suddenly all of the meditations I have come to love are not accessible to me. I’m having a baby in two months and unfortunately the premium services for this app has become a frivolous expense that I can no longer justify. I’ll keep it around because I truly love this app, but it is sad to see all of my favorite sessions unavailable now. :(,I use headspace often, love it. But I have been curious what Calm is about and I have to say I enjoy this app as well. I am an insomniac and easily anxiety prone and so I wanted to see if this app could provide me something different then headspace. What I like so far is the daily calm and the fact that I can put my mood, gratitude and insights into the software daily, almost like a journal. Helps me to slow down at the end of the day and reflect. I think I like the sleep stories in headspace a bit better, but with both apps I can get the best of both worlds.,Thank you for how supportive you’ve been and you help me fall asleep every time nothing doesn’t stop me from sleeping in your app. My parents separated when I was 3 years old and I miss my dad slit and wouldn’t be able to fall asleep. At first I used to think calm was for grandmas who have sleep issues but I learned there are different meanings to this app and many of them are helpful to me. Once again thank you so much for this app you have created I’m only one of the many people you have helped with the same kind of problem.,Been using the app for over a year now.  Let me just say, it helps my 5 year old with naps and bedtime.  Our favorite sleep stories are Luna’s Lullaby, Ella’s Treasure by Tamara Levitt.  It works like a charm every time.  My only gripe is that, for some odd reason, the developers have not  bothered to updated the Apple TV version.  Unlike the iPhone and iPad version, there is no search option and a very limited amount of content available.  Honestly, it’s kind of annoying having to airplay sleep stories from my iPhone and iPad.  It’s for this very reason why I’m giving a four start rating.,I’ve been using this app for about 3 months. The beginning meditation course is really great and worth taking. Also like the sleep stories. But I will not be renewing. Should have gotten 1-2 months instead of a year. Here’s why:\\n\\nTLDR: App is poorly designed; make sure you like Tamara Levits way of speaking before subscribing bc she’s 90% of the guided meditations:\\n\\n1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings. Also, ever meditation has a huge picture which seems ok for people new to the app, but unnecessary for whose who just want to find what they\\'re looking for. These things can easily be fixed and I hope they do something about it. \\n\\n2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt. I understand a lot of people probably like how she speaks (vocal fry, trying too hard to sound soothing), but I find it too distracting. So basically I can’t listen to 90% of the guided meditations.,I love this app. Some nights I drift away to the gentle sound of the ocean, mesmerized as each wave invites me to enter uninterrupted sleep. My favorite is the crickets and meadow stream; I feel like I am camping and the song of the crickets shut out every stressful thought that tries to infringe on much needed rest. The purring cat is soothing during the day, and comforting when I am alone grading papers. I pass on the washing machine and do not find it relaxing. Anyone that enjoys the sounds of nature or struggles with insomnia needs this app. I am sleeping better than I have for years.,I love this app. The only thing that would improve is being able to have a que for listening.  So I could do a short meditation, that immediately goes into a sleep story, then  turn on one of the sound scapes.  If I’m on the edge of sleeping but the story ends and I realize it,  I will wake up to put another one on.  I use the sound scapes a lot to drown out noise that wakes me up, but that doesn’t work if I fall asleep listening to a sleep story.  So makers please add this feature.  I can’t be the only one that would like this.,I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been wound up tight and said , “ I really need to meditate “. I say this to myself because I Know it helps. Spending a few minutes , maybe even 15 or 20 minutes , has this effect: change in my thinking. All of a sudden , what seemed urgent and irritating , scary or anxiety causing, is not how I’m viewing it anymore . It’s not that the situation is gone , but my thinking is now different, and this thinking seems more balanced and rational . \\nThe Calm App makes attaining this Easy. \\nThank you many times,I tired maybe 10 different meditations apps and after nearly a whole year of searching, I decided on this one. Even got the lifetime subscription for it since I personally hate to add to my monthly expenses and feel a lot more relaxed knowing that I’m not wasting my money by not using it “enough” in a month.\\n\\nIt has bells, nature sounds, music, stories, pretty backgrounds, it looks nice and it’s quite polished for an app. And yes, it has a good meditation collection as well as new daily ones. \\n\\nSome suggestions for future updates:\\n\\nMore nature sounds and higher resolution backgrounds.  Casting this app on tv would be great too. And I definitely would not complain if you would add binaural sounds option for those of us with headphones.\\n\\nOverall, if anyone out there is still hesitating on which meditation/calming app to get, I would say: just get this one. It’s good and it gets updated regularly.,I have been using the free version for almost a year now. Money is tight with COVID-19 and today I went into to the sessions where they have the free sessions to listen to and practice meditation where locked and I now had to pay. It hurts that they would take things like this away. I had been hoping that when money wasn’t so tight I’d be able to get a paid membership, but I don’t know if I can trust them right now and feel they aren’t really trying to help people become less stressed and more mindful if they are practically forcing people to start paying to use their app when there is so much negative stuff still hanging around.,As an educator, I’ve been using Calm for years to help my students unwind after standardized testing and to help me fall asleep. I love this app. I have favorite narrators, and if I have a hard time falling asleep, I know if I put on anything by Bhav, Alan, or Eric, I’ll be asleep in minutes. \\n\\nHOWEVER\\n\\nThis newest update has made Calm stay on the opening screen, and not move beyond “take a deep breath.” I can’t get to the sleep stories! And having gone through an interstate move and starting a new job in the past two weeks, my stress is at an all time high. Please, Calm, fix your app! Thank you!,So I love the sleep stories. I think most people agree one persons relaxing voice can be grating to another. I don’t understand except from a guess that she started the app why the meditation section is totally dominated by one person in particular. And I’m sure there might be many that find her voice nice but personally I would like variety and am disappointed I pay for calm and while the sleep stories keep having a wide range of readers , for those of us who want to meditate it’s always the same person. Please expand on options. Especially in light if nothing else or cultural diversity etc,I was hesitant to drop $70 for the year, but made sure when I started the week trial I was really ready to put it to the test. I have been using Calm for a couple months now and it’s well worth the less than $6 per month price tag. \\n\\nThe variety is great, Tamara is awesome, and I love that you can identify meditations as favorites. \\n\\nThe one thing that I really find myself wanting is the ability to also identify ALL meditations that I have tried. Some I don’t care to return to, but don’t have a way to know which they are. With that functionality, Calm would be an easy 5 stars from me.,I’ve had the calm app for a few years now. I love the sleep stories and have told many about them. However, in the past 2 months this app has been buggy beyond usable. I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall more than once, which is not what you want to deal with when you’re trying to wind down and sleep for the evening. The two main issues I’ve had are the app just not loading (staying on “take a deep breath” screen) or the scenes not playing in the background, which I use for white noise as I live in an urban area. \\n\\nHope these bugs get fixed soon and permanently!!,I tried it a few years ago and I liked it but I have it free for a year through being in an HR program and I’m really liking the daily calms and also the sleep meditation but it doesn’t seem to be a lot of sleep meditations which is kind of bothering me at only looks like there’s like 10 or 15 so what happens after I do it for a few weeks I thought it would be like hundreds so if the developer is reading this I’m a little disappointed about that but maybe I’ll find other stuff to listen to at night,This is a fantastic app and continually adds new content to and for sleep stories, meditations, classes , music and more. I especially like the daily Calm and the new Daily trip. I love Eric Braa and Jeff Warren’s soothing and clear voices. Some of the story tellers and speakers have voices that are difficult (for me) to hear or listen to, but these two men have wonderful voices, clear enunciation, and soothing speech. I love the constant updating of new material and variety. If a person is serious about calming their life, he or she will not regret purchasing this wonderful app.,I have really been enjoying this app. I love that there are so many options. \\n\\nMy biggest problem though is that there is no place to see everything I have favorited! Why?! There are like three different areas that show favorites but none of them list everything, I hate it. \\n\\nThe downside to so much content is when you don’t provide a way for people to easily find favorite items. Please make this slightly easier to use by giving us one place to see our favorites. One list with meditations, sleep stories, music, all of it.,I came across this app through an Instagram app and decided to try it out. I love the wilderness sounds especially living in the city. Once in a while I can hear birds chirping in the morning but it’s very minimal so that’s why I love just hearing the sound of wilderness while using the app. The second time I went on Calm, I decided to try out the sleep cognition sound for about 30min before actually going to sleep and I fell asleep right away. I’m excited to explore the app a little more. Definitely recommend Calm to anybody!,I’ve absolutely adored this app! I’ve had it for over a year. I first started using it for free, but quickly realized being a paying member would be worth it. If you use it daily, or even weekly, It’s honestly such a small price to pay and 100% worth the investment. I primarily utilize the sleep stories, and play rain at night.. but I’ve also dabbled in daily check ins, master classes, and meditation. This app has saved me from so many anxiety driven nights. I will forever be grateful to this platform. Thank you!!,Calm app helped keep my newborn happy and me relaxed through quarantine. Whether playing our baby, or myself, a sleep story, or using the soundscapes while working from home, the content is practical: volume doesn’t fluctuate like on some podcasts, stories are just stories and not ads, and everything is organized well. And it’s all relaxing. They also add new content often enough to keep it fresh. One request: please keep the train and non-fiction sleep stories coming! Thanks.,This app has been a tremendous help for my anxiety. I struggle with anxiety on an almost daily basis, along with semi-frequent panic attacks. I have been using the Calm app to meditate daily. There are several series on managing stress and anxiety. I started off with the free version and then quickly purchased the full version. My husband and I enjoy listening to the soundscapes at night as well. The price seems steep, but if you break it down to what it would be per month, it’s not bad at all. I couldn’t be happier with this app. Thank you, Calm!,I really love the calm app and it has made me see the value of meditation in my daily life. However, if you don’t have the premium version you can only do about 5 of the meditations, and they have hundreds in their library. This is frustrating to me because I know that not everyone has the financial means to purchase the premium membership, yet apps like these strive the make mental health care accessible to people of all walks of life. I think it would be beneficial for the calm app to unlock at least a few more of the meditations so that the largest number of people can benefit from their great resources.,I’ve been using this app for years. I stepped away the past few months but when I came back I found that the “Daily Trip”. Levitt’s Daily Calm is the centerpiece of the Calm app but it seems to be getting phased out. Its very hard to find. Search bar just brings up 2 collection of Daily Calm entries from the past.\\n\\nLevitt\\'s Daily Calm has pulled me through some tough times. Her voice is a big part of going back to that warm place. I do not like that I have to dig for it or go to the browser version. It is still the first meditation on the home screen in the desktop browser version.,I was introduced to meditation in my teens in India by my father and various other teachers but after moving out of India more than a decade ago I lost touch with my practice with life getting busier and and busier. I was not able to find time and a good instructor( I enjoy guided mediations) but then I came across Calm and Tamara Levitt! I enjoy her 10 min daily calms where she offers great breathing techniques and wisdom in each session. These 10 mins a day have put me back in the habit. You will find good sleep stories,guided mediations and amazing music here!,I only wish that Calm would diversify the  voices and narrators for the daily meditations. Having the same person for all of them is a bummer, especially because her voice is kind of annoying. Some voices just are for some people, and for others they are perfect, which is why I would love it if Calm used different voice actors for that section, they way they do with the sleep stories. Other than that, I love Calm! Highly recommend it! Use it almost everyday. 🙂,I really am loving this app, I use it every day for a.m. meditation and music to keep me less stressed during the workday. I love that they keep adding new music. My one annoyance, and the reason I only gave four stars, is because they only allow you to choose a female voice for most of the meditations. In my personal experience, I find I do better with a male voice, and I wish they give that option more often. Some of the meditations allow you to choose between a male and a female voice, and I think all of the meditations should do that.,Relax as you calmly drift off to a peaceful sleep with Calm...it works wonders! I have been sleeping much better lately since I downloaded Calm. And I need beauty sleep! Anyway, listen to stories that are so serene, they make you fall asleep in a sentence of them. The Calm songs have a relaxing beat to them that you can just lie there, listening to music, or just drift off to a relaxing sleep! \\nCalm, thank you for everything you do, we love you, always, and hope you keep updates going. You have my moral support. ☺️,For an app that is supposed to create calmness this app sure does cause a lot of stress and annoyances. \\n\\nFirst songs do not always load when clicked on. Often times I’m having to close out the app and reopen it in order to play the song/sounds I want. Second. The UI is way too cluttered after the UI change. No quick access to my favorites and way too many categories and too much going on. \\n\\nClean up the interface. Simple is better especially for a calmness app. Fix your ongoing problem of songs not loading. That should be a basic operation of a music playing app.,The calm app is one of the best resources you will ever come across. There are so many ways to use it. The lessons learned are insightful and encouraging. It’ s like having a new best friend that you can access no matter the time of day. It has definitely helped me learn how to deal with anxiety. My sleep has improved as well. I love the sleep stories, the meditations, the daily meditations, and all of the other applications. It’s always being updated.\\nDo yourself a favor and give it a try. You’ll be happy you did!,I can’t even start with how bad this app is. I will not pay for something that is supposed to be given once you download the app. It is one thing for maybe half the content to be locked unless you  buy it but it is another thing for 99% of the content to be locked. I found three sleep stories that were unlocked and they would put you to sleep not because they were calming and relaxing it boring and dull. There was literally a story called the rules of tennis. I would love this app if I didn’t have to pay for most of the things I should get for free. I do not recommend this app if you are not willing to pay for the content. This app was more trouble that it was worth.,This app saved my life. Other apps are nice and help a bit but this one is a completely different level. So happy with this! Yes I did have to pay, but it was worth it. From my crippling anxiety, ptsd and insomnia, this is everything. Helped with mindfulness while falling asleep, very effortlessly. Other apps it feels like I have to try harder, but this just lulls you into getting better. This app is the equivalent of a hug and makes me feel like a kid again, being comforted. Puts me in the best headspace ever I love it.,I am extremely lucky that I can take advantage of this FREE 7-Day Premium Trial, offered by Calm from the Apple App Store. I just downloaded it and already can’t wait to see all I’ve accomplished at the end of the trial. I am confident that I will be continuing my journey of Self happiness, better sleeping, reducing my anxiety and Etc. If your able and willing  to try the App, I promise you will not regret this experience. I used to be the biggest doubter and now I have become the biggest believer!,This is definitely the best app on the market and even with the free version it is extremely helpful. I have recommended this app to all of my friends and family as well as Facebook groups I’m in to help people who struggle with mental health or just struggling with stress. I used this app to help me navigate my emotions and heal through my divorce. I went from struggling with depression to being able to let go and heal through medication.\\nI love that you have options of who you prefer to speak on a lot of the medications.\\nI prefer the female voices myself.\\n\\nThe app is so easy to navigate through and has different categories for what you need. I love the sleep category and use this for my kids as well!\\nI’ve used this app for them since they were 18 months and 3 years old. \\n\\nI struggled with sleep before this app.., now I’m able to find inner pease.,For a while, me and my family loved this app. It was great for sleep and stress and there were a lot of options. \\nBut then Calm decided to what all apps just CANT RESIST.\\nWelcome to Calm Premium.\\nNow there aren\\'t hardly any options at all. All the sound loops are locked without premium except for one. It gives you about 1 meditation per category and that’s it. I liked this app so much better before. Now the only way to make it worth it is to pay $15 a month. And all of the things that are locked always come up in your recommended. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. I would not recommend this app to my worst enemy.,Calm helps me stay centered. I have learned to let emotions go and not get caught up in thoughts. Recently I was getting angry and developing rage with waiting for a customer service agent to answer the phone to address an issue I thought I had resolved the previous week. I was able to recognize and dismiss this inappropriate response and not get caught up in angry thoughts. By the time the agent answered, I had calmed down and could focus on resolving the issue. I think using Calm for a year taught me to do that. Thank you.,People have lost there minds and way and this is a great start to reconnect to yourself. Easy not complicated. Only recommendation is for people like my wife, there needs to be a baby step real short meditations to walk a person to what there really trying to find. It’s just that some people just focus  on time so shorter till there capacity is longer. Thats my only complaint. Also food suggestions like  Indian theravedics or basic Buddhist diets . It be nice touch for morning start.,I can’t praise this app enough. The 10 min Daily Calm is part of my morning routine and sets me up for a better day.  It centers me, grounds me, calms me.  It helps me become more focused throughout my day.  My thoughts are less scattered. Tamara Levitt’s voice is soothing. The stories and lessons she teaches are life-giving. I’ve had to manage anxiety and depression my entire life.  Incorporating this 10 min routine each morning for the past year, along with other treatments, has been quite healing. Thanks to the entire Calm team.,I apologize for the dissertation but I needed to share...\\nI’ve slowly wandered away from my Daily Calm sessions over the last 18 months or so.  When I read the daily inspiration this morning I decided to invest the 10 minutes.   All I can say is I’m grateful I’m a lifetime member. The universe called me today. I’ve heard and read theories about worry and anxiety a thousand times.  However, this morning’s Daily Calm on reflecting on your worry and the onset anxiety hit a cord in my sole.  Thank you Tamara and entire Calm Team!,Love this app! I have been using it for 2.5 years now and it has helped me to be consistent in my meditation practice. I look forward to to the time to myself each morning and I love the little “gold nugget” of wisdom the Tamara leaves with each listener at the end of each session that gives me a helpful concept to consider throughout my day. And the additional Spark sessions are interesting and helpful short listening segments and the masterclasses are enlightening as well! Get this app!!,I’ve used this app for a little over a year and love it. Love the sleep stories, check ins, and the meditations. But sadly, I (and a bunch of other people too apparently) can’t use it anymore because I’ve just been stuck on the take a deep breath screen for weeks now. I thought they would fix it, but I guess not. I would cancel my subscription but it just renewed and I’ve already paid for the year, so if at some point between now and the end of the year the fix it. I will happily revise this review because it is a great app but since I’ve already paid for an entire year I would like to be able to use it.,I previously reviewed this app stating that I love it and it’s helpful. I still feel that it is, however I’ve been pulling away from it because the content that updates isn’t something I’d use or use to help me fall asleep. The stories are great, and the Daily Calm topics are helpful if you need them. But what I need is to sleep. PLEASE add more sleeping music, not soundscapes, not stories. PLEASE add music that’s going to repeat. My renewal will be approaching soon. I’m not sure if I want to renew for another year...,This is a great app with great content that will really help you become a better version of yourself if you truly intentional invest. I see so many complaints about a lot of the content not being free but with all the stuff people waste their money on that doesn’t help better themselves, this is an investment. Great and more than enough free content if that’s what you prefer but i have the lifetime subscription and it’s well worth the little over 5$ a month.,I just re-checked this app after a couple years away, and there are some amazing updates that I absolutely love. \\n\\nHowever unfortunately 95% of the meditations are STILL only one person Tamara, who has a grating voice with an affected “vocal fry“. I don’t understand why the app still doesn’t offer various different voices, they say she is their “head of mindfulness“ but her a voice is like nails on a chalkboard.\\n\\nOnly 3 meditations have a male alternative Jeff and his voice is great, very listenable and soothing, but this isn’t enough content to make me pay. \\n\\nI’m also surprised that I still can’t search by length of meditation, for example today I want to do a 20 minute meditation and there’s no way to search for that. \\n \\nReally disappointed as (unlike many whining angry reviewers) I am ready and happy to pay $70 for a meditation app, and I wish it could be this one. I think having one person do all of the meditation is a mistake. Offer more options. We’re not all going to be able to stand listening to a weirdly affected way of speaking.,I have the free app, an older version and I absolutely love the scenes option. There are a few that I use for meditation. However, on my newest device, I have downloaded calm in order to access scenes. Sadly, it is no longer an option. :( The 7 day meditation is also no longer free. Bummer. I have considered purchasing the yearly however, without the scenes, I cannot. I honestly don’t need rain sounds. I love the grounding sounds with the scenes option... still a great app for some people. I refuse to use the latest version as it no longer contains scenes.,This app is amazingly useful. I read about it and always wanted to try but the price was holding me back! I tried the free trial version and enjoyed it fully. Great help for beginners. There are stories, different meditation modes etc. that helps you calm. I finally purchased it as promo from one of my credit card and I am loving it. I started using when I needed extremely. As I used it I realized this must be use on daily basis. Anyone who wants to calm and meditate must try this.,In theory this app sounds like a great idea. This app was not what I expected nor what I have seen advertised. I have been on the 7 day trial and have been using it before bed to help me sleep. I like that you have the ability to set sleep timers for the soundscapes and meditation, however I tried multiple sounds and most of them stopped within 10 mins on their own (even though I had a timer set for an hour, 1.5 hours). So getting pulled out of relaxation just as you’re starting to fall asleep is a bit jarring. I definitely won’t be spending $80 on this app.,I love the daily check-in especially since it allows you to let all of your emotions flow freely and it\\'s private so only you can see it. I like the emojis that can represent moods, but please add more like \"Passionate\", \"Powerful\", and \"Scared\". The stories are mostly premium, but you can get by with what you have alone! Please add the daily check-in to ads because I think people will want to let their emotions free by writing down what they  think. Thank you! 100% recommend!,I took the first opportunity when there was a discounted offer, to purchase a lifetime subscription. This app has literally kept me afloat during this pandemic. I have suffered from chronic insomnia and anxiety and my mental health has benefited SO much from the check-in meditations and body scans, especially at bedtime. The sleep stories are great. I fall asleep every single night to softly falling rain and Tamara reminding me to focus on my breath and not my worries. This app has really been a lifesaver for me. Tamara is a national treasure!,Use Calm daily. Sleep stories help me sleep and soundscapes are great for concentration for work or relaxation.  \\n\\nCreate Sleep Stories Playlist please, please, please! This way you can listen to multiple stories in a row without having to manually select it. Restarting the story every time I wake up so the story doesn’t end really is disrupting. \\n\\nFor very light sleepers that wake up at any change in sound, continuous play of sleep stories would be helpful.,I am subscribed because i just really wanted to try the other ones and it works so good there is so much other stuff then just sleep…. During the day i do some breathing exercises and listen to the music of there and when im having a hard time trying to sleep i just pick a story put it under my pillow and im asleep in 2 min…. When you play the music you can\\'t put a sleep timer and set for however long you want. I usually put mine for 3 hours,The application design is good. The app works nearly flawlessly. However the service is expensive, and most of the content is blah at best, such as a person in a soothing voice telling you how to relieve anxiety with suggestions you could get from a google search. Some of the content is good, such as the music selection but overall you could probably do better elsewhere. I joined through a special offer through my AmEx card. I cancelled the 1/2 price auto renewal since I find I am not using it anywhere near enough to justify the expense.,This is my third year with a premium subscription to “calm”. I have really enjoyed it and recommended it over and over again. \\nLately, and when I say lately I mean for at least a month, it has been opening at completely random times. I can be talking on the phone and the Wizard of Oz pops up. I can have my phone sitting on the console with a podcast on and all of a sudden  Calm is playing.\\nI have deleted the app and reinstalled it. That does nothing. Just now on the phone with a client a meditation began. \\n\\nI’m not sure what’s happening but it’s not pretty! Ready to go to the social media route and shout to the masses!,Great app with lots of offerings. I haven’t been disappointed by any of my selections in the year + I have been using it. Regular, daily updates keep things fresh, but the favorites are always there. Whether I’m waking up with the Dailly Calm, putting my son down for a nap with Thomas or just putting on some ambiance to help me work, I use this app multiple times a day. There are few things I truly use every day on my phone. This is one of them.,I’ve had this app for a little over two years, and the yearly subscription you pay for this app is definitely worth it! They have sleep music, for all kinds, sleep meditation, and all sorts of different kinds of sub categories you can chose from for your guided meditations. \\n\\nI never meditated before this app, but this is a really good starter app if you’ve never meditated before, it was really easy for me to start this up. Wonderful app, and love the way it’s laid out!,I have tried to use this app and it kept shutting down only a second after I open it.  I deleted it for a while and then reinstalled it a month or so later and it worked fine until the meditation music let randomly playing in the background without prompting or even the app being open. The only way I could stop it was to turn off the phone. I eventually deleted the app as it kept going off during my zoom calls. Seriously please figure out what is going on so I can start using it again. I have another meditation app I can use in the meantime.,First let me say that I love, love , love this app.  I have had problems sleeping and this app is awesome.  It puts me to sleep quickly.  HOWEVER, the recent constant crashing and restarting of the app is starting to just plain aggravate me before I go sleep. It will crash on me 4 or 5 times a night. This started recently. Any ideas on how to fix? I have deleted the app and downloaded it again. Still having same problems. I love this app and I am seriously bummed that I pay for it and it is not working correctly.,My 13 year old son & I used the free features to meditate & calm down for years. He loves this app. My husband uses it to help him fall asleep. I loved this app so much I bought a subscription a couple of years ago. I have regularly used the app, since, and have recently purchased the lifetime subscription. I appreciate it for it\\'s wide selection of free options and the apps ability to utilize multiple senses to support mindfulness practice. It is worth it! 🥰,I bought the lifetime version of the app after discovering their 30-day program on how to meditate with Jeff. It’s a fantastic program! I highly recommend it!\\nOnly then did I realize that 90% of the other programs are narrated by Tamara, whose smiling while talking makes it impossible (for me) to listen to. She comes across as phony.  I know, I know, meditating should enable me to ignore this, but I don’t know yet how to do it, and learning from Tamara is just not happening. \\nPlease, Calm, continue developing your offering, and get other narrators because right now your value proposition is much lower than your competitors’.,I\\'m asleep in minutes! Meditations are great! Reliefs anxiety! Best app!\\nThis app really helps me fall asleep! I recommend 100%! \\nOne thing though! The app is a little slow, which is fine, maybe it\\'s just my iPad but if you know how to, please fix this! \\n\\nOk this app is amazing! Sleep stories ALWAYS make me fall asleep! I have tried other apps, but this app is the one that gets me to fall asleep. I mainly do the sleep stories, but I\\'ve tried the mediation too and there great too! I love your music! I also love the daily check in! Best app ever!\\n\\nUpdated feedback:\\nI just thought of something, I don\\'t know if you have this, but if you don\\'t could you add the option to make playlists of your favorite calm stories, music, and meditations. You could have playlists of your favorite music that makes you fall asleep!,Cool in theory. Saw an ad on Instagram so downloaded the app excited to try it out. Oh wait, literally everything on here is locked and requires the premium membership. 2 sleep stories are free, absolutely none of the music is free, and you can do a few of the mediations. Everything else is locked. Another reviewer said they went online to see what was free and there’s “tons of content,” but I haven’t found any available. There was a momentary glitch that made it seem like a lot of the music was free, but when I went back there, all the ones I had access to a minute prior were now locked.,I have been using the Calm app for more than five years. Teaching, masterclasses, music, bedtime sleep stories, and focused meditations have helped me through the years and has become a part of my morning daily ritual. The Daily Trip with Jeff Warren has been a balm in many ways to help me grow through lifes challenges. The app is well organized and it is easy to access all the different choices. Highly recommend this app.,But I can assuredly say that because of this app my life has markedly improved in sleep, motivation, focus, and happiness. Been using for a week. \\nI love the utility and variability of the kinds of features for meditating, sleeping, lowering anxiety, etc. The stories are excellent with lovely voices and takes. Cillian Murphy on a train in Ireland. Tamika Brown in an apple orchard. The ability to sleep  the phone while using the app is probably it’s best feature. \\n5 out of 5 (so far),My experience with calm has been amazing. It’s great for people like insomniacs and students with busy lives and nights filled with stress and worry. It has helped me a night owl to want to go to sleep and even sleep better!! I love calm but the one thing I really wish was better is the voices and music, there all amazing but sometimes to loud! so loud that I can’t get it to a point where it’s just right maybe I just have sensitive ears? Over all calm is a great experience and you should definitely give it a Try.🤗☺️👍👍❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️❤️♥️🧸,Dear People Who are interested,\\nThis app is crazy awesome! It\\'s so calming. I listen to books, and listen to sessions (some are free), and my favorite mood journal! It\\'s beautiful books like \\'Floating With The Florida Manatees\\' and \\'Luna\\'s Lullaby\\' and much more. I love doing daily sessions and being able to show my friends how much it does. It changes my heart and makes me feel confident. When I feel weak and scared I just go on calm and start some sessions and listen to some nice books. \\nSincerely,\\nSmartReviews,I have been a poor sleeper forever. I have had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep for decades.  After just two nights at the trial in this app, I have fallen asleep in less than 10 minutes of just the body check preview!!!   I am so impressed and extremely thankful for this app. My healthcare provider recommended this and I was skeptical. I’m a believer now. This is a true blessing. I can’t wait to put my EarPods in tonight and shut out the world.,I’ve only been using this app for a week and the difference is noticeable from day one! I knew I needed to do something when I noticed more anxiety & poor quality of sleep particularly these past 2 months.  The first day I did a guided meditation I slept like a baby, like a deep sleep and woke up rested.  The morning practice also helps me start the day in the right mood, with the right perspective.  I would give it a 6 star rating if there was one! ☺️,This app has help to calm my lambic system several times. Whenever I have anxiety, feel sad, or just looking for a moment for myself this app helps me to come back to balance. \\n\\nRemember balance... it is not perfection, it is more the fact you are conscious about your feelings and look for an answer of why you feel them. Let them come with compaction and from there, start going through them to reach peacefulness.,I started meditating to preserve a shred of sanity in the pandemic. I purchased Calm Premium and am really happy with it; I love the daily and special meditations, the reminders, the music options, really just a fantastic program for anyone who wants to become less reactive and more accepting.\\nMy only suggestion is to mix up the narrators. Tamara Levitt does an excellent job, but at a certain point it’s like a radio station with one host. I wouldn’t change anything about her, but I’d love some other options.,His How to Meditate & The Daily Trip are completely different than traditional approaches to meditation.  He makes it easy, relatable and most importantly, he keeps it real. Everyone can meditate and make it work and make a difference in their own lives.  His meditations are soul food for mental health.I also find the sleep stories helpful when I’m having trouble getting to sleep.  They work for me.  Completely worth the yearly fee.,I’ve tried many of the meditation apps and Calm is definitely my favorite! Super easy to use and calming interface. They have a great variety of meditations for different moods and settings, which I have found incredibly valuable. I love the “Daily Calm/Trip” series. Great 10 minute daily meditations with a different focus everyday, I always learn something new! I would definitely recommend this app for anyone interested in meditation.,Honestly, it\\'s an amazing app and I adore it but can\\'t afford to go premium at the moment. When I did have it, the app did wonders for my mental help and I\\'d eagerly recommend it to everyone. The only thing I\\'d suggest to the developers is to perhaps allow people to buy a single story or meditation. I have 2 favorite stories that would put me right to sleep every night and would love to be able to just have those rather than paying monthly for every available thing.,I haven’t given every feature a try, but the sleep options are wonderful. If I wake up, which previously wold have kept me up for hours, I refrain from reading news or social media and instead go to this app. It’s a game changer. I am amazed at how quickly I can fall back to sleep. Note that I have small children that wake me up frequently and this will work multiple times in one night.,Like other users I used to enjoy this app.  It is used as part of a program for my work place benefits.  We can use the app to get points but now this one, along with Headspace, (these are the only ones that work with my benefits) charge for almost all of the meditations.  The cost of this app compared to the points I get for my insurance make it not worth it to pay for.  I’m really disappointed as it was nice to use for some quiet calm time and especially for sleep.  Maybe if it was cheaper it would be more worth my while.  🤷🏼\\u200d♀️,I use this app every night, I do a mediation\\n and listen to a sleep story which puts me to sleep every time. It would be an even better experience if I could filter/sort the sleep stories by length, by narrator,  if they are new, etc. Sometimes if I’m feeling restless I want the longest sleep story possible. Keep up the good work, Tamara and crew!\\n\\nUpdating my review to beg again for a way to filter sleep stories. Really don’t care for the UX because it’s hard to tell what’s new. Let me sort/filter by how new sleep story is and how long they are.,I went from closing the pop up for a good year to trying the ap. I wish I had done it sooner. I am a chef/owner of restaurant in the time of Covid. Sleep and mindfulness went away in March of 2020. In the two short weeks that I have been using Calm I have slept for more than 6 hours each night, and woke feeling rested. I love the meditations, and haven’t been able to get through one story with out dozing off. Surrender to Calm. You will not regret it.,This program is wonderful. I’ve been plagued with sleep problems my entire life and this program has helped so much. I use it almost daily for its sleep content and have recently started the stress program and meditation exercises. It is such a help with my sleep. \\nI now have a life membership and have no regrets. I began with the free program, which gives you enough to sample the program, then moved up to membership.,After using the Calm app for for four months, my mind senses when I need to relax and my body responds. My should relax, my mind gets quiet, and I automatically concentrate on my breath. \\n\\nI feel myself desiring to focus only on the present instead of dwelling on the past or trying to figure out the future. \\n\\nLove the variety of ways that I can meditate and the messages that available.  The reminders are very helpful throughout the day.,But I seem never to do that. Here\\'s the thing: if I go to bed realizing I won\\'t get enough sleep, I tend to lie there and stew over work stuff. When I launch a sleep story, it removes all the responsibility of work. It\\'s like a real bedtime story, and you don\\'t MEAN to fall asleep, of course.\\nI have been trying to listen to a description of a great library for at least 3 nights now. I can\\'t do it, no matter how much I try.,First off why make an app free when you download it and then spam me with 30 month trial only 7.99 a month. App makers like this are scammers only trynna make money and get you to download. It’s impossible to find a actually free app that doesn’t spam you to pay money. I am going to tell all of my friends to give this app a 1 star hence all you want is my money. Btw I would feel less cheated if you had to pay off the bat instead of being a free app and realing me in then making me create an email account then answer 20 questions to just be asked pay a monthly subcrition........... ridiculous :((((((((((,I previously wrote a review about how Calm kept glitching out. I have a new phone, and that might contribute to it. They also might of fixed it. But, having the subscription - even not having it - the amount of content that is available to you is crazy. Every DAY there is something new and I am never bored with the app. They also have mediations and sleep stories narrated by a variety of celebrities. So overall, I love Calm.,It\\'s a great app with really helpful guided meditations. It\\'s helped me a lot. However, my one issue with it is that almost all the meditations are voices by Tamara Levitt, and while I\\'m sure she\\'s a wonderful person and does a great job writing the meditations, I honestly cannot stand her voice. It\\'s so nasally. I pretty much only listen to the meditations that she doesn\\'t do, which eliminates a lot of them. If they had a second voice option for every meditation, I\\'d 100% give the app five stars.,I don’t think I’ve ever written a review for an app before but it’s been a year since I downloaded Calm and it’s legitimately changed my life! Like a lot of people, I was in a pretty bad head space during quarantine 2020, decided to give meditation and this app a chance and between the daily Calms, the specific topic meditations, and the calming music options, I use this app every single day! Well worth the price if you can afford it!,Calm is honestly amazing and has helped me through many hard days.  The daily meditations are always great and only 10-12 minutes so you can fit them into your day, and there are cool journaling exercises and a mood check-in so you can do some self-reflection after the meditation.  Highly recommend to anyone who suffers from anxiety, depression, or just wants to get more into meditation at a beginner level.,The music, stories and meditations on this app are great. But it’s missing one huge feature IMO and that’s a sound fade with the timer. If you’re trying to gently doze off to sleep the sudden cutting off of music or a story is jarring. Ever woken someone up by turning off the tv who had fallen asleep watching? Yea same. The timer is helpful but I either turn it off myself before I fall asleep or it wakes me up when the timer is up. I’ve gone back to my old free app for white noise.,As someone who wants an accessible and easy way to meditate, listen to white or background noise, or just listen to sleep stories, Calm would be a great solution. I have actually downloaded this app once before, but I deleted it because there were too many locked items, meditations, and stories. Other than this significant issue, Calm is still great for if you just want to listen to background noise. I wish there were more things i have access to without having to pay so much.,In the last version the app stopped opening (is stuck on the “take a deep breath” screen). I read the recommendation to delete and reinstall it and intended to do so, but accidentally instead of deleting it removed it from my iPhone — but kept in the cloud. No I can neither open nor delete the app. When I open it from the list of my apps in App Store, it is still frozen — but there is no longer an option to “remove” it. And in my iPhone settings there is no such option either. What shall I do? I still have a few months of paid premium account, and being unable to use it is very disappointing!,I’ve had the app for a few years. It works great and has wonderful sleep stories and guided meditation. I just wish that the app had a few more free pieces than it does (it has about 3-4 free sleep stories and essentially no meditation). The yearly subscription is a pretty steep price for $100 per year. Even their deals feel expensive and it’s hard to know when they’re running a sale on subscription cost. In all though the app is great.,I love this app, it is such an incredible tool anytime I feel anxious, stressed, or overwhelmed. \\n PLEASE include a Daily Calm & Daily Trips tab under the meditations to have access to all of the daily calms. I think recently the creators included the recent daily calms but they go away and refresh after a little while which is awesome, but I would love to have access to the abundance of Daily Calms and Daily Trips! I love Jeff Warren so an abundance of Daily Trips would be so cool,I really like this app, it’s well laid out and easy to use. I’d like some new ASMR sleep stories, but otherwise I’d had alot of content to try. I generally use it to help fall asleep and love the sound scape and stories!\\n\\nI don’t like that it doesn’t work with Family Sharing. My daughter could really us it to help with sleep as well, but hate to spend $50/yr each. Adding a family member for $10 would likely get more income that making it an additional $50. \\n\\nKeep updating! Love the app!,For some people it takes more than 30 mins to fall asleep. Longer stories please and a function where you can set another story to start automatically one the first story is over. Otherwise you have to unlock your phone and click on another story which wakes you up and defeats the purpose. So please add an auto start feature where you can start another story of you aren’t asleep yet.,I’ve been using this app for about 1 1/2 years and it is wonderful!  The app is easy to navigate.  The choices of 30 minute mini audiobooks, loop-able soundscapes, and music selections cover a wide variety of genres.\\n\\nThe only improvement that I could ask for would be to add the ability to make a “sleep play list.”  Playing 3 or more sleep stories back-to-back would help me get into a deep sleep quicker.,i’ve been using this app for two days i think and i already like it. i’ve been doing the sleep meditations and i never get to finish them because i’ve already fallen asleep. I always would usually go to bed around 6 am and only get around two hours of sleep but now i am able to sleep at around 12am which is still late but way better. So if you have trouble sleeping dis is the app for you‼️,I have been a paying customer of this app for a few years now and while it’s a nice app, I had hoped that over the years it could expand the ways you can use it such as a ROKU app to allow it to be streamed on a larger screen like your tv.  Or allow it to be connected to Alexa so I can relax while I do dishes every night.  The visuals and the story are relaxing and I would love it on the TV or other speakers.  For how much I pay, I don’t enjoy that I’m stuck to using it on my little phone.  I’m considering cancelling the app for now but hope they at least make a ROKU tv app in the future.,Stress has been a big thing since last year, and thankfully I was able to get the free subscription through Kaiser. It is so so worth it. I was definitely starting to let myself fall into a bit of a depressed state, but this is such a wonderful app to take mental breaks, and even share with loved ones since socializing is so important! The check-ins, the music, meditations, stories, the sounds, everything about it... it’s great.,I surfer from very bad anxiety. To the point that my arms and legs go numb and chest pain. Headaches.  Sometimes even feel lie fainting. This application has definitely help and I see improvement in my attitude with the meditation and sleep sound effects. Like ( rain, snow, forest, ocean, etc.) I would recommend anyone to try this out even if its not because of anxiety, but simply to re-focus and relax your mind and body!. Definitely worth the money.,Calm is like one of the best things that help me calm down I could never doubt calm it helps me with depression and sadness it helps me with so much there is nothing bad I can say bad about this app you need to show calm some love tell family friends this is the most calming apps in the world I mean if your upset or need to calm down or need help going to sleep or really anything’s that it well calming get on this app I love this app 5 star most definitely,I’ve been using Calm for the two years since the unexpected death of my husband. It was the only thing that helped me return to a healthy sleeping pattern during the stress of losing him, being isolated by the pandemic and having to shutter my business for months. I continue to find new readers, stories and music that ease me to sleep, help me to sleep more deeply or return to sleep if I wake in the night. Calm has been a life saver for me.,I was severely depressed at my age 13. I have done something very bad a year ago, I have cryed almost every day of my life because of all the anxiety and guilt building up. I had suicidal thoughts even. Then I downloaded this app, and I got better in time. I learned to live in the present and focus on surroundings and what is happening in my present time. Without this app I would be dead. Thank you so much creators of calm,Falling asleep is the hardest part for me, much of the day is going through my mind.  When I listen to a sleep story, I don’t think of anything else. I always fall asleep without reaching the end, but that’s a good thing. I am biased though, my personal choice are the stories told by men but there are many narrators to choose from, lady’s and men, and they are all excellent.  I got a life time membership, it’s a wonderful way to fall asleep.   \\n\\nMaria,Love the app as part of my daily routine and mental health. Because of that, I find that it justifies the annual subscription fee. But the latest update has a bug where it app randomly opens and plays my selected background music. It’s quite annoying as it happens whenever I’m in the middle of something (like work) and I have to close the app. That method doesn’t work most times, so I’ve resorted to start a random session and pausing it.,I get that people need to make money and not everything can be free. I looked on the internet to find out if there are any meditation apps that are completely free. Calm showed up and I decided to give it another try. \\nI have used the calm app in the past (years ago) then deleted it because more and more stuff within the app became locked unless you bought the premium version. I downloaded it again to see if anything changed and literally almost everything is locked and requires you to pay. \\nI get it but it’s annoying that this app is being advertised as “free” when it is completely the opposite.,I love the sleep stories. My problem is staying asleep. The stories work great for getting back to sleep but when they end, there is silence. Could the silence be replaced with either another story or some calming rain sounds? I can manually make that switch but have to wake up again to do so.  I guess I need a constant distraction from my busy mind all night!  Thank you!,Amazing App.  Something for everyone and something for every situation.  It took me a year to buy it.  A year we will never get back.  The mindfulness sessions are amazing.  The background music, stunning.  My wife and I race each other to sleep now!  The stories, inspiring.  If you are wondering if the cost is worth it, wonder no more.  You won’t be sorry!  There is too much content here to regret this purchase.,I just had to write a review to say Thank you to the Calm App!! I listen to the sleep stories every night and sleep great. The most unexpected thing was learning so much about wonderful places I would never be able to go in real life!! I usually listen to a story and then go down an internet rabbit hole learning all about the history of some of the most fascinating places in the stories❤️ thanks so much!!,Love it… the only criticism I have is that it would be nice to have more bedtime stories that are actual stories.  Somehow listening to a narrative about someone walking down a path or a story that goes on about nothing is more frustrating and annoying than calming- at least that’s my opinion.  I will say Calm has way more actual stories than Headspace, which is why I use Calm- just wish there were more new ones.,I started Calm just over a year ago. When I started, my resting heart rate was 92, now it is 67. I am not as diligent as I’d like to be with it, but have learned, through practice, to give myself grace. Throughout this past extremely difficult year, I have grown in value, to myself & others, through learning & sharing. Having another tool in my toolbox, in which to appreciate life as the wonder it is.\\nThank you\\ndenise,This app has very useful guided meditations and soundscapes for getting to sleep, getting *back* to sleep, naps, and just relaxing in general. I do recommend.\\n\\nIf you want to sample the full paid content in the app there *is* a way to get a 1-month subscription to try it out (rather than jumping into a 1-year subscription), although it’s not publicized. Search the internet for more info.,they’ve locked all most all of the features to encourage users to pay for yearly membership fees. I did try premium for one year as a gift from a friend. Since it was one of my favorite apps for years, the premium membership was an awesome experience. Unfortunately, this is a luxury I can’t personally afford. So my heart sank just a little when I found out that there fewer free options now then when I started using the app. If you can afford it, I certainly liked the premium experience while it lasted.,I really love the Calm app and use it daily for my morning meditation and listening to the sleep meditation to help me fall asleep. If you are looking to cultivate a practice and simply sitting in silence is not working the Daily Calm series is a great way to build up momentum and start putting meditation into your daily routines. I have seen such wonderful benefits from this app and my meditation practice. Highly recommend.,This app is very well built and functions really well. There are few things I would like to recommend. \\n1. Add more content for sleep stories. \\n2. Add more content for mental fitness. \\n3. I honestly don’t like the authors faces on the tiles (nothing really wrong with them). I think if you add an icon which explains about the content rather than the author that would provide a better cue to click on them.,I have been using the daily meditation and sleep stories. My son heard a story and has been asking for one every night. The Glassmaker of Murano is a favorite! Haven’t looked into the other options but happy I have this option right now! Not too mention Calm teaming up with medical insurances to offer a free year. So nice to see mental health taken seriously. I’m really considering continuing using this app for my son and myself.,Literally my favorite sleep app. I love the kids bedtime stories, I’m 31, but they are so beautiful. I struggle to sleep and wake up in the morning but when I use this app I fall asleep within 10-15 min. And I am able to wake up on time in the morning. It’s honestly the best app ever. \\nOriginally Kaiser gave me free access for meditation but I just can’t get into it I’ve tried. The bedtime stories and sounds is amazing. \\nTotally recommend,Me, I\\'m Not a naturalist, tree hugger, health nut, etc. but...this meditation thing is amazing. Have only been at it a short while but have seen immediate benefits. The pandemic seems to have many people stressed, irritable, panicked, etc. Trying Calm has been very good for me. I would never have believed it possible. I\\'ve tried other things but Calm works for me. It is so comfortable. Worth a try for sure.,There is basically nothing in here free.  Virtually everything has a lock icon that tells you to do a free trial of premium.  They should just offer a subscription app outright, with a trial period.\\n\\nTheir bot is going to reply to this saying that there\\'s tons of free stuff, with a link to a webpage.  I won\\'t be surprised if even viewing that list itself requires a seven day trial.\\n\\nJust be honest, silly Calm people.  I\\'m willing to pay, I just want app makers to respect my intelligence and level with me that a subscription is required for most of the features listed in the description of the \"free\" version.,I truly don’t think I’ve found an app other than socials that I use as religiously. I’ve been a calm subscriber for over 2 years and love the range of content it provides. Although I wish they would add more variety to some sleep stories/meditations I still listen to them most nights and wake up with the daily calm meditations. It’s a little pricey, but I think we’ll worth the money.,This app was useless to me and even though I set an alarm to cancel before my trial was over, I was unable to cancel it due to an “error” until after i was charged and it took the entire Apple gift card I was given for Christmas. Even during the trial, the app never actually updated for me to use any of the premium content. Every thing was locked. I have zero desire to ever use this app again and I want my money back because I DID try to cancel before my trial was over and was unable to and I never even got to access anything that the upgrade was supposed to give me.,Calm is amazing! I sleep so much better now that I use it. So calming and relaxing. The thing is, it’s expensive. It’s 50 dollars for a year. And if you want to just buy it and not pay for it each year it’s $500 Thankfully there is some free stuff but there not as good as the locked stories. I would recommend this app especially if your having trouble sleeping. It also has calming music and work outs and all kinds of stuff. Highly recommended it. 👍,I have had the Calm app for a couple years now and I’m a little frustrated at the fact that things I used to listen to often are now locked and only available if you pay for a subscription. Almost everything is locked now and I feel like it’s no use having the app if I basically can’t use it. I can’t afford to pay for the subscription. I love this app but it’s a little frustrating how pressured I feel to have to buy the subscription.,While I don’t use the services often, this app notified me of my upcoming renewal and made it easy to cancel my premium membership. This is in contrast to many similar apps that make it all but impossible to cancel. The experience of a clean ‘cancel’ process makes me want to sign up again... I know that seems counterintuitive, but it does. \\n\\nThanks for a great product and treating customers ethically!,I have had the calm app for a about 3 years and what I have realized is I got this. Living in a chaotic, fast, stressful, distracting world can squeeze out all I have leaving me empty. The Calm app has taught me how to stay full and not to judge and hold on to my emotions. I don’t have to be perfect and that there are ways to handle anxiety, fear, sleeplessness and my over eating in healthy ways. I got this and it’s up to me to use these tools to a healthier me.,I got the app calm because I need better sleep j avoided getting it for so long g because something in my head said your a kid you don’t need help with anxiety and insomnia but that’s where I was wrong I’m up all night doing homework and stressing assignments I thought calm would help me sleep but after downloading I realized all of the sleep stuff costs money as mentioned before I am a minor so was unable to buy this without either getting in trouble or taken to a doctor for sleep and anxiety meds I got this app at night and it made me even more stressed please let me know if you make the sleep stuff free and I’ll try it again,I have trouble sleeping and seen a ad on tv about this app so I downloaded it and opened the app. It looked fine for the beginning then it gave me a pop up to unlock calm, (I don’t spend any money on apps) so I just simply pressed the (x) button I was brought to the home menu screen and did not realize how much stuff was locked with the free version. Like everything was locked...\\nOverall good app but you should really make some more stuff free on the app it’ll give people less things to stress out😉.,I just completed my first year of Calm and it is bar none the best app to save yourself. From early morning to drifting off to sleep there is something that fits your day. I love the Daily Calm minutes, motivational sessions and the most lush Sleep Stories (adore the line “we hope you never hear the ending” and I haven’t yet)! Thank you so much for this app, it is truly brilliant 🤙❤️,Went through a mental health crisis that left me with crippling anxiety( panic attacks at the slightest provocation) and situational depression. I bought a weighted blanket and started the meditations, sleep stories, and sound scapes. It’s been amazing. I’m finally able to fall asleep. The guided meditations help me slow down and deal with the mental health issues. It is a great tool to heal, but it is also great for people who just want to relax.,I have been a premium member now for at least 6 years........ I use it daily. For multiple reasons.... to obviously meditate, but to also listen to the music while I work or when I was studying....use it when I need to get away from the kids and husband for sure. My best excuse “mommy’s going to meditate.”  LOL. I love Calm and also try to get more and more people to use it......❤️❤️❤️,An example: my app doesn’t automatically update. Instead it just stops working. So I go to App and update - bear in mind I’ve paid $60 or so for this privilege just two months ago - and now rather than updating it just freezes. I close. I reopen. I reload. I try everything. Is there a number to call? An email? Any way to contact tech support? No. Folks, doesn’t really matter how calm the app is when it consistently does this crap. I guess I will have to call my credit card company and see if they can seek a refund since Calm won’t honor letting one pay through Apple.,The opening admonition to ‘Take a deep breath’ is almost comically on the nose because, while it’s true that the app has lots of lovely calming content (honest kudos for that), the performance of the app is so ridiculously poor that you have to literally take a deep breath in order to maintain patience while you wait for screens to switch and for the app to finish going where it wants to go, rather than where you want it to go. Content is great, bu the app functionality needs a ton of work.,Yes, I am putting down my favorites on the list, however there are a couple of things I wish I could have. One is a timer on all the stories, I only see a timer on the sleep stories. The other is that on the sleep stories there are a lot of talk on it. For instance, on the Jazz one, I wish to hear the music and less talk. Some apps are enjoyable with their stories but sometimes you just want the music (with the timer on). I like my Abide app it always has a timer so when I sleep so does the app.,This app is supposed to calm you right? When I went into that app, I wanted to listen to a story to make myself fall asleep. But this STUPID app made me get a vip/subscription/premium thing so I can listen to the story. So I went to a different story and that was locked too. I did the vip/subscription/premium thing and it still didn’t work. I had it, so I could listen to a story, but it was still locked. The people who made this app are greedy for money and it’s full of glitches too. I gave it 2 stars because I’m sure that this app COULD be good if it wasn’t filled with glitches.,I’ve got multiple disabilities. One of my biggest problems is not being able to fall asleep and stay asleep.  Doctors have prescribed meds but I don’t want to become addicted. I don’t even care for taking the Melatonin, so one night I tried “Calm”. It took some time, and in the beginning, some Melatonin, but now, I stay plugged in all night and sleep like a baby.,The only reason I gave this app three stars was because nearly everything on this app has to be payed for. Really, seventy dollars a year just for a sleeping and meditating app? The only reason that I got this app was because of my sleep problems, and I can only get three to four sleep stories without premium. You may as well make people pay for the app, not for the membership! \\n   Can you please make some changes and unlock more sleep stories? That’s all I want.,I get this app free through my health insurance, which is the only reason I have premium. I love the sleep stories, and really wish I could do the meditations, however I cannot handle Tamara Levin’s voice (vocal quality and intonation). I believe she is one of the founders or creators of Calm so I really admire her work, but in order to use the meditations effectively we need a soothing voice. Please please fix this issue. I’ve seen multiple reviews saying the same thing.,This is a great app. The free version gives you enough to begin. Later on you may want the extra content but the free version is awesome on its own. Included with the free app is a 7 day training program to teach you the basics. I have the premium version. My only complaint is I wish they would add a playlist feature so I can make a custom group of sleep stories that add up to the amount of minutes I generally need to fall asleep.,I quit using calm because I found a number of other free meditation apps that I liked. Next thing I know I had a renewal charge on my credit card for Calm. My problem is not with the quality of the app. My problem is with the fact that they don’t email you in advance to remind you of an upcoming renewal. Most apps provide this courtesy. So now I’m stuck paying $70 for something I’m not using. I tried to email them but they did not reply.,There is almost no free content. One of the most frustrating apps I’ve ever downloaded because you literally can’t even try it out because everything is locked. Listen this app is not free. There is essentially nothing of any value that isn’t locked. There’s some stupid sleep series. You literally can’t find anything else that is not locked. This is not a freemium app this is a straight up pay app that should be charged for from the get go because there is nothing free here of any value. Anyone that says that simply not the case is simply wrong.,Mindfulness rules!  We came high told everyone who needed to know and we took a Happy Ending!!!  Your sacrifices were not in vain, not only did we take a Happy Ending, but we took the best existence. You didn’t need to know, we end suffering for everyone. The biggest Enemy gets the biggest sacrifice. We’re going to come up off these huge enemies who need huge sacrifices.  Everyone gets the advantage!!!,Calm is far and away, my daily go-to for meditation and has often single handedly gotten me through the stress of being a mom, wife, sister, daughter and friend during the pandemic. And it works like magic to help my two boys, ages 9 and 12, when they need to reset their anxiety level. The sleep stories for kids are one of the best kept secrets out there. Every aspect of Calm is top notch.,I downloaded the Calm app to get into a meditation routine and it worked. There are many good series that I would return to, but over time I had listened to most three or four times, and aside from single Daily meditations there was not a lot of new (meditation) content to consume. Having only one narrator/voice as your guide is also limiting when that voice is not one that sits well in your ears (personal preference, I know). Amazing app to get into a meditation habit but not enough to keep me subscribed.,I know that’s a dramatic claim for someone who has only had the app for 4 days but truly - I’m starting not to dread going to bed anymore. I have routinely been falling asleep ok - then am wide awake at 2.30 - lying there worrying about everything under the sun. I have only used the stories so far but they work perfectly! I have had the best 4 nights sleep I can recall since buying the app!,Calms my very soul. Try the 7 days of anxiety. \\n\\nBedtime stories I enjoy falling off to sleep with a story. Usually,  I can’t get to sleep now, I wake up hours later and realize I fell to sleep. I listen to another story to clear my mind of everything. It helps me fall !back to sleep which is a big deal I have severe insomnia. \\n\\nCokey Tapper,Calm has become a huge part of our lives. We listen to the sleep stories together as a family almost every night. The stories are perfect for kids and adults. The voices of the narrators are calming and relaxing. I can’t say enough good things about this app and don’t know what we’d do without it. It’s truly become apart of our nighttime ritual and apart of our family.,Wow.  Just wow. I came to this app to help with my insomnia since my medication stopped helping.  You have to buy everything.  I found two free stories and that was it. They try so hard to make you buy premium but I can’t spare the money for it. There isn’t a free section for free stories and even when you search free nothing free comes up.  It’s very annoying and if there were some that could be added it would be amazing. I would recommend it to plenty but it’s only for the crowd who wants to spend money on something like this.,This app has helped more in the past year than years of therapy ever did — COVID-19 pandemic (and working from home) notwithstanding. I started with relaxing music, then tried other items offered on the app. I took up a simple 10-minute meditation daily and have noticed I’m so much more at peace internally. I could never have imagined it would make such a difference. Thank you, Calm!,Between chronic neck pain and just plain restlessness, I’m pretty used to not sleeping that great. With Calm, I am sleeping much sounder.  Just put on a soundscape and I instantly feel calmer. \\nI also struggle with my mind racing when I’m trying to fall asleep. I started listening to meditations before my sound scape... it’s been helping my mind calm down! Love this app! \\nI look forward to going to sleep so I can relax and be peaceful!,Hello Christi from Calm. I rarely if ever buy an app. The reason...I don’t trust anyone who advertises a discount but makes you click a link to find out how much the price is. First it’s a free app, then ah, it’s only free for a week. If you don’t sign up then you get the email that tells you OMG can you believe this...there is a discount of 50%...not of what...just 50%. If you click on the link to see the price I bet it’s the full price but how would anyone know what that was. Reject the gift then there is another gift, how about 13 months instead of 12. \\n\\nReally...do you think??? Bet you sleep good at night counting the greens,,I’ve been actively using this app for two years now. This got me through some of the most traumatic situations in my life. I cannot appreciate this app enough. Everything I need for my severe anxiety, sadness, and stressful situations. This app is my go to when I am in a bad spot. Even when I’m happy this app just teaches me how to live a better life. Can’t imagine what life was like before this app.,Calm has gotten me to sleep in at least 5 minutes each night, I have a lot of anxiety about things and the stories are so peaceful!! There’s a different story for everyone and calm has it all, from sounds of rain to 45 minute stories! This is an amazing app(in my opinion) and there variety is amazing!! I love this app and would highly recommend it to everyone. :),It’s good! But there nothing you can do without paying 70 dollars a year and  unlocking that. So every things locked unless you pay for it. I only found,like, two things that are not locked. But i might buy the unlocking thing or delete it. But it seems like a amazing app! It helps with lots of stress. So if your up to paying 70 dollars a year, you can get the best out of it!!!!,I’ve used the Calm paid version for two years. I’ve noticed in the past year that the app has become political.  If I’m going to allow someone to guide my subconscious mind, I need to feel safe with the meditations.  More often this past year the meditations start by reminding people how stressful the world is or how divisive politics are. I have deleted the app because I don’t like having to anticipate what stressful news topic will be brought up next.  Calm should be a haven and safe space, not a reminder of all the chaos.,I love this app! I use it every single night to help fall asleep. If I need to wind down I usually listen to the deep sleep with the soothing voice of ms. Tamara. I love to listen to the thunderstorm soundscape. It is my absolute favorite. My only suggestion is to have more thunder in the thunderstorm. This is more like rain with an occasional clap of thunder. I am so blessed that my insurance company covers the cost of the app.,Hello I am currently nine years old right now and this is just a waste of time and I do not like it for starters everything wants you to buy anything and everything I hate it it’s a waste of time and I would not like to ask my mom for all of this crap but on the bright side it did kind of help me understand meditation more but none of my anxiety has been released at all so please take this in and help me out here by stopping all this money I don’t wanna give you any of my money but I’m just mad at this app I am mad at whoever made this,I use Guided Meditations almost exclusively for sleep. All but a few of Calm’s offerings of sleep meditations are with one hypnotist, whose voice is grating to me. It may as well be nails on a chalkboard when I hear her voice. I had the premium subscription but will be canceling it. After 2 years of it, I hoped they would expand their offerings but it hasn’t happened and doesn’t look like they’re changing that anytime soon. Switched over to the Slumber app instead and much happier with that one. So far, they add guided meditations weekly.,Literally has in my opinion saved me!Even though this sounds ridiculous I overdosed on marijuana on April 2020 and since then I have found meditation because what happened was it threw me into panic and anxiety attacks. And before I had a diagnosis from a doctor I found meditation and have been doing it since and it has saved my life I’ve been a blessing in every sense of the word,I really wish I had done more research on all the meditation apps before I purchased Calm. The majority of the guided meditations are from Tamara, the “Head of Mindfulness at Calm.” I personally do not find her voice soothing, and have had difficulty finding other meditations on the app that are not guided by her. It is such a well known platform, I would expect it to be more expansive, and have more teachers available on it. I have found other platforms way better. Very disappointed in the app overall,I found more and more from Calm each year I’ve used it.  Had it for 2 years now.  Last 2 years my work has been stressful with travel and family.  The daily managing of stress alone has helped mind, plus body.  Body in so much of assisting in quality of sleep, heartburn, etc,...  Hidden anxiety taking a toll on the physical self.,I pay for this app and it’s expensive. I try to use it all the time but the last two updates have been absolutely horrific. It crashes on me multiple times a night so I just gave up and went to another site. Now after this latest update it won’t even open past the “take a deep breath” screen 😡😡😡  I’m REALLY dissatisfied with how glitchy and slow it is. I pay a lot of money for this app but if they don’t fix the crashing issues I’m canceling. It’s appalling that my 80+ dollars app won’t work. 😡😡😡😡,The voices are calming, very soothing but ONLY around 30 mins long. You have to KEEP coming out of your rest to look for a new story. \\n  I find after 2 or 3 times doing this, I am frustrated and now fully awake turning to something else to put me to sleep. Now I also have the problem dealing with the anger of not getting TO SLEEP.\\n Make the stories a minimum of an hour please.,This app was a lifesaver for me. As a registered nurse working on a Covid unit I was pretty much at the end of my rope. I used Calm all day every day!!! I used it to get me through my day and to help me sleep. It was worth every penny. I had never been much for meditation, but just putting the screen on the ocean with soothing sounds while I charted helped me immensely. I could go on and on, highly recommend this app.,I’ve had this wonderful app for over a year. I have practice yoga most of my life with meditation at different times of my life but more regularly now. \\n\\nMy only thought regarding Calm is sometimes I wish the meditations were a little longer.... the silence and the breathing. Of course this is something I do on my own but I enjoy the Calm guided meditations with words of wisdom! \\nThank you!,If you’re looking for a patronizing wu-wu ramble to make you question meditation all together, you’ve come to the right place. Inane fast-food wisdom combined with the effected, breathy voice of the narrator, Tamara, is sure to cause the listener to be less calm and more annoyed than when they started. A session on this app feels less like meditation than it does a solo-podcast with an air headed host looking to sell her line of healing crystals.  The app would be improved by replacing Tamara with literally anyone that doesn’t sound like they’re trying to push salvia on elementary school kids.,Bringing up two sons who idolize any sport with a ball in it I would also need to learn the super stars they would follow mentally as well as physically.  LeBron James can also help this 71 year old caucasian woman who would like to channel her\\nenergy in a more positive way.  it’s difficult to get older and not have those two boys to chase all over God green earth.  Thank you for your words.,With the addition of the amazing Jeff Warren, on the daily trip I am now back to listening to my calm app every night!When I started listening to the calm app I did his 30 days of meditation along with several sleep teachings and meditations, and have made great strides in my ability to relax, focus, sleep better. I am a therapist who highly recommends this app to all my clients.,This app helped me through a true hard time worth the money in my opinion, the music is great sleep stories, self help readings by all different people help lift moods and get you thinking on a new perspective. There are also children options with stories music and meditation, I used the sleep stories with my kids a few times and it definitely did the trick.,My meditation practice needs improvement & so working with CALM is very helpful.  Like the self check-in, the tracker I can use to “plan” and assess my mediation practice and the content of the 10-12 minute sessions.  I really miss going to live yoga classes during COVID & listening to a real person guide through mediation via CALM in the comfort of my own home is great.  Thank you for creating these sessions!,I use the daily meditation to start my day. It’s made a huge difference in my mental well-being. Tamara has a soothing voice - makes it easy to listen. My kids and I love the sleep stories - we listen to one almost every night. I have also used the meditations related to calming anxiety - they’ve been especially helpful during this pandemic.,I used to have a lot of trouble sleeping and calming my thoughts during stressful moments. Now Calm is my GO TO the second I’m feeling anxious or in need of some calming comforting breaths. They have an incredible selection of content and I’m particularly a fan of their bedtime stories :) their bedtime stories make you feel like a kid again but in the most adult way possible☺️,My iPhone screen will shut off and normally music will still play but with this app, nope. It will for two days then I have to reinstall it to get it to work again. I googled it and this is a common problem with no fix other than reinstalling the app. The developers have some serious kinks to work out. This is a fabulous app and to have it work so poorly is sad considering my insurance is providing this to me for anxiety. Get it together calm!,I’m enjoying the app so far. I’ve tried the free trials and trying to justify the price tag of daily use. \\n\\nAs I dig deeper into the app, I am finding it more useful and finding more ways to be present and experience mindfulness. \\n\\nI’m giving it four stars because I see where it could use more content, however, that could change over time. I’m very pleased with the content that I have explored so far.,I went to the website and tried to sign up for a basic membership or trial but the site literally will not let you \\nIt skips over basic membership and charges you $65 for a year to try it and then  says it won’t refund Any of your money and that you have to contact apple support and beg them for a refund and maybe apple will refund and Maybe not \\n\\nThe same two ppl narrate pretty much everything I tried on the app and the woman Tamara’s voice is extremely annoying \\nI can’t meditate to that \\nI tried to get a refund and there’s no way to contact anyone so think twice before you spend 65 dollars to try something because YOU CAN NOT GET REFUND \\nI will be calling credit card company tomorrow to do a charge back \\nI used the app for about 30 minutes so I think a month charge would be fair but nope it’s $65 . It’s a scam to force you into a year membership and that tells ne the company is dishonest,I love this app. The only thing to improve is that I use it with my headphones and all my text notifications are read by Siri while I’m meditating. I wish this app had the ability to block notifications while in use because some people like to send five texts in a row and keep pestering until they get a reply.,I saw a Calm advertisement on TV at the beginning of the pandemic. I’d been feeling the need to center myself in general so it appealed to me. Little did I know how much it would affect my life in such a powerful way physically (lower blood pressure), mentally and spiritually! This app offers so much. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to sit with themselves and grow. Tamara Levitt is awesome!! I am grateful that I discovered Calm!💐,When I first saw an ad on calm saying that it could help me fall asleep I said I’ll check it out when I got onto the app I saw that I had to pay for some thing and I was like OK I’m not gonna pay for it when I got to fully into the app all of the things were locked and only miniature items were not and that was very stressful now I have to pay $70 for me to unlock all of the things on the app and makes no sense and then you only gave us 7 days  to have it free I give a bad review because that is entirely messed up.,I am always feeling stressed and have lots of anxiety but when I come on to this app it just releases it and put it in a jar and ship far away forever and that feeling is just so inspiring and amazing so I want to bless all of you and I want to be able to wish that this app will help you just like it is helping me. I hope you have a wonderful day  \\n\\nGod bless you🙏😊,To be able to stop and see what I have done throughout the day, and stop. Where did I start, where am I, and where am I headed?\\n\\nIt really is rather simple, and can bring much joy to the day. So rather than letting myself become tense, angry, or unhappy; just let me take a few moments of the day, and rebalance the rest of today.,Just on site for a few hours..the most calming videos, pictures, beautiful scenery, fascinating content throughout. Insightful to the extreme . Never seen such amazing clarity flying above clouds, incredible waterfalls, waves, storms, lakes, beautiful raindrops gently falling on reacting leaves, enough already. I’ve almost reached transcendence , just want to spread the wisdom and love to family and trusted friends. Enjoy, best investment I’ve ever made.,I wanted to try it but I can’t  because no matter what I try to listen to in any category I get a message to try it free for 7 days BUT I have to submit my credit card to even try it.  It’s very expensive at $70 a year for a student or a senior on a fixed income.  I’m not willing to give my credit card and get stuck with an auto bill. If they really were willing to try a free trial they would offer free access and at end of 7 days let person know they have to purchase to continue to use the app. Developer won’t even do monthly fee just a year.,I don’t write reviews but I needed to for this. Tamara and the rest of the readers they have on here are just phenomenal. They’ve truly saved me during the pandemic and have helped make me a better, more aware individual. The Daily Calm is an essential daily ritual and the payoff for those few minutes is invaluable. Couldn’t recommend this with any more enthusiasm.,I don’t know if Tamara changed her audio equipment, but her voice is more tinny and burgeoning on vocal fry.  Tamara had a very relaxing, velvety smooth voice when the app started.  I don’t like to be critical and say this only to be constructive...we know the British accent sounds cool and all, but please also stop the newly acquired weird accent. It is distracting and you don’t need to do it. Be yourself.,I downloaded this app to help me sleep and it didn’t help at all because you are aloud to listen to one story without the premium and with the premium you have some of them it is so stupid that calm has done this don’t download this app!!!!!! I only gave it five stars so then you would be able to see this comment! DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT’S A RIPOFF,I purchased a gift subscription for a family member. It has been a nightmare to then actually be able to gift it to her! The” Help and Support “ tab steps as how to do this isn’t what actually happened. And trying to find an actual phone number to speak to someone with Calm on the app is impossible. Not happy.,I love this app! It’s such a game changer. My favorite sleep story is the one with Harry Styles. I love the music and poem style story - also it’s pretty long (40+ min) which is great. I really would like to see more poems like this one on the app. There’s something soothing about drifting off to sleep with the rhythm of the rhyming. Hopefully Calm can keep growing and expanding their story styles/genres.,The answer is yes. I swear this app is 80% responsible for my ability to function during this pandemic. I love the sleep stories, soundscapes, and music to work to. The pink noise is like a massage for your brain. 10/10 recommend. I will definitely continue paying for this app once my year of a free trial through Kaiser Permanente has been completed.,I used to work for a wellness app and I’ve been searching for another app to replace it with. I tried Calm in hopes it would meet my needs but it’s not a great fit. Mainly because I want to listen to programs while I’m multitasking. I want to listen in the car, or on a walk, or while I’m working but every program asks you to close your eyes and clear your mind which is probably great for a lot of people but it isn’t what I need. I want to use my time to get self-care while I’m doing some other often mundane task.,I’ve had this app for a few years and I like the variety of sounds and the fact that they turn off after a few hours, which is why I would give in 4 starts. Lately it’s been going off in the middle of the day or over night randomly. The app is closed and my phone will say I’m playing nothing, super weird.,I just subscribed today and was surprised to see that they’ve opted out of making their subscription eligible for Family Sharing.  In their FAQ they give the reason for this as they “are still working to develop the best experience possible for families who share Calm with each other.”  Family Sharing works pretty well, Calm.  Just go with that.  There’s no way we’re purchasing multiple $70 annual subscriptions, so I may not commit after my free trial is up.,Just what I needed to start making daily habits of the healthy practices I’d been dabbling in. It’s beautiful, soothing and inviting. Gives me gentle prompts to meditate and reflect. Suggests meditations so I don’t have to go scrolling through a menu or remember to set things up in advance. It provides the structure and encouragement I needed to make a daily habit of meditation.,I really wish there was more options for people using calm that do not have the subscription, because most of my favorites are locked. Sometimes when I want to listen to a body scan or a meditation session, it’s locked and I can’t enjoy the things I like about the app. Nevertheless this app is truly a wonderful release after a long day of school or work.,I use the CALM app for sleep stories at night and daily morning meditation. I also love the focus music options during work periods. Just recently I lost a colleague and the grief stories were so helpful. I have also enjoyed the daily reflections snd quotes. In a fit of anxiety , the emergency breaths are an indispensable resource. I don’t know what I would do without the CALM app!,I mostly use Calm for the Sleep Stories.  They really do help with my sleep.  I don’t like the daily Calm, for some reason I find the narrators voice really irritating   I’ve tried over and over and can’t stand her voice and delivery (Tamara) \\nI have listened to some of the visitor meditations and like them better. \\nI would like more new sleep stories.  I really like the ones about travel.  Eric Braa is my favorite his voice is soothing.  \\nI’d like to hear more chapters of Treasure Island!  \\nLynne W,I’m finding artists and collections of sounds that surpass classical music when the spirit needs rest. The visuals are done well for an app. In one app I find relaxing instrumentals with and without nature’s music, meditations and peace. I am enjoying your selections.\\n \\n    Artists that I am familiar with are putting music on Calm that reveal how much they resonate with the new age. Thanks for all your efforts.,I found the site did not provide enough substance for the cost; so then I tried to cancel before the trial date ended; The site made it absolutely impossible to cancel and then immediately charged me a FULL year subscription without any notice. I think this is the most fraudulent set up and con job imaginable. Lure people in, make it impossible to stop and then bill them for a year of service with absolutely no way to get out of their fraudulent contract. Such a scam.,I like this app a lot. It has nice features such as being able to set reminders for different things (daily check-ins). The worst part about this app is that almost all of the really cool features and options you must “unlock” by paying for a subscription. I do not pay for it, and therefore have limited access to what I can actually do on the app. I’d much rather the app just have a one-time-fee to access all parts of the app.,This was the 3rd app I downloaded for relieving stress and I was crossing my fingers. But sadly, everything you have to buy. Most of the things are locked.🔒 I really wished this wasn’t another app that gauges you for money, I was very disappointed. It looked like a very useful app. I just don’t wanna pay more money for a stress reliever app. I still gave it four stars, but I won’t continue to use this app. 😕,I only use Calm for the sleep stories for which I would give almost 5 stars. I’ve tried the meditation and some of the other things, but find them grating and triggering. I don’t care for the main woman’s voice all over the app, but love the diversity of the stories voices. I have some favorites who have deep, soothing voices. The price is a bit steep for just stories that are only updated maybe twice a month, so I’d love a Sleep Stories only app.,Love this app, it has helped me very very much.  The only thing I would like to see different is the ability to have unlimited favorites.  When I keep adding favorites it knocks some of them out of my list cause there is a limited number you can use.  Other than that, I could not be without this app.  Love it!!!,I love love love calm. It helps me sleep every night and I love all of the guided meditations. I would like to suggest being able to queue up sleep stories, and sort by length. It takes me a while to settle in, and sometimes I need to put on a second sleep story, but the light from my phone/ interaction with the app takes me out of my sleepiness.,Daily Calm provides many teachers and many modes of working one’s awareness.  It would be impossible to spend enough time to explore it all and still do one’s regular life! The graphics and photos are gorgeous and the music also.  I’m especially grateful for the basics taught by Jeff Warren which got me to set a habit and stay curious.,I used this app for free when my baby was born to play lullabies, help with post partum insomnia and keep our sanity. I used to listen to one of the tracks called Milky Way- it was my favorite. These were free and required no trial or purchase. It’s all I wanted and guess what, those are LOCKED now. Very disappointed. Some people have a budget and can’t afford the full version but now there is nothing left at all to use -even for free- even things that were once free within the app. Will be uninstalling and hoping Bored Panda will be enough for me and the baby to sleep.,I do really love this app. Just wanted to point out that in your 7 days of gratitude meditation there is a part about being grateful for your eye sight because not everyone has it. Please be aware that blind folks are able to access/use this app and it’s inappropriate ableist language. Maybe update the language in that one. Otherwise fantastic and calming, grounding app.,Calm is a very overwhelming app. For a place that one is supposed to go to for relaxing, it has caused me anxiety on several occasions because I\\'m not sure where to go within the app. There are too many things going on and too many categories.\\nThe content is the best in the world but there is so much to sift through before picking something.\\nI really wish the app gets re organized into simpler categories for someone to easily navigate and find what they need.,I have listened to 336 hours on the Calm app. I absolutely love it. But the newest update is horrible! It’s hard to find my favorites, and when I do.... it shows maybe 5. The new layout just feels like chaos and I much preferred the last one. It’s hard to search through now and I barely open my app anymore. I used to use it every single night but I’m just THAT annoyed with the stinking layout. Not sure if I’ll renew my subscription,I love Calm and the content they offer is great, but the app needs an overhaul. It launches and runs slowly, and it drains my phone and iPad batteries quickly while it’s open. Navigation could use some work too. The competing apps do not suffer these issues. I have resorted to using Calm from the web browser. It’s a better experience. I have raised my concerns about app performance to customer service, and they didn’t seem to care.,Your app is not working. It’s been frozen like this all morning. \\n\\nIt’s stuck on the opening page that says, “Take a deep breath”. Ok. And...?\\n\\nFrustrating.\\n\\nCalm seems to be having a lot of issues. It’s crashed quite a bit from time to time. It’s slow to load... The unreliability doesn’t only mean it’s not usable when I need it, it’s also aggravating, esp. after repeated failed attempts to use the app. \\n\\nDoesn’t help that Calm doesn’t make it easy to reach out for help or even to provide feedback. \\n\\nThe irony: I’m finding myself annoyed when I’m looking to the app to get to a place of calm & relaxation. \\n\\nThis is not what Premium members signed up to pay for.  Are you even aware of the problem? Are you fixing it?,Instead of reading a lengthy book to learn how to meditate, Calm lets you learn in small chunks, AS you practice.\\n\\nConsistent practice is the key to getting the benefits of mindfulness meditation. Calm helps you stay on track with that as well.\\n\\nI use it and I’ve bought lifetime subs for myself and my daughter. Cant give higher praise than that.,I really love the app. One thing I wish could change is the “time played out of app”. It goes from nothing (0 minutes) to 15 minutes. I wish there was a 5 minute option. It’s like right when the meditation is done boom you’re done. Kind of jarring. But the 15 minutes is just to long for those using this before getting ready for work.,Calm’s sleep stories has been wonderful for helping me sleep but the app is missing really basic features like playlists or search. Would love the ability to play a playlist of multiple in a row. Often I wake up when one ends but then when I start another, my husband wakes up. There should also be a way to search for stories by the same person.,Everyone that teaches on calm are all helpful and amazing. I have no regrets with buying this app, this has helped me through tons of life issues that has built up.  \\nI want to thank Jeff Warren in particular for helping with life situations he is by far one of my favorites on calm. \\n\\nThankyou calm for helping all of us get through hard times.,Be very careful that they would try to sneakily charge your subscription fee without any notice. No email reminder of upcoming subscription renewal, and very hard to find where to cancel the subscription. And of course, couldn’t find anywhere to submit the request for a refund. I will work with the credit company to get my money back but just want to leave a comment to warn other users, they are definitely trying hard to not make you aware of your upcoming payment. Horrible customer service.,Received free year and didn’t realize they would automatically renew.  Tried it a couple of times but it added nothing to my meditation practice so deleted app.  Received notice today that the subscription renewed with no notice. You are expected to track it.  Unsubscribed after the fact and there is no way to get my money back as far as I can tell. disgusted.  Stuck with a subscription I won’t use and haven’t used for almost the entire year.  Sleazy.,I fall asleep to this all the time! I love this app! I’d give it a 5 star rating! Everyone is says “I need new voices!” But the voices are fine! I think there pretty and calming. And my favorite voice is Tamara Levitt. Her voice is just so soothing 😌 And over all I don’t think there should be anything to fix. This is an amazing app! You guys should get it! ❤️\\n☺️\\n🙏,I have loved this app and use it daily for several years and have given it as gifts... Now when I try to get in I am able to login and then I get this advertising business and wanting me to sign up again ...what is going on I wanted to go to bed and listen to a sleep story this is ridiculous ????,Stuck at take a deep breath screen. Same as everyone else. \\n\\nNot sure why they’re handling this individually and having people contact support as this is a universal problem with the latest update. \\n\\nAs a premium subscriber for over 4 years now (probably longer) I’d appreciate a dev response to everyone on steps their taking (or at least an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT the problem exists?!) calm is usually very good about issues that have come up in the past so I’m a little surprised at the lackluster or completely lacking response.,I think this app is a nice way to get a lot of stuff off your mind, but i am not old enough to spend money on premium, so almost EVERYTHING cost’s money when it really should not, i get that you need to make money, and i understand, But mabye for premium just make less things cost money, or mabye get rid of it all together? Because i have listened to almost every sound and story on here, and there is a lot more.,Literally have to pay to listen to anything other than like 4 stories per section. Why advertise that it’s free if it’s literally an app where you have to pay (according to a paying customer of yours) 5 dollars a month if you’re gonna make people pay that much a month why not just make the whole app accessible with a purchase of just 5 dollars I’d rather this be a free app with ads on the sidelines than an app where you have to be constantly paying to use it when it’s advertised as free. Wish I could give it 0 stars,Seems like a full exaggeration of my part. Have been suffering of anxiety from some time ago. \\n\\nYes, I tried meditate from myself but it was close of the guidance and direction and training this app gave to me. Tamara Levitt and Jeff Warren have been part of my wake up morning every day since October 2020. Time for Meditation It is a must in every one life.,So often in this day and age companies practice D&I by going no further than adding images of diversity to their website, app.   But when I open their content diverse voices absent. So I move on and rarely use the Calm app that I have free for one year from Kaiser because the voices all sound the same and I get the impression that the diverse voices are not being hired. Mostly white male or female. Nothing wrong but I want to have a choice to hear voices that is a reflect my culture, my needs, my soul.,I’ve been using this app for almost 2 years. I enjoy the daily meditations except for the narrator Tamara Levitt. Her tone is condescending and patronizing, plus she can’t stop talking. She’s a huge distraction. She does a good job of writing the meditations, but Calm needs to find other mediation leaders. Come on Calm give us a choice for daily meditation.,I have no idea how I got cornered into buying an entire year’s subscription for an app I don’t want or use. The so-called music is worse than being in an elevator or on hold with a customer service line - insipid and soulless are the words that come to mind and I am personally surprised that some of the musicians I admire actually put their names on here. Of course it’s impossible to cancel if you purchased via iTunes etc. and now I learn that it would have been free as a Kaiser member - would have been nice if they asked that at the very beginning!,I started using this app when it first came out. I thought I’d try out the subscription and accidentally purchased the lifetime version (good til 3017!?) for a womping $300+ one-time payment! I was intending on paying like $2-3 MAX. I contacted the app and trying fixing the issue and they never responded. Mind you, the app is mediocre at best. The paid for app isn’t really any better than the free version. I’ve only used it a handful of times since 2017...but I’m stuck apparently. For forever. I feel the opposite of calm using it now.,The Calm App has helped me deal with anxiety. I  enjoy all the different applications. Easy to use and very key for people who have never meditated. I also love the sleep stories for those nights when you need some help falling asleep. I use it everyday at least 3 or 4 times. It is essential to my well being.\\nMarTorres,Calm app- has been along this journey of mines when it comes to anxiety, stresses of life, depression etc. I’m still learning but with the help of meditation and just truly existing in the present and not being so hard on myself (which I can be) this app has been so helpful! Thankful to have come across this app when I did 🦋,Calm is a great app it got me asleep in seconds but everything is premium like the free stuff theirs only one episode of the whole thing that is free. I want to save money but it’s kinda ridiculous that I only get one episode out of like 40 episodes. But I love the app I just wish it wasn’t all premium. \\n\\nThanks \\nBy Jake,While I love the content the app crashes when I am listening to sleep stories. Had to restart stories 4 times last night. Kinda defeats the purpose don’t you think? I went from five stars to three because of this problem. I cannot find a way to communicate with you other than a review. \\n\\nHere’s hoping you read these reviews and fix the problem soon.\\n\\nThank you,I absolutely love this app but there are some improvements that could be made. \\n\\n1. Why can’t you favorite a sleep story or meditation without playing it first??\\n2. Why can’t you cue up sleep stories? On Apple Music you have the option to select “play next” on songs, it would be nice if sleep stories had something similar..,Everyday they have a different topic for guided meditation that always ties into something that we all struggle with on life. The guided meditations are helpful. They also have some for children and a variety of other topics. I haven’t delved into them all but this is a pretty good app for all the hype it was given during the pandemic by Kaiser staff.,When I said in silence and do my breathing exercise I feel better mobility to talk and speak a whole sentence become better and clear my mind is better my reflexes silence played a big part in my life this morning today is the first day that I’ve taken out walking I walk two blocks and back home,I pretty much have a streak of listening to the same sleep story every night but let’s ignore that fact and I have to say, this app is amazing, I wake up with good thoughts in my head and a great dream last night because of the things your stories make me think about! Thx so much!!!,So I love this app, but there is something that needs to change. First of all I would like to point out that the per year amount is way to expensive (well to me). Also that with everything you can do, you must have premium. Which is unfair. I would like if there is more options then just your scene with the sounds...🙃\\n\\nBut overall it’s a good app.,After a serious issue with my back and legs and a few anxiety and panic attacks along with the worry I decided to get into meditation and stick with it this time. I have done that and the results have been exhilarating. I look forward to taking the time for myself and the guidance from CALM has been great.,I was trying this out for my Psychiatrist.  I love the options of sounds/backgrounds on your main page.  Basically everything I clicked after that required a subscription so...  I’m going to have to report back to not recommend.  We’re Cancer patients. Since everything I click on to try out requires signing up a credit card.  We out.  If in the future you offer anything on the free app I’d be happy to review again but as of now this is a failure and waste of time,Calm you are my five star sleep routine for myself and my whole family. However, when I updated to this version all I get is a blue screen telling me to take a deep breath. Yeah, not fixing the bugs. Luckily my husband hasn’t updated his app so we can still access for now. Please fix!,I have so enjoyed the meditations but now they are becoming political.  I just want to meditate, be present in the moment, listen to peaceful sounds, focus on positive, encouraging words and try to sleep or refresh. \\n\\nWe all have our needs for identity and our battles to fight but can’t we just be human beings who need to rest or regroup for a few minutes without feeling even meditations are fomenting causes and agendas? Disappointing!,I really enjoy the app. I think something that should be changed is, please add some free things. I understand that there aren’t many (or no) ads so you have to pay, but I think there should be a few free things in each category (meditation,music, etc.) but please leave the check ins for free😅. Other than that, it’s a great app!! 🤍🤍🤍,My mom sometimes puts on a calm story for me and my brother. That is where I first heard of calm. This app helps me calm down and release stress or anger. I love Bella’s Bedtime Blanket 2. It is my favorite because she time travels to go meet the Write brothers and I think that is SO COOL! Also, there are no adds which I absolutely LOVE ❤️! This app is for people between 2-98(all ages). This is why I love calm.,Love this app, but weird new glitch is occurring where even if I don’t have the app open, the intro rain noises will suddenly start playing out of no where. It’s happened a number of times now and I can’t get it to stop unless I open up the app and force close it. This has been happening for a week now and restarting my phone does not make a difference. Super frustrating!,Calm has changed my life every single day.  If I say it’s made the world better. . . that is not true. It’s made me better. I see more. I feel accepting of me and then I feel acceptance of all those around me. I am the recipient of wonder and peace. . . how can I not share with those I meet? With those I care about ?\\nWith those I love?,This is a decent sleep app. It has the sleep sounds and stories and everything. However, even though it’s designed to relive stress and anxiety, it has now become the source of my annoyance and disappointment. Whenever I get ready to go to sleep and click on some sleep music, I end up with Calm premium which is very stressful. I ended up downloading a different app with much lower prices and the same quality as this one. Please, for your claim to releasing stress, either take away premium altogether or lower the prices.,I hate spending so much time looking for a podcast that’s interesting but not so riveting that I’ll stay awake all night. This app is filled with gentle voices telling me stories I don’t care about, but soft and easy to listen to. The meditations are fine but the sleep stories are the real gems. Some of the music mixes are great too.,I want to express my reaction to news that your company is supporting tennis player Naomi Osaka. I was surprised and delighted. I was reminded that your app was a tool for healing. Ironically, I put it to little use during The Pandemic. I was actually too busy —- surviving. Now, I am resuming my practices. They are, I am reminded, part of my survival tool kit.\\n\\nD,I started using calm at the beginning of the pandemic and it really helped me to cope. Then I discovered the master classes and the spark and the breathing exercises and it helped me to thrive. I recommend it to anyone many people whether to help them through difficulty or to support them as they evolve.,I love this app and it helped me get rid of a lot of my stress. But I could only use it for a couple of days because of the fact that so much of it u need to pay for. I would pay for it but I’m 11 and I don’t have that kind of money😅. So I think u should make a little more of this app free so people can partially use it with out paying.,I was fortunate to get a free year trial from my cardholder and have been enjoying the benefits. For some reason, the Calm app isn’t able to keep track of what time zone I’m in and I’ve noticed that despite meditating at night sometimes, the app will register this as the next day even though the Daily Calm for the that day hasn’t been released yet. Would like this to be fixed!,This app kept crashing and help directed me to uninstall and reinstall the app. It then worked fine for awhile until I accidentally deleted it. When I tried to reinstall it, I got a message that my device was not compatible!? That makes so sense since it was recently updated and working. I am not happy with this and will now consider uninstalling from other devices. I have not had these kinds of issues with other Apps.,My only problem is it costs too much, and can’t unlock certain things. Seeing how lost my job due to covid that doesn’t completely help, but love how I still have access to other programs for the free aspect of the app. Other than that, very soothing and very helpful!,What I love: I use this app almost every night for the sleep stories, which are excellent and highly effective. Thank you SO much for providing such high quality scripts and voice talent. I also appreciate the variety of topics - and diversity of voices.\\n\\nMy issue: Most of the stories are around 30 minutes, which is long enough to put me to sleep. But then I often awaken when they end and have to manually restart or start a different one, which means more interrupted sleep.\\n\\nMy request: Please please please add either a playlist option or continuous play feature and/or more anthologies. \\n\\nThank you 🙏💗,We need 2 additions!!\\n\\n1: Please add a gratitude window at the end of the meditations in the “check in with yourself” thank popup\\n\\n2: A smile notification option to be able to remind you to smile more throughout the day\\n\\nThere is so many great features in this app and I love all the reminders to smile during meditation.\\n\\nI love this app especially that it doesn’t ask how did that make you feel at the end of each meditation like a lot of other apps. we seem to have an inherent way of subconsciously feeling self judgment when question like that are asked. You guys even talked about that very topic right there on the app, too!,I love the app before on my other phone before it broke. On that phone I had time in and many of my options were unlocked. But now that I logged in on my new phone everything is locked. 😟The app helped me go to sleep EVERY night. Now I have to calm down other ways.,I love your app but please stop moving the music categories around.  If your using this as a test trials on us, please say so.  It’s so annoying to have to guess where to find the music I want. Of course, unless you provide a search function.   Either way, please help me find my music that is not yet in my favorites or off-line folders.,Totally worth it ! Just buy lifetime and use it everyday. \\n\\nDevelopers please fix the bug that the sound such as ocean or waves etc.  will often start playing in the background and continue forever until I close app.  Despite clicking stop.  It’ll turn back on.,Ever since I began using this app, daily meditation has drastically improved my mood and functionality, almost completely ridding me of my anxiety and frequent panic attacks. I would recommend this to absolutely everyone, even those who are already sound of mind.,I have been using this app for two or three years now but this year during the pandemic it has been exceptionally helpful. I would highly rated the music and daily meditations. I keep wanting to hear a bedtime story but never made the time but I’m sure that’s awesome too. Mark Agnello,I work in healthcare. The stress of the day sometimes carries into  my sleep time and I find it impossible to relax. This app has made such a difference. Had no faith that it would help but figured I’d try it. I can’t believe how quickly it helped me find calmness. It’s truly magical. So glad I gave it a try.,When you lock your phone, the audio stops.  Really?  I’m trying to get some darn sleep and I have to leave the screen on?  I guess I’ll just flip my phone on it’s face to eliminate the light.  Oh wait, even though the app is open and running, it doesn’t prevent my phone from automatically shutting the screen off and locking after 30 seconds.  But I’m SURE that feature is unlocked with the paid version.  Why even have a free version?  If this is your idea of advertising scheme, I’m not biting.,Calm is the best. I start each day with it and often end my days with it. I enjoy the meditation classes and the Daily Calm. I highly recommend it for anyone who desires peace, joy and calm in their lives. It\\'s for everyone especially a bustling, hectic world. It has inspired me to pursue a Certification in meditation so I can teach it in my work.,I find myself reaching for this instead of my usual vices most times when I am not sure what to do. There is something for most everything you are feeling and I always feel better after each session. The sleep meditations are wonderful as well.,I have had calm for quite awhile now. I had no idea that there were so many options you can choose from on this app. It is a mini self help for us to use at anytime any day that is convenient to me. That is priceless for me. The range of things you can use is the best.,I am enjoying calm a lot. It it has sleep stories (even for kids). I has breathing and music. Everything is good except the breathing because they are too long. For our family sleep stories are just like sleeping related stories which we can watch at any time.,I only rated this app 4 stars because of Tamara Levitt’s voice. I’m really not trying to be mean, but her voice is maddening and distracting to me, and she is the only choice on so many of the guided meditations. My feelings on her voice obviously have zero to do with her person or being. I’m sure she’s a lovely human being, I just don’t want her voice guiding my meditations.,I only currently use calm for ambient noises to sleep. Specifically the soundscapes are excellent. Huge fan of “Jasper Lake” and “City Rain”. I hope one day I’ll take advantage of more that calm has to offer. Despite my narrow uses I still thoroughly enjoy the product and the app. Highly recommend for ambient sleep noises.,I start a sleep story and two minutes in it stalls. Not every time but enough to be an anonymous.  The night does not change to the following day without clicking completely out of the app. All in all I am glad I have this resource.,I found this app when my anxiety and depression was so out of control I almost could not function. The emergency clam helped so much. It helped me enough to seek a mental health professional. Now I have an excellent therapist and meds that help regulate my brain chemistry. The sleep stories are my favorite.,Part mental gymnasium, part classroom, part podcast, part bubbling brook & chirping swallow soundtrack, Calm is a well-blended mix of content designed to challenge, teach, and inspire us in the pursuit of balance. I wish the masterclass roster would expand a bit, that’s the only place I currently see lacking (and it’s not enough to subtract a star).,I like this app because it helps me with my “anger issues” and it’s very relaxing. I try to follow along but my mind always wanders! I listen to Calm Kids (11-13) and I think that the narrators voice is perfect for the whole meditating mood. 😂 At least it’s better than my scratchy voice lol. But yeah I recommend.,I am enjoying this app so much! My stress level has reduced dramatically after only one day/ imagine what a year could do! I only wish that I could afford that right now but I can\\'t. As soon as I can though, I will happily pay $69! Thank for a taste of what I truly want in my life!\\n                          Jade Beetle,I work a lot and even when I lie down for bed my mind still seems to be going. Calm relaxes my mind and thus relaxes my body. Now I can’t make it through a calm series completely because I’m sleep within the first few minutes. For me it’s a mental investment that’s so worth it.,Loves the app initially. The sleep meditations are excellent. Those are why the app was recommended to me and why I recommended it to others. But unfortunately, the same sleep meditations are not as effective after listening to them over and over. Calm seems to have moved their focus elsewhere - lots of new other shiny toys, but just the same sleep meditations. Hoping they add new ones.,I’m not one to write reviews for apps, but Calm presents me daily with the opportunity to hone my focus, control my thoughts, and evolve into deeper ways of experiencing the present moment and world around me. \\n\\nI’ve used the other apps, however, the variety and value contained in Calm is much greater for me. \\n\\nWhen I started out two months ago, I had a wild monkey mind. I still do on occasion and my practice isn’t always perfect. But with Calm’s guidance, I’m now sitting in 45-60 minute meditations with no problems.\\n\\nI feel balanced, my extraneous thoughts are silenced, and I’m living a much more aware existence. I’m very grateful.,I loved Calm. There was enough there that was free to keep me engaged with the app. Lately everything seems to be behind a paywall. I can change my scenes and hear different sounds but how long before those get put behind a paywall? It seems the only thing I can do now is the daily meditation. I understand that you all need to make money but come on! I would deal with listening to ads if it would open up more content. Perhaps you should consider that as an option.,I’m one of those people who gets anxious at bedtime. No matter how sleepy I am, my mind wanders and I end up tossing and turning for hours. White noise is no help for that, but the wonderful stories with soothing voices have worked like a charm...they work so well I have yet to hear the ending or one!,i love this app it helps me focus on big days like before school or before a test or before I go to sleep it helps me in the best and worst of times. I wish I could unlock premium but it’s a little two expensive for me but there are still some awesome free sounds story’s and encouraging speeches.,This app has changed my life in a positive way.  I also use it at night for my child because of its amazing selection of kids stories. So grateful for this app I am writing a review so that it can continue on the market and be a positive source of inspiration to others.,I am paying for a subscription right now and I enjoy the app. My number one biggest problem is that Tamara Levitt narrates what feels like the majority of it and I feel bad saying this but I find her voice to be very irritating. So basically I avoid anything with her and she does *most* of the series :/ \\n\\nI hate myself for being this judgmental. Feels very unmindful but I just can’t help it.,I’ve never been a sound sleeper, but using this app really does make falling asleep much easier! I would LOVE if they could create a “play next” feature so if I’m not totally out by the time my story ends I don’t need to get up to select a new one or soundscape. Other than that I would suggest it to everyone wanting a little relaxation!,I started experiencing more anxiety from the stress of my job but then decided to start listening to this app every morning as I was starting my day and it helped me take away the worry & the negative thoughts, and just started to calm me each morning. Now this is part of my morning routine! Love this app!,I have really bad sleep problems. My mind does not stop thinking. Even though my body is exhausted. I was a sceptic about this app at first but I’m glad I gave it a chance. I fall asleep within minutes. Give it a try. You can always cancel if it’s not for you.,The app looks nice, but I wouldn’t know if I actually want to use it/sign up for a free trial if I can’t hear or see what’s on it. Absolutely everything in the app requires premium, you can sign up for a trial but it’s complicated and I want to see if it’s worth it to go through that trouble of signing up for a trial. Don’t get if you won’t subscribe for premium,I have been a restless sleeper for a long time.  Never really gave it any thought until I got older and started to do research on sleep.  I tried Calm and it works in putting me to sleep through out the night.  Love all the different sounds and I’m even learning how to meditate and focus.,I just got this app and I started on the 7 days of anxiety, it was only my first day but it really Helped put my mind at ease, thank you. Seriously. Thank you so much for making this app, it’s a literal life saver, I totally recommend this app to anyone that’s having anxiety or ADHD like myself, it really helps.,The app works well and has a lot of variety, probably more than I really need. Tamara’s voice, however, is grating and unpleasant, even for the 10 minute Daily Calm. I’m ASMR, and there is a limited selection (voices only, which is perfect for me) of ASMR in the Calm app, so I know that’s on the Calm developers’ radar screen.  Maybe Tamara loves the sound of  her own voice, but please try to offer us users more options.,I am not sure where any of the free things are in the app. Everything I pulled up said try it for free and then you subscribe. I understand things cannot all be free but I have found nothing that is. I was just looking to try to find some of the stuff to try before I bought anything but I cannot find anything except the water that turns on immediately upon opening the app. I’m sure it is nice but I don’t just pay for things like this without hearing things first.,I love the sound editing. As soon as I open the app, I begin to calm down or start getting drowsy. I just started using it and can’t wait to go to bed. I subscribed to help my sleep but have found many other options that I intend to utilize such as meditation and others.,I downloaded this app during the first few weeks of the COVID pandemic and I can honestly say that I’ve used it almost every day since then. If you’re looking for different ways to bring more peace into your life, I’d strongly recommend adding this to your daily routine.,One month into the COVID pandemic I was experiencing fast heart rate and highly negative thoughts. I downloaded the one year subscription and started a daily meditation practice. I started with 30 days learn to meditate and now listen to the Daily Calm — everyday fir a year.  This really helped me with serenity. Thank you!,I love the sleep stories and meditations, but I hate to say, Tamara Levits voice is not soothing or helpful when trying to sleep. Her voice is the female equivalent of Hannibal Lector. There are\\nOptions for some meditations to select a narrator and I think this should be an option across the board. For the price you pay, I think it’s a reasonable request.,My mom used to read this book to me many a night and each time she read it she would burst into tears. As a little boy I would always ask her what was wrong, the poignancy of the story going over my head.\\n\\nIt is a beautiful story but it is sad. Well, it is happy and sad.,I’ve been using this app for a few months and like it a lot. Went through the full “30 days” series and have been doing a Daily Calm or a Daily Trip almost every day. But what happened to the Daily Trips? They seem to be missing today, including those that I had marked as favorites. :(,I signed up for a trial, didn\\'t work. Forgot about it. A week later i get a notification i got charged 80 for access to premium (whatever that means) for a year. Why would anyone buy a yearly subscription after a free trial? They automatically set for a year even though a monthly subscription is available. My account is over drawn. *u*k this app i want my money back if you\\'re truly an insomniac it does not work and their automatic payment settings are predatory.,I got a 7day trial and then wouldn’t start unless I selected a subscription, then needs a subscription for most of content because it says it is free. However even if u get a year worth it is cents to a day. I can also tell it relaxes me because I listened to the sleep stories and slept for 12 hours every night.,This app has helped me calm down and realize amazing things. When you fill out the “How are you feeling”, it gives you audios and quotes to help you with a strong emotions if needed. I would recommend this app VERY MUCH!!! Oh and you can listen to nature like fire, rain, thunderstorms, white noise and more!,Not only do I use this in my house doe me and my kids, as a teacher, this runs in my classrooms and really accesses the kids, especially this year. Both my children and my students ask for it and are noticeably calmer minutes into the music or soundscape or story. Love this thing.,I downloaded the app because I was having trouble sleeping and after creating my account (which was quick and easy) I couldn’t find one song, nature soundscape, or anything for free! I understand they need to make money somehow but I would like to have some free options! However when you are on the app it plays some nature sounds which is quite pleasant you can also customize what nature sound you like.,It helps me sleep, it helps me calm down during travel, it has a variety of soundscapes. Some you may have never thought was an option and there\\'s also visuals that go with the sound as well. I want to invest in the lifetime option,I love Calm it gives me a reason to look forward to going to bed when my Mom tells me to. But one thing is I wish more meditation options if you don’t have the premium set. But other wise it’s amazing and I think you should get it to😁,At first this app seems to have a lot to offer; then you realize almost every meditation is guided by Tamara. That’d be great if I just loved Tamara, but I don’t. I liked a few at first, but I find myself so irritated that she is my only option that now I can’t enjoy anything she guides. I do love the soundscapes and nature melodies. Going to give it another week to see if I find anything that makes it worth keeping. But for now, I’m leaning towards canceling.,Thank you for the work you are doing! I look forward each day to a beautiful mediation, and my life ( and in turn the lives of others, I hope) are getting better. The sleep stories and other trainings are wonderful too. Thank you.,This app has been amazing to use, not only because of the stunning visuals but because it is super user friendly. It also has a variety of meditation exercises, music, courses and other activities to help you relax and improve your well-being.,I love this app and use it constantly- at work, to go to sleep, on my commute.  I really wish there was a simple button on the Home Screen to get me to a list of my favorites. It takes too long to find them, especially in the middle of the night.,Love this app! My only negative thing to say is I wish they offered more meditations that did not have Tamara as the voice. There’s just something about her voice that does not allow me to fully relax so it’s harder to find other people leading meditations. Other than that great app and has really helped my mental health!,Love this app so far! Wondering if there’s a way to set an automatic start timer for the sleep music. I have a specific need for this. I know you can set a timer to turn it off, so wondering if this feature can be added, or if there’s a workaround for the iPhone?,I love this app.  It’s easy to use and the variety is awesome.   I practice daily so the variety is refreshing.  It opens my mind to new and exciting avenues of mind calming.  The daily background music is life changing for me.  It settles my anxiety and blood pressure instantly.   Thank you Calm.  Keep up the good work ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars!,I can finally get a good night’s sleep now! Calm’s Sleep Stories work like magic (my favorite is A Rainy Day in Paris), and using that plus one of their meditations in the morning really helps me maintain a calm and productive state of mind. I don’t know what I would do without this app! Thank you Calm! :),The Calm app has the ability to be incredible but the app crashes daily, especially with anything selected involving sleep. The app will crash over and over again until you delete and reinstall. Then the following day it does the same thing. I strongly suggest you use another app until they fix their bugs. There is nothing calming by the frustration of trying to meditate or sleep.,I had the app on my phone for so long that I had a lot of different soundscapes from when they were free. Now that the app has updated I had to delete and reinstall because it kept crashing trying to start, and now all my favorite soundscapes are gone and there are only like three free ones for me to have on while I sleep. I would literally pay a one time fee if there did an app that was just background noise, I don’t need bedtime stories or meditation.,I was very iffy about trying this app. My therapist and psychiatrist recommended it. I have absolute no patience at times and it’s hard to bring my anger down. The breathing techniques and positive vibes it gives. It actually helps me calm down. It makes me happy. Give it a try! You won’t regret it. ❤️,I got the app because the month we have been selling your house has been super stressful and I wake up with my mind racing. I love love love the different options on this app to help get back to sleep. It helps having wireless earbuds.,I started using the Calm app almost a year ago. I was feeling very anxious & stressed because of the pandemic as well as dealing with a negative experience in my life. I am so grateful to have found this app. It has helped me through guided meditations to heal myself with loving kindness. I highly recommend this app.,I used to be an avid Calm app user a couple years ago and there was so much more free content and mediations compared to now. I came back to it to try and improve my sleep and was frustrated to find all my favorite meditations are no longer available unless I pay for a subscription. Very misleading advertisement I have been hearing go around too about downloading the free app. Yeah it’s free to download but that is about it.,I bought this cause I saw LeBron had a series, but was looking for mainstream meditation take up the bulk of what I listen to. I cannot stand the voice of the woman who does most of the meditation guidance however. I realize it’s highly subjective, but they should still have more variety. Headspace offers 2-3 different voices for popular lessons, and there’s enough vocal variety there to have plenty to choose from.,I’m not one for buying subscriptions but this app brings me peace. From the meditations to the sleep stories. However I find myself listening to the music more than anything. Several gems are in this app including string version of Exhale by Sabrina Carpenter, Lo-Fi beats, and the most awesome Dreams playlist by Priscilla Ahn.,I had only wanted to do the 7 day free trial and I get a $76 charge from my bank account today. I canceled the unwanted subscription, but I will still be able to access the app for an entire year. I’d much rather have my money back. Please and Thank You. The app is great but I am in no shape to have $76 taken out of my account right now. Especially if I am not using the app everyday. If I could please have my money back. Thanks.,I hope they keep expanding on the content. I have really, really bad sleep anxiety, paralysis and deal with psychosis when stressed or depressed. It’s been helpful to use Calm daily and it’s helped a good chunk of my symptoms. It’s a big deal. I was sleeping only 1-3hrs a night. I’m up to 5-6 which was great for me.,This is a great app and is definitely worth the money. It has so many great sleep stories and daily check ins too! I have this app since it ever came out and I can tell you that it only gets better! You have to get this and you should believe me!💙,I only use this app for sleep stories so I can’t comment on any other content. But what’s not to love about falling asleep to the sound of Bob Ross, Scottie Pippen, John McEnroe, Matthew McConaughey and many more? I use it every night and I am very happy I was able to purchase a lifetime membership on sale.,Calm app 10 minutes meditation every day morning something new learning, this will help everyone being mindful during the day and automatically build the skill to become stronger, stress free, not being emotional and many more benefits!,here’s my opinion:\\nwhen i saw the ad for this app and sounded like it was legit so i downloaded to try it out. But to my surprise  literally everything costs money and it’s SEVENTY DOLLARS for one year which i think is a little insane but i just wanted to y’all that this app is not really that worth it just saying (disclaimer: i think there’s like 4 things that are free but only 4 and everything else just costs money which i think is a rip off),I noticed this awhile ago, but I miss setting the breathing exercises that you want to do, not only the ones they have programmed. I also noticed that they did away with the weekly goals which is a bummer because it gave me accountability. Still a good app to use, but if they\\'re not broken, why fix some of the positive features?,This app paid for itself in the sleep stories that help calm my kids before bed. We also read to the kids but to help them sleep they have loved the sleep stories. When someone is upset before bed this is our go to!!!!!,Really helps guys. I thought I was going to have to go to the doctor. My first day started on Sunday and I was the most productive I ever was at work today. I’m from the Houston Tx area. I promise it’s worth the meditations. Do your mood check ins and compare!! I will be using as often as possible.,The voices/narrators used are not soothing at all. That was a surprise given the seemingly high production quality. It does not feel chill, for lack of a better term; rather, it feels like you\\'re in a university lecture. Not good. \\n\\nAdditionally, I simply don\\'t find the content helpful. There are free resources that helped me better. \\n\\nI\\'m a healthcare worker who downloaded this to help w acute stress. I can\\'t recommend this at all to anyone going through any kind of real stress. It\\'s just weak tea that doesn\\'t even sound good.,The app has helped not only my but my kids during this difficult times. When we all went on quarantine the anxiety level was through the roof in my house. And between the meditations, story night and evening wine downs, we learn to calm ourselves down,It actually works . I love this so much. It seems expensive. But if you have insomnia like me ....it beats taking sleeping aids that make you feel like crap each day. I was enjoying the stories like my mind is clear and picturing what they say . Al I remember was the beginning like wow I love this story then I fell asleep.,I got the annual subscription and regretted it the first months. Over 70% of the content is by Tamara Levitt, so if you do not like her style of meditation then you are out of luck. It is essentially the Tamara Levitt meditation app. With a handful of guest stars. I would look elsewhere. Waste of money.,I was pretty disappointed by the limited somatic practices and rather narrow and repetitive daily prompts. I feel like this app tries to provide too many services and stretches itself thin, which compromises the quality that can be achieved. There are some really nice functions in this, but overall I feel I only am interested in 30% of what the app offers and the quality of that 30% isn’t worth the cost,The Calm App has transformed myself and my world. The wide array of mediations and sound scapes allows me to stick with doing the mediation and being able to truly relax and feel\\ngrounded. I can say now after a year plus of being on the Calm App, I have more peace and harmony than ever.,Hello, I don’t believe mental health should have to cost money to get. I want to calm down about money, not spend money doing so. I hope this helps you change your app a bit Calm! I gave it four stars because I like the Feeling part and I don’t want to be mean.,The sleep stories are great. One minute I can’t sleep, the next minute I’m awake the next morning, well rested. I think the key is that you fall asleep while listening to the story. That’s what’s on your mind, not problems or schedules or to-do lists or stress. Try it, well worth the $$$$!,I’ve been using Calm for a year now. It has helped me cope with so much. I like how it has meditation but also music and inspirational talks. I became a lifetime subscriber just recently. Highly recommend. We all need calm in this very tumultuous world we’re living in right now.,After reading what you guys are doing for athletes like Naomi Osaka, I re-downloaded your app and gave it a real shot. I was down and not having a good start to my day and remembered this app. It changed my entire day...and I have become a Calm believer! Peace of Mind, in an app!,Yes, Thanks!\\nFor the failure I remark about, isn’t \\nJust me, the way I feel failure is that I wish I could’ve helped more people.\\nThe Abortion Clinics, the kids, the lives of the \\nNeedy that I’ve been donating to for so long ,\\nHas slowed down, as the times have found fate.\\nBut now, I feel that I will be able to full-fill my\\nJourney to care and to help those, less fortunate \\nThan I. \\nThat’s what my friends are teaching me now &\\nI feel refreshed inside, as though we still have a\\nLong way to go!\\nI’ve made some changes in my life, caring changes, that have brought me peace in the way\\nThat it was meant to be…\\nThank You!,Thankful for our God who has guided me through 64 years on the beautiful ever changing and exciting world that he made for his children to enjoy til his son returns to take us home to be with him,I love this app but do not find Tamara Levitt’s voice to be calming at all. I feel like her narrating voice is forced and even has a tone reminiscent of being condescending. Don’t get me started on the vocal fry. Since most meditations are narrated by her, especially the daily calms, this makes a lot of content that irritates more than relaxes me. There needs to be more variety in the meditation narration.,this app has helped me fall asleep every night for the last year! it has been very helpful, but i would like to point out that there is not a way to make a playlist/line up of sleep stories, and i have to go back through the process of waking up/falling back asleep after putting on a new story.\\n\\notherwise, there are a huge number of sleep stories, and the readers are very diverse. the price seems very expensive, but i have definitely used it to it’s fullest potential, and it’s worth the cost.,I downloaded Calm to start the new year, and am enjoying the Daily Calm, Masterclasses, and music features of the app. Thanks to Jeff and Tamara for their 10 minute guided meditations every day, your effort and insights are appreciated. Overall, the app is easy to use and a nice resource to practice mindfulness.,Calm makes me so relaxed all the time. When ever I am down or something is wrong I can always occupy myself or make myself feel better using calm. Also, sometimes when I am just bored calm is a good way to meditate, relax, or even try to sleep. It is awesome!,Like I said in the title ⬆️ \\nBut this app is amazing. I use the lullabies to put my baby to sleep. I use the anxiety ones when I’m overwhelmed. I have found this to be one of the best I’ve gotten to use! Definitely worth paying monthly for!!,This app has been popping up constantly on ads, so ofc i had to get it. I thought it would be amazing i actually only thought it was nature sounds at first until i downloaded the app. I was super excited to try it because their were so many things to choose from like music, anxiety, sleeping, ext. But ofc i can’t even listen to anything but cricket noises since you have to buy premium just to listen to a bedtime story! i would give this 0 stars if i could.,I enjoy this app and most of its features. However, I feel like I’m not getting the full experience or my money’s worth because I can’t use any of the meditations. They work properly, but the sound of Tamara Levitt is not relaxing. The tone is not a soft, calming tone and it actually makes me more irritated. It would be nice to have diversity in the vocal narration of the meditations that could be more soothing to people.,Sorry, I can’t have any part of that race-baiting , riot-enticing lebron. Saw that commercial and instantly got rid of this app… too bad. Maybe start picking neutral people for your commercials. Totally sick of companies supporting left/right sides. Your not in politics, keep your personal opinions out of your company’s visions. I only support companies who do not put their political bias out there. I don’t care what side it’s on. I don’t hate people and I won’t support companies who support hate.,Like many as we slowly progress through this pandemic my anxieties were compounding daily. Calm has helped turn my phone into less of a messenger of bad news and more a place where I can relax. Delete social media and download calm.,I’ve used and subscribed to Calm for about 6 years and have used it to help with my anxiety and as a part of my daily sleep routine. Since the newest update I have been stuck on the take a deep breath page and am unable to get onto the app (over 2 weeks and counting). I would love to revise my review because I love this app more than anything but it is frustrating paying for an app you use everyday but can’t even get into.,So i love this app too fall asleep and meditate dont get  me wrong! \\nbut i also dont like how there is like 2 things u can get without premium...i mean some people dont have money to get all this,....and i mean..i woukd love this app even more if i coukd ACTUALLY have SOME things for free...i get u guys need money or whatever but some people dont have that! so think about that,I’ve been a meditation practitioner for a number of years and I have tried many different resources to aid my practice.  None have come close to Calm.  It has such a wide array of tools and is so helpful.  Hands down the best.  10/10.,This seems like an app that I would love.\\nHowever, I feel that you should at least give access to some of the meditations for free so ppl know if they like it or not enough to purchase this.\\nThe idea that ppl will cancel after 7 days is almost a given that they will forget or it will be a hassle to even try.\\nFor that reason I won’t be purchasing what seems to be an amazing app that has a lot to offer.\\nPls reconsider and have some things unlocked so we can listen before we sign up.\\nTysvm.,I like the app a lot but I wish there were more voices to choose from. I also wish some of the nature sounds were better for sleep / didn’t have so much birds chirping. Lastly, it seems like the visual representation and usability of the data from the check ins could be more robust as well 🤔,I’m so grateful to have found this app! It has changed my ability to find peace in the day whether it’s a morning meditation, the daily calm, or a sleep story! This is totally worth it for the person looking to commit to a consistent meditation practice and more peaceful mindset!,I’ve been using this app for almost a year now. Ramon (Rainy Day in Paris) and Eva (Nightfall) are the only reasons I fall asleep and can go back to sleep when I get wake in the middle of the night. This app really helps me manage anxiety without prescriptions. I will definitely be renewing.,Listen it works well, it helps me sleep. But I had no idea they were gonna charge me what they did. And when I went to see my subscription plan, I noticed that they had chosen the $70 one for me when there’s one for like $40 that is the exact same. So kinda feel like I got scammed out of $30. So be careful, make sure you check your plan before your free week is up.,I loved the calm app and very upset that I had to cancel my subscription apple was charging twice a month and to this very moment they have yet to contact me and make this right \\nVery upset by this and I truly miss listening to my meditation series at night \\n😞😞😞,Twice now, money has been taken from my account with no notice & with having turned off the auto subscribe feature. When I first started using Calm, I really enjoyed the app, not a fan now. Not at all interested in any of their meditations. I still use the same ones I’ve always used, before I paid!,I wrote a review a couple weeks or so ago. Reported major bugs and then being BLOCKED from using most of it even though I’d paid for it. (My credit card has proof). Gave it 2⭐️ trusting they would respond to my other messages after seeing my review. Nope! Fortunately my credit card company issued me a full refund. At this point, if I could give it 0⭐️ I would. Horrible customer service (non existent). This app will leave you MORE stressed than before you got it.,It was one of those thins where I was going to cancel before my free 7 day trial expired. Well I forgot to do that and that’s perfectly fine. I’ve used it every night for the past week and have fallen asleep easier than I can ever remember,I have been feeling I anxious especially through the pandemic it has gotten ours… I tried to trial this week and I am so pleased I am going to continue with this app… It really helps thank you very much… Maybe if you can add more  yoga classes that would be great,This app is used by our entire family. From playing lullabies & sleep stories to the grandkids when they sleep over to playing selections for ourselves for motivation, relaxation, or any number of things, the Calm app has it all!,I’m stressing over a class I have to take to keep my job. It’s maddening. And then, I met Calm. I look forward to the night because Calm is the substitute for my $500 down comforter I can’t afford that I wrap myself in now. This app will forever be a part of my routine.,I sometimes fall asleep on the couch while watching TV and then struggle when I move to bed.  I would then wake up an hour after falling asleep, get up and eat and toss and turn all night.\\n\\nWith Calm I listen to a story and try to stay awake until the end but I fall asleep around ten minutes into the story. I stay asleep all night and for the past 7 days I am feeling outstanding! I have lost weight and enjoy my job. \\n\\nI have been wanting to get to bed around 9:30 and waking up before the alarm at 6:00am. \\n\\nGreat job!,I love this but I also hate it. This app makes me calm and happy but it also makes me mad because I wanted to listen to some songs but I have to pay and what if I don’t want to pay? Do I just not be calm?\\nI just wish it would not be so much money to try to be happy. This app is trying to help you and me but it can’t if I don’t want to wait my money.\\nI will be finding a new app to try to make me happy and calm.,Please add more free songs, it makes me feel like I should just go find a new app but I know you need money so ya. Helpful tips - you should get more feelings for the mood check in.  Like (lost) ( sick) ( in love)  thank you for helping me get through the hellish days and nights I have.,This actually seems like a good app but why does it have to cost. People need that calming moment where everything is still, not too loud, but not too quiet.  Just a moment to really unwind and not have to worry about paying for something just to further their mental health.,The content is really great, but it keeps crashing and takes forever for to actually boot up. \\n\\nHow about instead of constantly tacking on new stuff, you try simplifying it so that the performance isn’t garbage?,I know I should have expected to be forced to pay money to use this app but I would have never guessed I would have to pay 70 bucks a year. I bet you can always find everything on this app that’s as good or better online for free. I had this app on my phone for many months now and I don’t know why since you can’t use anything without paying so much money.,I wanted to like this app, and the first meditation I did was fine. And there was potential. However the second meditation I did was on international women’s day and more than half of the daily meditation was taken up with talking about how we need to create a more just society. Which is fine and true, but it’s not appropriate or helpful to put it in the middle of a daily meditation. I thought at that point no thanks.,So, I’m 11 years old and having trouble sleeping so I downloaded this app and I liked it at first, but unless you pay a fee per year it only gives you one noise and the entire other app is unavailable. If the developers are reading this, capsule you consider adding more stuff to listen to?,Pleeeeease offer all or, at least, more of your guided meditations with John’s voice as narrator. I love the app *but* most are narrated by Tamara🙁. While I’m grateful that she’s the Head of Mindfulness, her voice just does NOT do it for me. John’s voice is extremely soothing and I won’t always do certain meditations if he isn’t an option for narration. \\n\\nPLEASE HAVE JOHN ARMSTRONG AS NARRATOR ON AS MANY GUIDED MEDITATIONS POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!,I was hoping for some calming noises like rain.. Instead the only free content you get is a bunch of people talking the entire time. Trash, 0/10, there\\'s no free content that\\'s ACTUALLY calming. I\\'m trying to sleep, and the video I was watching for it was a woman talking about stress and anxiety, which doesn\\'t help at all. You should find a better app, this one doesn\\'t deserve any kind of credit because it\\'s just money hungry.,This is the most calming game I ever played and I’m righting this at night and I’m relly tied so this house has spiders and believe me you do not want to sleep in the family room so yeah also my moms room and my dads room my great parents room and I have a phobia of spider and open ocean sooo please don’t bully me\\n\\n-winter,Calm always makes me feel better.\\nI feel connected to someone, something from the gentle sense of peace it gives.\\nGreat job in creating this connection.  I didn’t even want to refer to Calm as an app.\\nThank you for caring for others with Calm.,Seriously this app may seem cliche but it’s far from it, if you even at the slightest are interested in this app this is your sign to DOWNLOAD IT!!! If you’re even on the app page reading this review. Go back and hit subscribe!!!,I have never payed for this app and my favorite song used to be free sobre la oratoria but I recently got a new phone and forgot about the app for a while and was in the mood to hear it I can’t listen to it anymore that’s unfair and don’t tell me you had to get paid because it was free before and they could’ve made other songs the ones you have to pay for I really liked that song and am very disappointed,This app is the best!! I have unbelievable trouble sleeping but I’ve only made it through a few of these stories. AND I’VE LISTENED TO A LOT. If you need help sleeping, download this app. This app is also great for calming stress and anxiety and things like that. It helped me through the Pandemic and other... things. DOWNLOAD THIS APP,Personally, I don’t find Tamara Levitt to be the most calming guide. I wish there was more variety in the people who lead the daily calm and the other meditations throughout the app. I end up listening to the same few meditations because of this.,When I first got this app, I thought it would help me release stress and get some sleep.\\n\\nWhat I didn’t know, however, was that to actually achieve any of these goals I need to pay $70 a year just to take an anxiety lesson.\\n\\nInstead of actually helping people who have have trouble relaxing, they add on to that stress by requiring a fee ton their so called “free” app.,Live the how to meditate series - I’ve known for years meditation would help me but never could figure out how to start. This is doing it for me!\\n\\nMy mood after this mornings lesson (#6) is “Inspired” but there’s is not choice for that. Would live to see it!!!\\n\\nLove the rain background. Is there a way to play it outside the app, let’s say while I check mail it do something in another app? \\n\\nThank you thank you thank you for all I have discovered in the app so far. Totally worth the premium!!,It costed quite a bit of money to get it but it was very worth it. It’s such a high quality app. It’s simply just relaxing to scroll through all the stories.  I’ve gotten of my point, it’s a great app and I would recommend buying it.,The best thing I’ve added to my bedtime routine!  The stories, the music, and the sleep sounds are all amazing!  I use it EVERY night!  You think you’ll be distracted by staying awake to listen but it lulls you to sleep so nicely.  Must have!  Download it now!,Clam is amazing it have amazing people trying to help struggling people like me in a way the will calm you and I don’t know if it is just me but I have become more motivated and ready for life than ever! You need to download it right away because this is amazing!,Come on guys I understand you have to pay for the app and the rights to the music and stuff like that. but not everyone can afford that price tag. Now I’m sure it’s great once you spend the 70 dollars but if it’s late and your just trying to get some rest it’s not gonna help you when you download the app and it asks you to spend 70 dollars. I just think with how big the app is I think you guys can do better and bring the price down.,I used this several times a week until they added background music to the stories. I find it distracting and instead of one thing lulling me to sleep, that one thing is now interrupted by the music, keeping me awake.,Was told to try Calm for my stress and anxiety. Thought I was doing a trail periods d bam, charged $70 before I even knew.  Thanks Calm, added more stress and anxiety to my life.    Was enjoying the app, but now very turned off by it!  Can’t manage to delete or unsubscribe, either.  Great another $70 I’m not needing drained out of my account.   😬,Calm has helped remind me of all the things that have negative impacts on me and how to release them.  It also reminds me of all I am grateful for.  Both of which are easy to take for granted without reminder and self reflection.,I have used Calm for a couple of years and love it but the new update makes it so that it doesn’t even load on my phone anymore. It just says “take a deep breath” and never opens. I tried restarting my phone but I don’t think the problem is on my end. Please fix!!!!,Calm has truly taught me so much, from the daily meditations, mantras, classes and yoga. It’s my go to while at work for the music love love Kygo! Need more Kygo.. also Keith Urban was an amazing new addition. Please please allow for Alexa communication/connectivity. That would make this a 10star app,I love starting my day with music from the calm app. It’s especially useful in helping me get focused for the workday. I also enjoy the short 10-15 min guided meditations, especially in the middle of a busy day.\\n\\nFantastic content for anyone seeking a calm and quiet mind!,Developers please read!! Overall i think this is a fantastic app however I don’t like how you have to pay for all the good stuff. If you could at least put some stop free other then a little that you already it would be fantastic.,Beautiful app. Unfortunately, there is not a single thing available without the premium pay-in option. At least simple habit has free content. This has nothing. I’ve heard good things so may try out the 7 day trial but this kind of business model which forces one to subscribe and then hope people forget to cancel is terrible and makes me not want to use it at all.,I love the app and it has been extremely helpful to manage my anxiety and stress during the pandemic. However, I installed last week’s update and now the app opens, says “take a deep breath” and crashes. Please fix!! Thanks!,I used this app a few months ago maybe even a year ago and a lot of things was free but now when I downloaded it again the things I used that were free are now locked and I need to Pat to use them and everything I see either in the for you or sleep they all have locks on them. Worthless,I\\'ve been using this app daily and have shared it with so many\\nPeople who all\\nAgree that it\\'s a much needed service to help keep a healthy mind and spirit .,I had a free trial and without previous notice or email receipt this app auto renewed itself. I found out trough my credit card billing and when trying to cancel and ask for refund they send you to Apple Customer Service which sent me back to the Calm Customer Support and so on…back and forth and no one being able to answer. \\nPoor customer service and no response what so ever from Calm just yet.,This app. Calm is the BEST I have ever place on my iPhone.  Two thumbs up 👍🏼👍🏼!!!  It helps me go to sleep knowing I have to wake up early for work, I love 💕 this app.!!!  I truly think all who reads this and like to be calm should truly get this app. Calm!😊,I really want to like this app. I would get so much more out of it if I could stand to listen to most of the available meditations. It would be 5 stars if you could select the voice you wanted to hear, but as that’s not an option I’m limited to soundscapes, some sleep stories and a small number of other offerings. Too bad.,I honestly believe more people would enjoy mediating if they used this app. It helps me at work, at home and in general be a better human. Can’t say enough things! Thank you calm and Tamara and everyone, really enjoy this app!,I’ve been a calm user for about two years. I absolutely rely on the sleep stories to calm my restless mind at night. This year, I paid to unlock content forever, which was most I’ve ever spent on an app, but it is well worth it.,I have found the Calm app clean, simple, and well done.  It is like having a meditation guru and many other gurus available at the tap on your phone.  I have been using now for 3-days and can tell the difference in my Calm ... mind, body, and soul.  So BREATHE ..... and try Calm.,I’ve had this app for 4 years and have loved it. For the past year, I noticed that it was slowing down and took quite a while to load content. Then tonight, it won’t load at all. Just stays on a purple screen that says take a deep breath. I seem to be the only ibe with the problem since I haven’t seen anyone else mention it. I tried deleting the app and reloading t. Didn’t work. So sad.,This app is very useful because it has a wide variety of options available to help you sleep or just sounds that just calm you down I don’t know what I would do if I did not have calm,I’m not going to complain about the lack of free content as I only tried the 7 day free trial, but the thing is I think I sampled every option on this app and not a single one made me calm. The meditation expert Tamara has an extremely annoying voice. Jeff Warren (?) so whiny and white. The stories aren’t relaxing or even interesting. I truly can’t figure out why this is so popular and I feel like this is something mostly bougie white women pretend to love to impress other bougie white women.,So I absolutely love this app the paying doesn’t really matter to me you get better things with that\\n\\nMy Favorite sleep story is Bella’s bedtime blanket ( I love both of them) could you maybe make a couple or more of the Bellas bedtime blanket \\n\\nMy favorite sleep song is Majestic Valley,Calm has such a variety of calming and soothing things from music, meditations, sleep stories and so many more!!! I love their app it has helped me grow as a person and change the way I look at different aspects of my life.,I hate this it takes like 5 minutes to set up plan but once it’s done you have to pay for it I feel like that’s retarded trying to find something that helps you that you have to pay for it because you probably can’t afford something else is really retarded I feel like this app should’ve been for people that don’t want to tell their parents about it or don’t want counseling but still need help you know,When I realized how much of my data they are selling I tried to unsubscribe, but they direct you to a link that does nothing OR is WRONG. \\n\\nIt is too difficult to access your account information within the application; it feels like it is designed to make it difficult or impossible to know how much you are paying, let alone unsubscribe, within the app.  \\n\\nThey tell you how to unsubscribe through Apple iTunes but the instructions are WRONG.  I STILL AM PAYING FOR AN APP I DO NOT WANT.  \\n\\nAlso, I think the content is not calming at all. The only thing I listen to is the sound of rain. Some of the voices are annoying, actually. There are more effective apps out there,I love most of the content Calm has put together for their app. Their sleepscapes and sleep stories are amazing! But, I wish the app was more customizable overall. I would like to be able to start my night off with a sleep story, and then have it automatically go into a sleepscape for the rest of the night.,I have been making use of the Calm app during most of the pandemic crisis— it has become a very good and healthy habit. During most of my life I have been a shallow breather. Now I have learned how to use my breath as a tool for my emotional health.,Pretty much 99% of the app is behind an expensive paywall, there used to at least be a decent rotating amount of free content to try but that was phased out immediately after they started making enough money. There still isn’t even a way to just pay for one section of the app, I’d consider a discounted subscription for the sleep stories instead of the all-or-nothing option they have now.,This app was in the App Store and it was free. So I got it but it’s truly disappointing how you have to pay. And it’s a huge price!!!!!!!! If your going to charge then can you at least do it in the App Store before someone downloads it and ends up disappointed? I just wish this was free and accessible to people with paying because it seems like an amazing app. It would be great if you could possibly do something about that thanks and sorry.,As a new massage therapist, I was in search of calming music and variety. This app has by far exceeded my expectations and has made it so much easier to run my business. It definitely helps me wind down and attend to my own self-care needs,Breathe is a better app. The stories in Calm oftentimes lack background music. It seems like Calm tries to employ celebrities to gain users when it should really just focus on delivering good content. I find the Calm app inferior to others.,after months of using the app I can honestly say I always find a way to come back to the app and find a great music piece or a guided meditation to put me at ease. Whether I use it very little or at times daily the Lifetime price is well worth it. IMO,I’ve tried meditation on and off over the years, but the Calm app has proven to be the one that really helps me make it a practice. It also goes beyond meditation to calming sleep stories and music I can use for working (calming but not distracting).,Hearing lebrons acvv CB pint of having to find balance in his physical as well as mental touches me and truly makes you understand now matter how smart you are no matter how physically capable you are . Unless you balance your mental awareness with your talents you will always fail,I got this app because I wanted to have access to the sleep stories, because I have a hard time sleeping. I open up the app and there is NOTHING for free. Everything needs a premium subscription. The only reason I didn’t rate this app one star is because you still have all of the sounds but other than that it’s pretty useless. So disappointed😡,Back when I used it a few years ago I couldn’t ever get off of the app I loved it. Now I can’t even log in to one of my old accounts. I made a new account last year but now whenever I try to use it all my history and things I downloaded are completely wiped. I miss the way it used to be. You could use practically everything now you can’t even download a single story. Piece of crap. Don’t recommend.,I was using this every night to sleep, but since the last update it won’t open, and crashes. Please fix this bug so I can listen to calming waters with birds singing, instead of the sonic stereo snoring of my husband and bull dog!,IF you are experiencing anxiety like I am I’m pleading with you to give CALM a try. It will change your world. It will give you the tools in a calm sensitive instructional way to deal with your own issues and make you feel more in charge of your true emotions. It’s a gift to yourself you won’t regret.,I have been using the breathing exercise for a while. I LOVED the calming purple background. Now you have made the box breathing (focus) option dayglo green. It is unbearable. I can no longer use this feature. I am a paid subscriber - if u want people like me to renew, please make the color configurable.,This app looks amazing and totally looks like it could help me mentally with all my struggles, but really 70 dollars a month so I can have mental sanity. I shouldn’t have to pay for a healthy mind and really wish that this app had a little more leniency when it came to the regular version, went into calm with high hopes and left dissatisfied.,The Calm app has it’s place for me.  With a wide variety of mood enhancing sounds I’ve been able to ID those that work best for me, whether I want motivation, relaxation or sleep I have found the sound to create a favorable ambiance...,I hate how this is marketed as a “free app”, but you have to pay $60 a year to do anything. I hate that I cannot really test anything out and see whether I like the app without paying the fee. Yeah, there is the “free trial”, but it you don’t cancel it on accident, you are out $60. Most people do not have that kind of money to spend yearly on an app. It’s clear they lost sight of actually helping people, and they just want to make a big buck off of struggling people.,For some reason, being pregnant makes women act a little up amd down... weird I know ! Anyway, I HAVE to remember that health is mind, body, and spirit ... I forgot about the mind and spirit for awhile and this helps me care for those daily.,I wish there was some option or library to see all narrators and select which you like to listen to. It’s annoying having to find ones without certain narrators voices. I must admit after using for about a year I no longer can stand the sound of certain narrators voices which led me to unsubscribe.,This app is amazing. I have been using it to sleep and meditate for 2 years. They have many celebrities reading sleep stories, and leading meditations. One on them is Lebron James. After his recent behavior I think they should take him off the app.,2021 left my mind in ruins, so I decided to rebuild it. This app helped a lot and I recommend it to everyone. My girlfriend joined in and now we meditate together, it really is a wonderful app that helps with a wide variety. Take care of yourself, get this app.,I didn’t believe it!!! But one sleep story is all it took to make me a believer! The sleep stories on Calm, are like a warm cup of milk before bed. They relax you at first and then your drifting off to sleep before the story ends. Try it and you won’t be disappointed!,Downloaded the app yesterday and it was working great, but next day the Scenes sounds stopped working. I select Jasper Lake, silence. Fireplace, silence. Foggy Stream, silence. I don’t know why there’s no sound. The stories work. Meditation works. Just Scenes has no sound.,I’ve heard many great things about this app and was excited to try it. The one free meditation I tried was great, and when I saw they were offering 60% off the lifetime subscription I decided to go for it. Unfortunately the payment would not process. I talked to my bank who assured me something wasn’t set up right on Calm’s end. Calm assured me it was my bank. The app was good, but not so much so that the run around is worth it. App deleted.,This app is inspiring, creative & very much appreciated. I especially am grateful to your intentionality of presenting mindfulness in a variety of ways that are inclusive of both a novice and an experienced practitioner; the sweet way it invites us to have compassion for all beings and the diversity of folks who contribute.  simply awesome😊❤️👍🏾,So, I was having problems sleeping, so my Mom got me this for my iPad, and it was the best choice ever. Now when I have a problem sleeping, or with anything, I just open this. I am a true fan of Tamara Levitt. This is the best app ever. Thank you for reading this!,As a 911 dispatcher, I really needed this. I can’t believe I waited so long to purchase. Some days are better than others but this app helps my body and mind calm after a bad call or just a down right stressful day. A+++ Rating!,This app has great potential for meditation. I would absolutely love to use it for sleep because I really need help sleeping. However I cannot use the sleep meditation here because the narrators are talking so loud and with such excitement that you feeling you are being screamed at. Not what you are looking for while trying to sleep. Please find some nice soothing voices so I can give it another shot.,I like this app, but wish I could create a playlist of sleep stories.  Some of them are too short to work as sleep stories for me, so it would be nice to be able to line up two or three.,This app has helped me with my anxiety, stress, and at times depression. I highly recommend to get the premium membership. I was having such a bad headache and i knew this app would help “calm” my mind. So, i made my favorite dessert and I’m played “Desert Skye” by Rob Alan Cohen. I feel amazing now... haha :),I really love this app, it has everything you need. If you’re an athlete it has sports meditations, and sleep stories and ones calming stress and anxiety. There are varieties of things you might like! And so much to explore. Pleas add more ASMR sleep stories by Emma reads red and Paris ASMR! They are so relaxing,I used to use this app on a daily basis in high school because of the breathing exercise features to help with anxiety, unfortunately over the years some of they’re most basic features have been locked for they’re subscription, so if your a broke college kid like me and don’t have 70$ to spend a year this is a complete waste of time.,The sleep stories help me fall asleep so quickly! Sometimes, when I lay in bed my mind races and I can’t get settled. I’ll put on a sleep story and I won’t get halfway through before I’m asleep. I’m trying meditation but I like it so far.,I woke up in the middle of the night and was having a hard time falling back asleep. I turned on the bedtime stories and listened to one with Matthew McConaughey and I was asleep within 10 minutes. Thank you Calm!,I like the app but why is VIP it’s just too much like why do you have to have almost everything VIP could you please remove the feature and have VIP for only famous starred people. Stop being capitalistic, at least make VIP cheaper.,I left for approximately a year to try Headspace’s subscription. It was good but not as good as Calm. I renewed my subscription with you again this morning. Thanks for taking me back! Now let’s get this show started! 🥰,I don’t know if it’s a bug but it stops playing when the screen is locked sometimes,The lastest update got rid of “My ❤️” tab on the top bar, which gave me easy access to my favorites. This is inconvenient when I have to scroll down the screen to access them now. Please put it back to the top bar,The initial log in can be a bit annoying with a coupon, but you can’t beat this app otherwise. Great meditations, star meditators (is that even a word?), overall a great fit for its intended purpose. Try the free trial and see for yourself.,I have only used this app for 2 days! I have had better sleep. I feel more focused and relaxed. I feel like this is going to be a big part of my life from now on!!,I love the sleep stories!!  I like the meditation and strive to practice every day to remap my brain.  It would be great if there were other guides with different voices for the daily meditation - maybe some British, Caribbean or South African accents?  I get tired if tamaras voice,Two stars manly\\nBecause the design of app is very clean and professional.I have sleep Insomnia and have tried many different ways to sleep. I don’t see a purpose for this app. It doesn’t work and the stories are often too long and I often get bored and just annoyed at listening. You can find The music almost everywhere and anyway.,Different natural sounds to help you sleep, a meditation and story section, I’m loving this app. Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to start the day off with a clear focus or end it with a stress release session. 👍🏽👍🏽,I love the calm app. Most used app by far. But I’m leaving a review now because I’m tired of the scenes never playing for me which is the feature I use the most. I have to delete the app, redownload it and log in again. Then download all the scenes I like to use the best. Kind of a pain. Second time in a week. What gives?,I payed for the year because honestly I didn\\'t read much when signing up for the free trail. Tried to cancel and get my money back (supeeeer expensive by the way) never used it. Might as well listen to free podcast. \\nI don’t recommend it read carefully or be aware of signing up with the right email so you receive notifications when they’re charging you 70 dollars for the annual fee.,I love this app and have used it for awhile. I love the new update as well, however very few things are free anymore. I do not mind at all to pay for this amazing app, but it is $80 a year and they do not give an option to pay per month. More people could afford this if it wasn’t a lump payment of $80.,Love the app, but I wish all the sleep selections came with the choice for music on or music off. For me, the music is distracting and often too loud to hear the author’s words. I find the versions with no music more relaxing, but know others enjoy it, so having a choice would be wonderful.,This app has so many features, and so calming. I had it for more than a year now, and till this day I still use it. I love the soundscapes, my favorite as it helps my environment to be peaceful. I really recommend to anyone !,Used it everyday since I got it ...health insurance even pays for it. Helped so much with anxiety and borderline personality disorder. If you want a REAL free month trial BUY one of the PUZZLES (at Walmart) it comes with 30 day trial and see how amazing this app is for yourself or gift it to someone else! :),So I have a lot to say about this, but it’s late and I’m tired.\\n\\nI have insomnia and I could never sleep. I came across this app and it did wonders for me.\\n\\nIf I got into a fight with a friend, or parents this app helped me calm down.\\n\\nI get panic attacks with weather phenomenons, and this is helping me slowly get over it.\\n\\nI write about my day on it every night before I go to bed, and the routine helps signal to my body that it’s time to go to sleep.\\n\\nI am so glad I downloaded this app. It has helped me so much. THANKS CALM!!!!🥺😍😍😍🥰😇🤗🤗🤗,To be honest, this app is absolutely great !\\nBut sometimes when you think you cannot get the premium version, just because you live in this trash country (Iran) , it makes me cry…\\nEnjoy! premium users :),Amazing! Puts me to sleep every night! I wish I could get a free year as it is expensive and the competition is testing me. My subscription is up on the 14th so I will see if I renew. Most stories are best without the famous people but the calm voices!,Maddeningly, the music will not continue from song to song in an “album” when my AirPods are connected. It doesn’t matter if the screen is locked out the app is open—it consistently reverts back to the “scene music” after a first track in a selected album is played. Fatal flaw in an otherwise great app with great content. It’s just an absolutely awful music player.,It’s not the best because you need a subscription to listen to sleep story’s and other things it’s really hard for me to find a story that I don’t need a subscription for so if there were more story’s that don’t require a subscription then the app would be a lot better but I see lots of potential for this app,Extremely relaxing! I’m unable to stay awake long enough to hear a full story because I’m immediately put to sleep. I no longer need to rely on melatonin. Please add more fictional stories narrated by celebrities.,Jeff\\'s Daily Trip is the main reason I have this app. His easy-going style is the first meditation that has worked for me. High price but ultimately worth it.\\n\\nPros\\n· Jeff\\n· Lots of choices for background sounds\\n· Great exclusive bedtime stories and songs\\n· Sleep timer built-in\\n\\nCons\\n· Price\\n· Limited content\\n· I wish there was an easier way to filter content. Example: I want to see all of Jeff\\'s stuff or I only want to see new items.\\n· No playlist option, only a favorites list.,These days it’s been pretty hard to sleep but the sleep stories help me a lot so thank you come for being there for me💤💤😁🧚🏻\\u200d♀️🐶🐱🐶🐨🦄oh my stuff is think so too they like it to help them get to sleep.,They have an amazing variety of sleep stories that help if you can’t get your mind to stop racing at night. I would love if you guys would continue doing Wind in the Willows chapters!!,I have been a Calm devotee of several years now during the pandemic, Tamara Levitt\\nHas become increasingly important to my well being.\\n\\nThis month I have now tried twice\\nTo update and co to ie with her daily meditations . I have been charged and updated, but continue ha one the meditation. Get stuck on a day or two previous. It is making me even more anxious and I have no idea what is up.\\n\\nPlease...can one of your techs help, soon, or I will have to completely drop my favorite\\nApt.\\n\\nPeggy Hubbard,It\\'s taken me some time to really get in the habit of using this app, but I\\'m glad I finally did. The selection of music and stories and everything, there\\'s bound to be something for everyone on here,Calm is extremely frustrating. It comes across as free and some lessons you have to pay to get access to. But it lets you listen to a few free ones, then every exercise you click asks you to upgrade to listen to. It’s super sneaky and not transparent in how it tries to get you to upgrade. Just note if you want a free meditation app with an option to upgrade to get access to additional lessons, calm is not for you.,It is so important with  my life full of joy,  and full of difficulty  that I take the time for a little calm. I love this app there is something fun for everyone. Thank you everyone who gives to us through the app. Martine,I was convinced I’d only do the 7 day free trial but this app is incredible, and I’ll be purchasing the full year. It helps me drift to sleep more easily and has a ton of great features like mindfulness and music. Highly recommend.,Calm is one of my favorite apps for myself and my children. There are so many resources to help you relax. My children love the sleep stories. I love everything! Definitely an app that you should get to ease worry, frustration and tension.,I have always enjoyed meditation and Calm provides great opportunities to expand my practice. Now Jeff Warren is a part of Calm and I couldn’t be happier!  He is by far my favorite teacher.  Looking forward to more meditations with him.,I use this app almost every night helps me sleep so much better I can’t thank you enough Keith urban for your contribution to the site everyone should try listening to this,I had been debating for over a year whether to try this app or not. I decided to go for it. Oh have a high stress job and this app has been a wonderful experience to let go of a lot of that stress.,O stars\\n\\nI heard about this app on a morning news program, read the great reviews so I downloaded it. Then I read the privacy policy and said no thanks.\\nIn order to use all the features of this app you have have to agree to allow cookies not only from the app developer but from third parties too. I don’t allow cookies. Your information is shared with 3rd parties you know nothing about!  If you are giving them personal information - especially medical info it is not private. \\n\\nWith the recent problems multiple websites have had with people’s personal info being collected by 3rd parties I no longer trust anyone to keep my data safe so this app is deleted from my phone.,I have no idea where to begin but I completely love this app. It is a must have and I know you will not regret this choice. 10/10 would definitely recommend.,I’ve been fraudulently charged two years now for this app after I canceled it. I confirmed with Apple I haven’t used it since 2018, and the calm website and their customer service confirmed I don’t have a subscription. I’m still trying to get my money back. It is definitely not worth $60 a year which is why I didn’t want it. Everything it offers you can get for free from podcasts.,I’ve been a paid subscriber for two years and use this daily. But the recent redesign it harder to find what I want; it’s cluttered with too many categories (“mental fitness”). The app is too pushy about promoting categories I don’t use/don’t care for. Allow users to design their own menu.,Omg I love this app! It has awesome sleep stories by awesome narrators! Its also is worth the extra money you can put into it. I put the money into it and I always fall right asleep. the breathing exercises are amazing! I hope you install it! Enjoy!,I have come to love meditation and calm is the one that has brought this peace into my life by teaching me. I had to start small and now I can meditate up to 30 mins and want more. It helps me with my daily life everyday.,This app is the best money I’ve ever spent. In just a couple months of using it I’ve begun a meditation practice, slept better and even helped my sleepless 7 year old get to sleep at a normal hour.,I really enjoy using this app almost on a nightly basis. 1 recommendation in an area to expand is your sleep stories nap selection. I really like this feature as I am woken up rather easily due to how you structure the recordings. It would be nice if you had a larger variety.,This is an awesome app that has helped me get to sleep faster than I have been able to in over 5 years. But...I would love to be able to cue up several sleep stories to play back to back, so that I don’t have to look up a new sleep story.,Complete waste of money. Didn’t find anything calming about it. Maybe it works for some people but not me. I was expecting more from it but really only found various audio recordings you have to listen to for 30+ mins a day. It doesn’t help that it auto billed after the trial and I had to pay for a year. Try the free trial but watch out for the re-bill like any other free trial.,I’ve been doing meditation and mindfulness the past 7 years, and this is hands-down the best mindfulness app out there. Cultivate your inner peace, and tranquility by consistently using this app. Love it! This is one of my dream companies to work for someday.,I am learning how to remain in the moment during meditation. I am relaxing and staying focused on my breath. I feel relieved and calm . I am enjoying the time with being with myself. Peace comes over me in the moments of meditation!,Calm is my best friend in the morning.  I typically awake with anxiety. The lessons in this app have been very helpful in allowing me to get my day started on a positive note.   Generally, when the anxiety returns during the day, I can turn to the calm app and relieve it.,What did you do with my library of saved meditations? The \"heart\" option was removed from the channel/category area, and now all of my saved content is gone. Is there a fix for this? I have 385 mindful days, bru; please let me keep the meditations that got me there. \\nI loved the ux before this update, and can’t see paying for reduced or limited access.,I think sleep and mental health is very important so I like that part of the app. On the other hand I wish when you enter the week free trial, the app automatically chose the 1 week subscription, not the 1 year. That aside, the app is nice, the voice actors and stories are awesome so 4/5.,It gives me just what I need in the time I want. If I just have 1-2 minutes, I can do a check on what I’m grateful for. If I can’t fall asleep, the sleep stories are perfect! If I have a bit longer, I can do a meditation.,This app is great for dealing with stress. It would be five stars if it didn’t have two thing. One, it will ask you to allow it to send reminders to you. Don’t do it. Two, almost nothing is free. It will ask for premium. This app need to be free or it will fail.,I downloaded Calm because my dad died I an accident before I was born, and my mom is dating. when she kisses her boyfriend it reminds me of my dad. So it makes me stressed. \\nI did the first meditation session, it was good, but then I went to the second one... oh right, you have to pay to be not stressed.\\nI understand the premium is how y’all make money, but it’s not fair. Most of the content is locked, but you have to pay to get it.\\nI am one of those millions of people out there who have stress. So I deleted Calm and downloaded Headspace. \\nHeadspace has sooooo much more free content, and it has workouts and things called energy shots to wake you up. \\nHeadspace: 5 stars\\nCalm: 2 stars\\nSorry:),I really wanted to try this app but there’s no way to do so without signing up. I found one meditation but that was all. There’s a 7 day free trial but you have to subscribe and then cancel or you can get it for a cheaper price in the email you get but then there’s no 7 day trial, you pay up front. If there’s a way to use this app for free without giving permission to charge my card I’d love for someone to let me in on the secret.,My first year’s subscription is about to end, but I’m not sad at all—because I’m renewing Calm for sure!! The Daily Calm helps center me and Sleep Stories put me to sleep (most nights). Highly recommend Calm to one and all!!,Calm has great content. Unfortunately whenever I use this app my phone overheats. This does not happen with any other app. Not sure why this is the case.\\n\\nThis wasn’t happening till a few months back. So I’m guessing a recent update has introduced this issue.,This app is amazing!! So I have recently been having trouble sleeping but now I use some meditations on calm and I’m asleep within 15 minutes! So if you are having trouble sleeping definitely get Calm!!!,The app is great. But this Tamara woman has a really annoying voice that sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me, and so many of the meditations are narrated by her. \\n\\nI wish there was a way to filter by narrator, so I could search for meditations without her.,I am so tired of apps saying they are free, just to find out you need to pay for a subscription. I downloaded the app hoping to get some relaxed sleep, to find out I have to premium with a subscription. With one option for a free story. I don’t expect everything to be free, but when it says it is I expect it to be. At least have more than one free story.,I still use this every night for a sleep story and then sleep sounds but there used to be so many more free sleep stories! Unless they’ve hidden them; I can only find the one I favorited a few years ago; the rest require a paid subscription.,I like having an app to fall asleep but this app went about it in my opinion the wrong way I want to hear from people in the story’s where their voices help to relax and fall asleep. All the app cares about is famous voices and it’s not working out for me. Not gonna buy and also not gonna recommend unless something changes soon,I’m an anxious person — and life has thrown a few curve balls lately. The guided meditations and sleep stories have truly helped me think more clearly and rest easier.,I have the lifetime membership but not really sure what extras that gives me. For\\nWhat the cost is , I feel their are quite a few other apps that offer better stories for less the cost. Calm doesn’t add new stories enough, seems the same stories have been on forever,There’s so much content and it makes my anxiety disappear for a little bit and let me feel relaxed. Well worth the price. I deducted a star because my phone gets so hot while I’m using the app, so I can’t use it for long periods at a time.,For nearly 2 years now Calm has lulled me to sleep when sleep would not come. It is teaching me the skills to meditate and calm my world. It is teaching me tools to keep my body mind and spirit healthy in a chaotic world.,Thank goodness for everything that being everything and the way it was for me.,I’ve always had trouble sleeping, but lately it’s been getting worse. Then, I got calm, and everything got better. I listen to a story every night now!,I love the app. The only thing is how much stuff cost premium. I can’t afford spending money to be relaxed. And if the developers could add a free category so it’s easier to find what I can do. :),I do the daily meditation every morning, I’ve definitely seen improvement in my patience and just learning to live in the now peacefully. It’s obvious now on days I don’t get up to meditate .,I never get through the whole story and that’s good! I have a very difficult time falling asleep. Anxiety and thoughts. This app has helped me to gravitate back to simple thinking. 💕,Meditation is essential to your overall health. Calm has several options of meditation to focus on a variety of subjects. I find them all useful, as I commit to meditating twice a day.,This app is amazing It can help you with your sleep meditation and everything else download this app right now if you’re interested and by the way this is not a robot this is an actual human being,In addition to the exceptional & comprehensive collection of meditation materials, there is also a huge selection of kids bedtime stories and soothing soundscapes. I Love it! and the whole family uses Calm.,I recently fiiiiinally got the app.... after a year or so of thinking about it. I am happy with the mobile options... but I wish the AppleTV app had the same options. I would love to loop the soundscape options overnight,It’s challenging in the free version without using the 7 day free trial to see if the premium would be beneficial.  \\n\\nI used the story blue gold to fall asleep and it worked like a charm.  I was sleeping before the story ended.  The daily check-ins are nice.  But other than those two aspects, the free version does not offer much more.,Amazing way to do guided meditation. I also like how they have unguided meditation because sometimes the talking is too much. I also like how they have other races of people as narrators. For example I really enjoy Lebron James video. More diverse narrators would be awesome. Meditate everyday y’all,Earned the subscription price on the first night, ten minutes into Turtle Dreams and my normally chaotic five year old was passed out. Best purchase in a long time; and I actually bought the app for me!!,I was looking far like 20 minutes and I could not do anything because we needed calm premium and it is really expensive 70 dollars a month!? Please stop making everything premium I still love the app,I find that the app has generally good content and the meditation timer is functional. However, as stated in the developers privacy statement they record tons of personal data about you. They don’t specifically state how they use the information. The developer’s creepy behavior precludes me ever using the app again.,Calm is helping me a lot in managing my stress, giving me relaxation and peace of mind. I notice I can control my temper more and relationships with family members are better. I feel more focused. Thank you, Calm. And thank you, Kaiser Permanente for introducing me to Calm!,I really wish there were more options when it came to who’s guiding the different meditations. The majority of them are lead by Tamara who has really bad vocal fry which is not soothing. I always switch to John when possible. I’d love if every series had multiple narrators to choose from.,Pay close attention if you try free subscription, you will automatically be charged even if you cancel. You will need to request refund through Apple, Calm is not responsible for billing on iOS. You will need to complete unsubscribe within 30 days after you are charged and fight with Apple for refund.\\n\\nCalm has no customer support through iOS.,This is such a great little app except that once again there is another hand in my wallet waiting to be paid. That sort of counters the positive vibes you receive from the app. 🤔 So many of the features are locked in the free version. I realize that other people have to make a living but good grief 🤦🏼\\u200d♀️! It’s always something! 🤬,I like be this app it helps when my stress level is high (it’s always high) The only problem I have with this app is that you have to have calm premium if you want to do most of the stuff. But other than that this game is the best! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,Stop the ads targeting people with phobias. I never write reviews, but I felt compelled, since this was an especially nasty marketing strategy. Initially terrifying someone isn’t a way to get them to try your product. Whoever thought sewing immediate distrust would endear potential consumers should be fired. Life is stressful enough during this pandemic, and I don’t need a jump scare while scrolling to make my day even more so.,His teaching technique and voice are perfect for me to learn this gift. I have been a bit intermittent but I return to this class and have repeated some lessons and moved forward. Thank you Jeff and thank you Calm.,I’m changing my rating- my subscription was NOT automatically renewed. I was sent an email reminder with the option of renewal, so I have no complaint. \\n\\nI really enjoyed the train journeys through different countries!,I really enjoyed this app for me it is a great way to settle my mind and fall asleep every night. I do wish that Emma Whispers Red did some more stories I just love that soothing whisper at night.,This app helps so much and I love it so much! The adjectives and words that are used truly set the story and the voices are so calming. There are things for different types of people sleep stories and meditation.,I didn’t expect for this to work... \\nbut after a couple days of the how to meditate course, and listening to the sounds of nature from this app I feel calm.,This app has really helped me. I’m new to mediation. I wax actually kinda skeptical about all this. It really works though. I feel more at ease with myself even when stressed out .,I downloaded this app to help me sleep, but all the additional features has made me a better person. It has also helped me sleep at night. 5 stars,This is such an AMAZING app to let your mind go to ease, or calm down. I really love it because it helps you out with anxiety! It also puts stuff into different sections so you can check them out!,Great app. Although there are few bugs content is great. Today however it won’t load at all after upgrading. Any fix?,Nice app would give it 5 stars; but needs more free content or clarity on a 1 time purchase. Now is the time for people to have less stress and not worry about recurring payments and unwanted future credit card charges!!,I love calm it makes me fall asleep so easy like if I try a different app the helps people fall asleep supper easy i try it never works but when I use calm I fall a sleep in one second and that is why i prefer calm,Great app and well worth the price. Lots of content to choose from.\\n\\nSUGGESTION: you should add a place to favorite a meditation on the screen that pops up once the meditation is finished, not just during the meditation.,I absolutely loved meditating, or the beginning of it. The calm and wonderful feeling is not short lived. I will be doing this every day to see the difference at the end of month!,I use Calm everyday and night. It really helps me in these stressful times. I love the sleep stories. I would not have made it through this last year without Calm.  I am very thankful.,My family and I struggle with mental health, calm has saved us, from bedtime stories for the kids to guided meditation for me. It’s been a godsend! Truly I think doing these guided practices has saved my life.,So my problem is you have to pay for it my mom is kinda wasting 100 dollars on this because she uses it and I use it and soon she will waste 150 for on my other iPad so pls make it cheaper for it bc 1% use?! SO BAD so pls make it cheaper,I haven’t been able to log in for days because of the new update. Please fix,,I’ve had this downloaded for a while so I could try it and I barley started using it and I absolutely loveeeee it😁!Ive always had trouble sleeping and this puts me to sleep,calms me down a lot and it helps my anxiety💕!,Love the app, very helpful and lots of options. However, there are no visual-only meditations. Not only is this inaccessible for Deaf/HoH users, but also anyone trying to use the app while a partner sleeps beside them. It would be great if you could add some visual meditations and breathing guides.,Mostly everything is locked so stop trying to make money and start trying to make lives better please I am only 12 and I have lots of problems sleeping 💤 at night everything looks good in this app but a lot is locked that I would like to try,The guided meditations are very helpful for helping you find your center and clear away stray thoughts. The guides are very soothing and their advice is helpful. Probably the best of many meditation apps I’ve tried.,I am sorry but I am not going to pay $70 every year for this. I am very unhappy that you will charge this amount for someone not to be stressed out or have anxiety because this can cause anxiety. You have most everything locked which means that you want the people who are getting this app to buy it. It is very misleading to make people think that this is a free app but once you get the app it is not free.,It’s been hard to be inspired over the last few years. I feel like I’m coming back to myself listening to all these artists and healers. Loving this app ❤️,I was relaxing into the sleep app only to have a loud slick advertisement jolt me awake telling me how wonderful it was that I was using the free version. I’m sure they were going to next suggest I get the paid version so I would not have to be rudely yanked out of my deep relaxation state but I yanked off my earbuds so as not to be auditorily assulted while trying to sleep 😞 (PS: and now I cannot post this because I don’t remember my ‘nickname ‘),This app is fantastic! I struggle with depression and anxiety and the sounds and exercises have really started to help me ground myself. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for ways to help meditate, focus, sleep, stay calm, etc.,I love the Calm app! I use it for multiple purposes, but there is something there for whatever I need in that moment. I love the check in feature and the accessibility of meditations.,First of all it seems like a great app, however there is literally nothing I can even try out, because everything is locked. You need to pay to unlock it. I am a basketball player, and I really wanted to watch the lebron series on the mind. I could only watch the intro to the series, which was very disappointing.,They make you enter your email to sign up so I did but left the sign up half done while I thought some more about signing up due to the cost. Next day I had like 25 junk emails from solicitors. Since then I have been getting like 10-15 junk emails. I had never had this problem before until I entered my email in this app. Just wanted to share this observation.,Calm helps me to sleep, helps with my anxieties, helps when I just need me time, I love the stories, honestly the stories always put me into a deep sleep! Meditation is now enjoyable! It’s just overall a great app!!,I’ve been using this app for over 6 months. I’ve used the meditations, sleep stories but mostly soundscapes for sleeping. I really like a variety but I’d like more! How about spring peeper frogs? Cicadas? Thanks!,This app is good, but most of it is locked. Only one thing is actually unlocked on this app. At least on sleep. I would love to give this more stars but there is so little you can do without paying. It’s just not worth it to get so little things free.,I absolutely love this it calms me when i feeling a little off i have nothing to say so bye and remember this is the best app i recommend downloading if you feel off sometimes😷,I love 💕 it helps me know how much i’m going through know matter how i’m feeling i Need Calm more than  Now having a New least on life with a Stem Cell Transplant  🙏 i’m a New Approved Person and Calm got me through it All 😊,I am changing companies and have been feeling very anxious. I just performed a meditation session and I feel so much better. I’m thankful that this works so well! Looking forward to continuing.,Was trying calm out to see how relaxed I would get and this app is amazing. It even has daily check in’s for you to submit how you’re feeling. :),This has happened 3 times in a row. I\\'ve looked for a related setting, but none exists. I can successfully resume the story, but it kind of breaks the mood. I will probably stop using the app until it is fixed.,I really like the story Matthew McConaughey told. I like the sound of the water so far so good I just wasn’t ready to go to sleep. When I begin to collaborate with it rather than fight it I’m sure it will be helpful. Mary Lou Long/Olson/Deising,I love it cus it lets me sleep with a picture in my head it  is so calm And smoothing I love this app I’m 9 and I love every single one definitely one of my favorites are the jass ones I love it 5 out of 5 stars ok I’m going to listen to it by😜🤗💤😴,I tried to cancel my trial on the last day of it. It was too late and I got charged 70 bucks. I requested a refund that day and did not get one. I’ve tried to get into the app, the sleep stories are painfully bad. It just irritates me when I’m trying to fall asleep. I don’t like the meditations and they clearly paid Lebron James a lot of money to endorse the app. \\n\\nPlease refund my money and I’ll take down the review.\\n\\n-David,I was really looking for this thing to help me sleep but you need to have a membership to access every thing there is one story that’s free but the guys voice is to scratchy and nerve racking so I don’t recommend downloading if you don’t have money to spend on a pointless app,It’s helped me so much but one thing I would like more is kid sleep stories and stuff to calm me down with panic attacks! But I do love all the things it has on the app. Thank you for providing me something to help my sleeping problems! Thank you!!,Thanks so much for helping me to manage my breathing and to meditate.  This is a stressful time for me this year.  Family members and the pandemic we\\'re in.  I can find my own kind of Peace for the moment through \"calm\".  🦋\\n\\nTerrie W.,I have struggled with sleep my entire life but didn’t realize my pattern was not normal until the pandemic made it very overwhelming last year. The Calm app helps me drift off to sleep with a quiet mind.,Useful with one downside which is we can’t use the subscription in our family sharing.,This is an excellent overall app. But please fix the issue of background ambient noise suddenly coming on without the app even being open. It is the exact opposite of the calming effect intended by the app.,Make more things without premium because some people need this but Can’t afford it. Like the kids stuff pls.,Even after starting the paid version, the experience of this app is full of pop ups, unwanted suggestions, notifications, and way too many options. I like the beginner’s guide to meditation and would pay for that as a stand-alone, and am leaning towards cancelling my subscription before the free trial’s up.,I have been using it for over 6 months I really love it. I’m a little frustrated now I just updated and now it’s not opening 🤬,I love the Sleep Stories and truly can’t fall asleep without it!  My only issue is the app often quits right after I’ve started a story. I’ve run updates and nothing seems to work.,First, I had trouble getting the “free trial” version of the app - it really tries to steer you to paying the $70 upfront, which isn’t great. Then, the app froze several times initially, not responding when I clicked on different options. So far I’ve had to re-start my phone to get it to work; fingers crossed that it improves- so far it’s caused more stress than the calm that’s promised ☹️,I have been using this app for well over three years. It has helped me through my journey of anxiety, and success in weight loss.,He didn’t tell us how he feels calmer or maybe he did but I don’t feel calmer but I like his voice. I would give him 4 stars but since I like himself I’m a fan I give him 5 stars.,Amazing app. I wake far too often in the middle of the night. This puts me right back to sleep. My only request is for an entire library of Cillian Murphy readings. His voice is pure Kerry Gold butter.,Today’s meditation on perfectionism hit home. I feel so much better about releasing my need to be the best at everything I do. I will have to remind myself daily of this feeling.,Everything is so calming about this app!\\nFrom the background u can click it \\nand it changes sounds 🌱 it’s peaceful so much to explore !! A great substitute for games or social media.,This is my second year. I’m enjoying the daily meditations and sleep stories. During this pandemic it is important to create balance and perspective.,Take it from me, buying the subscription is worth it. But if you just want to download this without buying, you really can’t do anything.,I have been using Calm for sleep for a while now and I love it. There are no adds, a lot of sleep and meditation stories and much much more. I\\'d give this app a 10/10.,Awesome app for sleep issues. It’s also very helpful with stress relief. Meditation is also included. But their is also a premium account included but it is totally worth it!,I can’t imagine paying $70+ a year on any other app in the App Store. But this app is worth it. If you value your sleep, give it a go. \\nI would love to see more classic stories like Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh, etc.,I like the 10 min length. I had not listened to a Calm meditation in months during the pandemic. It was nice this morning to hear the mountain lake sounds again and be led through a quiet but helpful lesson.,One of those apps that has the potential to actually improve your life for the better.,I am so very disappointed, I have been a member paid in full since 2018 and I use this app every day. For the last three days I have been unable to open the app ....... my subscription is not due to be renewed until June 2021. Why am I not able to open the app?\\nWho do I contact to get this rectified? Why are my emails not being answered?,Every night I select a bed time story and it helps me quickly fall asleep. Not only but I also enjoy the sleeping meditations which also help me calm my mind and sleep.,I normally don’t mind apps that cost money to get better performance or no adds or something like that, but when I say nothing I mean nothing, you literally can’t do any on the app without buying the subscription, like NOTHING.. I like the concept but wish there was a version that you don’t have to pay for,Calm has vastly improved my sleep. I am favorably impressed with the quality of offerings and have highly recommended it to friends.,This aap helps me get through my day. I am more aware, grateful, hopeful because it’s almost as though I have a friend checking on me and rooting me on through my anxieties. So grateful for this app,It\\'s been a great start so far. Dropping 1 star because the Apple TV app doesn\\'t actually login to my account so my progress isn\\'t reflected on other devices.,Thank you. I’ve used premium twice and it has already paid for itself,Well I was very excited when I saw the ad about this app calm. Mainly because I really needed it but you have to pay for it and personally I would love to make an app jus like this but make it free for people because I would rather help people then make them pay me to help them. I don’t like this app and hopefully you’ll make more stuff free and help people like me out. Worst app.,I just updated the app and now it won’t work!! Please fix this soon. I use this app every night to fall asleep 😭,I helps me sleep sense I had a hard time getting it and my mom told me that it even existed and I tried it and I didn’t even stop using it I really recommend this app.,I had this app for a long time and regularly used some of the free music to relax. But then just recently everything I had marked as favorite was suddenly locked. Every. Single. One. Very disappointing so I regrettably had to uninstall the app because paying for apps just isn’t within my reach. So I guess if you can pay for the subscription then it’s worth it.,New to calm and enjoying so far, but please add more options for the voices. Very frustrating that almost everything is by the same woman. I like Jeff warrens voice. Please get more meditations by him, as soon as possible. Thank you.,Used to love this app but the update got rid of my monthly calendar that showed green dots for every meditation session which helped to motivate me. Also new and annoying is the repeated screens suggesting I share or invite others to use the app. I would rather just use the app and monitor my monthly progress on the old calendar in peace.,Too soon to say for sure but the meditation practice alone has opened and relaxed my mind just using for a week. Well done!,It’s like being a part of another persons conversation. Sometimes the voices sound like AI and there’s an algorithm that mimics whatever content the user is searching. \\n\\nOverall, it’s convenient & short.,This app would be good if all the stuff wasn’t locked sure some of the things are useful but the thing is that almost nothing is useful for my sleep because I feel like the app don’t care on the people who need it and can’t afford it like me true to make some of the stuff not locked,I experienced serious panic attacks and anxiety for the first time in my life during the pandemic. This app helped in a huge way to reduce those feelings. It has been a powerful healing tool for me.,This app has helped me so much this last year. Grateful for all the different options available to meditate and find calm.,Awesome content. Sleepstories for our kids is incredible. Even the the white noise options are extremely well made. The issue I have is how awful the app is. Tons of glitches, long load times, and crashes. Really a poorly coded app. Doesn’t matter if I’m on WiFi, cellular, or an iPad Pro. Just a subpar app.,I downloaded calm because I have sleeping problems, and my doctor thought it was a good idea to get calm. When I went on the sleep tab to help me sleep, almost everything in stories was locked,  everything in soundscape, and  everything in music. So I give this app a two out of five.,I use and like the sleep stories, but the narrator of most of the daily content is always the same person - Tamara Leavitt. I find her voice so annoying I can’t stand to listen. She’s everywhere in the ap, so other people must love her, but for me she’s like nails on a chalkboard. I wish they would vary the narrator.,I purchased one of their puzzles and they do not make you calm while doing it and I was supposed to get a free 30 day subscription for the app by buying this puzzle, NO FREE SUBSCRIPTION! False advertisement. Will not be buying their puzzles or downloading the app again. Also everything needs the subscription so if you aren’t willing to pay $70 a year don’t buy!,Best money I ever spent to help with anxiety, and insomnia. The sleep stories are wonderful. So relaxing! I’m just learning to meditate and the classes and meditations are spot on. To the developers at Calm-well done and more sleep stories from Chiké please!!,I am suppose to have a free year of calm, but I don’t have it. Every time I try to listen to anything, it says it is a 7 day trail. I give up!\\nI am very disappointed.,This app doing the 7 days of you deciding if you really want to keep the app does not have much helpful anything on it to help soothe you for sleep. You have to pay a full subscription just to decide if this is an app you want to keep over time. I’d never recommend this app to anyone. It’s almost like a scam.,The app is pretty good and so are the episodes but there isn’t much you can listen too unless you pay them.,So why they are trying to tell us that with in app purchases is really the only way to get calm. I think that is ridiculous, but there commercial is what got us here in the first place. Boo on this we thought this was gonna be a fun thing to use. We were wrong. My anxiety is building but I can’t get it to calm because of in app purchases, oh well it was worth a try.,I don’t have much time, because I have to go to sleep soon. But I can make ☝️ comment. I love that it puts me to sleep very quickly!❤️❤️❤️! Anyway, goodnight😴,My calm app has been randomly starting without me opening the app. It starts playing my chosen background noise, and the only way to stop it is my restarting the whole app. It’s happening several times a day, and is honestly getting pretty disruptive. If they fix the bug, I would rate it at 4 stars.,It basically requires a payment to use. Without paying, you’ll find little to no available options, but it definitely is calming,So get me this strait I’m all just “ugh I can’t sleep I should get calm”BUT NOPE instead if I want the best sleep I have to pay for the best sleep like really?I want to listen to story’s and such but then I can just listen to calm music so is this helpful to me?no only people that are willing to use their money one this app will actually like this but still it’s just-why would you do this,I was never one to believe in this sort of stuff. I struggle with anxiety and the exercises on this app have helped me so much! Everyone should be using this every day!,Mental health issue apps should be free. I love this app, but you shouldn’t have to spend so much money for the experience. I feel like so many people aren’t getting the help and meditation they need because of how much it costs.,Love everything about the app. It’s my one stop shop to recenter and find my balance. Meditation, stories, music , and so much more...,Will\\nDefinitely recommend to all people even if you go to sleep easily. The music is calming and I always learn something new listening to Alan Sklar. Sorry If I spelled\\nIt wrong.,This app is the best thing two relax me so far out of the many many times I’ve tried to calm down if I was you I would 100% get it,My favorites are probably the sleep stories. Every time I put one on I never get to hear the end!,This app used to be great they had at least some “free content” but that’s no longer the case.      Even the free content is locked now! They just want you to shell out money. They do have nice content though. It would have been nice if not everything was locked.,It takes a while for the app to open.  I waited for 5 minutes and nothing.,I cannot give this app enough praise.  I am a faithful user who has found it to be tremendously helpful on so many levels.  This is a great investment and I wholeheartedly recommend it!,I use to love this app it use to help me fall asleep but when I went to go use again everything was locked and I to pay premium I wish it was for free I rather have an app after very mediation than having everything locked.,I love the app and use it almost daily.\\nI would really like to use the meditation features but they all have the same guide, Tamara something, and I *cannot* stand her voice.\\nSuch a shame that all this meditation content was made with only one guide.,Love the content of the app, but I have a lot issues with the app kicking me out of my account and telling me it doesn’t have internet connection when all other apps work and have full bars.,I’ve never slept better. The sleep stories help me clear my brain and I usually drift off before it even ends. Highly recommend!!,Calm has helped me so much fall asleep and have less anxiety and I have a rush stress around my family and friends it helps me so much calm myself down when I’m angry sad or mad,I really do love Calm, BUT I have now been a member for a few years and I am getting to know some of the daily meditation recordings pretty well. They are good, so not bad to listen to repetitively. But at the same time, I wish there was more new material. Same for the night sleep music.,You used to be able to have a free option in every category. I had to search for five minutes until I found one free option. Absolutely ridiculous that you force everyone to subscribe.  You could offer 10% of the recording and ask people to pay after that free snipit. \\n\\nGo download another app. Seriously,I live alone, I enjoy all of that calm allows me to try. I take advantage of them all. I can’t afford to at to listen, I listen to the ones available to listen to.,The remixes, the daily calm, are so great in this hectic world and unusual time in history. I’m not a person who has a lot of problems with stress but it’s such an oasis!,I would give this app 0 stars but I can’t 🙄 this whole thing is stupid anyways. I had gotten an ad about this app and I have trouble sleeping and also have anxiety so I thought this would be a good app for me but turns out ITS A COMPLETE SCAM you have to pay for everything and I’m broke so guess how that turned out. Just don’t get this it’s a waste of time.,Each day the Calm app is my first item on my daily routine because it Inspires me to meet the challenges of the day. Even though I am retired and relatively healthy, there are challenges.,Why am I being asked to sign in each time? I miss clicking, making notes without the hassle. Just saying.,Have purchase the Calm app 2yrs ago and absolutely love everything they have on this app. The music, meditation on emergency anxiety relief, and more.. yes I recommend you download Calm it’s worth the price you pay.,Amazing app I can use anywhere! It’s always with me and can be used at a moments notice.  I was hesitant about purchasing and now I don’t have any regrets doing so.,It’s ok it’s just everything you have to have premium or it has to be unlocked and it just like it very hard for me to find free stop because most of the are locked but overall it’s good and I like how you can change the narrator’s but yea it’s ok,I rly like the men narrated stories especially Stephen Lyons he has such a calming and soothing voice almost like a grandpa reading from childhood always puts me to sleep,I tried the Calm app over a year ago and love it so much that I continued my subscription.

There are many ways to use Calm and at my convenience.\\nI use this app every day!!!\\nThank you to all the wonderful beings at Calm for your contribution in making lives better! XO,Just listen to one of the story’s or a song after buying the subscription,Tamara Levite’s meditations are always truly useful to me. She doesn’t talk too much, and what she does say really helps a newbie understand the point and practice of meditation. This has helped me immensely.,I wanted to try something to help my sleep performance with a so called free app, but to use it I need to send email, phone number and or more things that stress me out, things I have to do during my job all day long, my opinion, if it\\'s free trial or what ever you say, make it free,(stress free), at least for the first time use!!!!!

I am sold!,Is Calm affiliated with Disney? If so, I’ll be cancelling my Calm app. Disney is engaging in activities to quell free speech and force employees to step in line with their philosophies. I see Disney music on your app and I enjoy it, but I enjoy American freedom more.,I’ve been having trouble sleeping and so has my child.  We put on sleep meditation and we both were out of it.,I have used the Calm app and daily meditation throughout the Pandemic. I am grateful for this resource. I have grown a great deal during this time. The app is easy to use and I enjoy the narration. Thanks Calm,I use this app every morning to start my day.

As this app has brought me peace.,I love this app it helps me fall asleep and I usually can’t fall asleep till 3 am or something but this app makes me fall asleep in an hour tops and that’s great for me (I know I sound like an ad),I signed up to learn how to meditate, but I actually found it helpful in dealing with the anxiety I experience from time to time. I am very great full I signed up.,I was a beginner with meditation and mindfulness and this app helped my depression and anxiety diminish. I listen to the white noise to help my sleep issues and it helps greatly. Bottom line this app is worth it.,I have had many apps that allow help but this app won’t allow you to listen to anything without spending a single dollar. I’m all about contributing but this app is not worth the download because every single thing will cost you. Better off just going on imusic and just listening to soothing sounds. It’s FREE. If I could give 0 stars I would.,Calm has helped me become more aware of life. I feel more awake and present. Convenient to listen to it while going for a walk or driving.,This app is overall pretty decent. Soundscapes are relaxing. Stories are great for relaxing. BUT and this is huge. I just can’t take Tamara’s voice.  It’s unfortunate and maybe just a personal problem for me but I wish you could choose another voice. So while the app has benefits and nice features, this is a big problem for me,I started this this morning and it was a very interesting way of meditation. I will continue to do it more often. I truly enjoyed this meditation.,Love the app but it is obvious that they want you to pay. Understandable but the daily calms are free on my Apple Watch but not my phone? It doesn’t make sense.

I’ve recently tried other apps and nothing compares.,Calm provides me with diverse stories from around the globe to soften all “busy” thoughts and gets me to sleep well ahead of the end of the stories.

And I was like I need to have this app. This app is so good in so many different ways!!😍,The Sleep Stories are good but male voices are easier to listen to. Many of the stories are very long, around 40 min. I prefer the shorter ones, around 20 minutes but very few of those.\\n\\nI don’t use any of the meditation or music.,I enjoy the various soundscapes to sleep to. Unfortunately, when the track loops, sound cuts out with a hard stop-restart which can jolt me out of my very light sleeping. This isn’t a problem when using my Apple home pod’s built in soundscapes, which are more limited but perfectly executed.,The Calm app has changed my life. The practical and gentle teachings have strengthened my meditation practice more than I could have ever imagined. It’s my little pocket of peace each day.

Add pain please. I’m not stressed or bored or angry but I sure am in pain.,A lovely, enticing description of this app leads people to believe that by using the “free download “at least some useful items will be available for free. However, instead of relaxing me, this app has stressed me out more because it’s typical of the kind of deceit that is rampant. There is a hefty price tag, And essentially nothing is available on this “free app”.,Scenes are not selectable. I could scroll through them but most of the time I can’t select anything. Had to scroll left to right and if i’m lucky i could select one of the many. This is stressing me out so much!,Whatever was happening with the app, is no longer happening.\\nThank you.,Now you have to pay for everything.

Looking forward to doing more sessions!,Not sure how many of us need to write reviews saying that the app hasn\\'t worked for the past TWO updates, but consider me a voice in the choir.

There are so many free mediation apps that have the same features and where you aren’t paying for TV commercials.,Calm is so relaxing well the things in it are I love that every thing in the app is like a soft voice well that’s all I have no complaints,I have struggled with ptsd and anxiety for most of my life. Soothing sounds have helped me get me to a great defense for staving away past life experience and brought my life into a calmer state,where do i begin? functionalists are terrible. choices are limited. you have to listen to a whole series from the beginning and can’t customize a playlist. the de stressing meditation spends a long time telling you how bad stress is to your body. duh! i don’t need to listen to you to add to my stress! calm spent big bucks on celebrity narration. if you think anything is better just because a celebrity is involved, then by all means, download this a app with poor content. if you want an app that use your money on content and functionality, pass this up!,This app is the greatest I have ever used. My friends were harassing me and now I feel so calm and gentle. Thank you so much for making this app!,I love the stories but the app isn’t great. Stopped working on my iPad months ago and now it no longer works on my iPhone. Just is stuck on “Take a deep breath”. Can’t use it and I paid for a subscription.,I have seen so much improvement with my mental health with this app but its a bit laggy and crashes a lot.,This is wonderful after the last four years of turmoil! Right for the new attitude! Thank you so much!,I used to have the app and most of the stuff I had access to I don’t anymore. It’s almost not worth it. With COVID financial struggles I’m not going to pay for it if the choice is getting gas for my car or medication refills.,Basically no free content. Hard to tell if the app would work well for me without getting a fair sampling of what to offer. I prefer the app MyLife. Lots of free content and an option to upgrade. I hardly ever buy apps, but I’ll likely buy MyLife based on everything I’ve been able to sample.,It’s unfortunate they roll you from trial into an expensive $70 1-year plan. Shady, especially in this economic time, and caused me to cancel.  Provide monthly value to your customers and you won’t need churn-reduction techniques like this. You got a cancel out of me as a result and a “never again”.,Great app for beginners new to meditation, but for those of us who have been meditating for years it is sorely lacking in variety. I would love to have more variety!! Such as lucid dreaming meditations, & meditations geared toward opening your third eye, or increasing your intuition.,I love the podcasts there and stories. It gets me inspired and motivated in the mornings and the meditation is very helpful. However, I’d recommend Calm to have a wider selection of voices for meditation,I got this app just so I could listen to Harry Styles bed time story it is amazing and I fall asleep super quick beat thing he has ever done,Haven’t used the app for a long time, but a few years ago it was instrumental in helping me get my stress and blood pressure under control. Now everything’s hidden behind a paywall and the free features are pretty useless. Guess it’s time to delete - what a shame.,IMHO there is a significant difference between “offers in-app purchases” and bait & switch.   This app is the latter.  Pretends to be free, asks you a bunch of questions and takes your personal info AND THEN reveals you have to pay to proceed.  You’ve already made a payment providing your personal marketable info, but too bad so sad you get nothing for that.  AVOID,There are so many great features to this app. My entire family uses it regularly.,For the price, and the amount of success this company has had, you’d think they would have an app that consistently works. Literally, every time I open it, it has some bug. I have deleted it and re-downloaded it so many times, I am simply sick of using it. I prefer Headspace at this point.,Meditation always seemed an unattainable feat, but a small dedication of time can change so much.,I use this app every night and so does my daughter! This is the best variety of sleep stories and lullabies I’ve ever come across. Thank you Calm!,This helped me go to sleep many times plz consider purchasing,If you are willing to pay $70 for a app you keep paying for every year, you’re an idiot!!!  There’s nothing on this app that is worth paying every year. I would have paid it once. But not every year. Stupid is as stupid does!!!\\nThere are so many free meditations out there that are so much better.,I love the diversity of options available to relax as each day is different for me for what helps my anxiety best. Love love love the sleep stories and soundscapes the best. And the Moby tracks.,Please fix this as the previous two updates have made the app freeze on the “take a deep breath screen” then force closes after a few more seconds. I heavily rely on this app to help reduce my anxiety and stress and it’s been very hard to manage lately without having the programs you offer readily available.,This app is truly amazing. It got me through some of my darks days & helped me find light in my life again.,I’d like to see more updates on stories especially with female voice,You guys should make the app so that you could do a FEW activities to unlock a FEW videos,I love the app but you have to pay for pretty much evert thing. So crazy and unfair. I am in middle school and I can’t sleep. So i wanted to meditate and i found this app but I can’t pay for it. I don’t have the money. Please change this 😞 🙃,That really works when I start having an anxiety attack. I wish it’d show my heart rate throughout that session,The app is wonderful, except that so many of the meditations are led by Tamara Levitt. I think she may own the company or something, but her intonation is awful. Pretentious, icky. It’s something she does on purpose- if she tones it down I’d like the app a lot more. For now I just avoid all meditations that she narrates.,I enjoy this app so much if u are feeling angry, sad, stressed, and all of those emotions them calm is the app for u. I highly suggest that u download this app it is amazing.,Consistently have problems with login and app functions. I have had to set up a new home structure on multiple occasions. A change to my Google account password wipes out home structure.,I find the meditations so rewarding. Learning to meditate has significantly improved my depression and social anxiety, after a most challenging year!,This is a great app, every time I get a chance to do calm, I fall asleep. I have the subscription, but it is still good without it! Go download calm now!! ☺️❤️,You will not let me cancel I accidentally hit the button\\nKnow you are charging my account \\nI have no where to cancel \\nI do not like this at all,I did not like this app I downloaded this to help me fall asleep faster but the sounds were glitching and it told me I had to pay for sounds. Overall this app is bad and I would not download it because if you pay money it is still bad audio.,My doctor recommended Calm to me. It has been terrific way for me to pause, reset and move forward.,The 60$ fee is so worth it! I am 12 and I have anxiety and this helps me so much! The meditations are fantastic! Every night I listen to a sleep story. I love the wizard of Oz!,Doing 30 day challenge. It’s 10 minutes and it helps daily. Simple as that. This is a good app for reducing anxiety.,Hello I’m not a teen yet so I don’t get to sleep with my phone but calm helps me every day. When I say ever say I meditate in the morning and night.

This app has been great. So many features but I mostly do the daily calm with Tamara Levitt. She’s awesome!! Also really like Jeff Warren!,I’ve been putting it aside to try this app! So happy I did today. I am excited for my meditation journey!,I don’t understand why people who create apps that target their downloads for people with struggles make them pay for it? Like seriously if someone can’t afford help on a free app - then why make the app in the first place if people can’t even use it?,This app makes me feels so calm weather I am so in the mood sleep or just vibe with some rain or fire noises, it is an absolutely perfect app.,This app has changed my life! It has taught me so much. It is worth every penny for the yearly subscription.,I love it it relieves my stress and takes my mind off everything like a big pause button!!😊,I love this app wish you where able to have all of the podcasts and stuff 😕but still love this app 😆,Saw the TV as thought it was free or at least some features would be. It’s a 7day trial and then you have to pay for a subscription. There is no calm “lite” version either. Just wanted soft music really. Already have the purring cat. I’ll keep looking for something that’s not going to stress me out with fees.,The morning meditation for relieving stress is a fantastic way to start my day! I highly recommend giving it a try.,When you pay for an app, you expect it to work. The crashing issue that’s been going on since the last update is annoying. What’s the point in meditating when halfway through it crashes? I don’t plan on renewing my subscription.,Check if your healthcare provider offers the app for 1 year free! I will re-up after. Amazing and enjoyable resource.,The sleep stories really help me fall asleep. I have trouble sleeping, so i need all the tools I can get. The sleep stories really help me fall asleep calmly, and stay asleep.,There are to many stuff for premium and ITS 62:00 USD LIKE CMON IS MY dad supposed to pay almost 123 almost for both of us like cmon guys but otherwise it’s good it made me relax and sleep on day one of calm,It got rid of my anxiety pit the premium is really expensive just make the premium cheaper and this app I perfect,So I opened the app out of curiosity and half of the stuff on it you have to bye the subscription witch I find pretty stupid for an app that’s supposed to calm you and help you sleep and what not. So I tried the app it’s ok it didn’t change anything in my life. If anything caused me more frustration than it solved.,If you want to feel better, this app may help. Why not check it out?,In the commercial it shows a scene with background sound playing, however this is not possible in the app. That’s very disappointing, an app that can combine a moving scene with the soundscapes will easily overtake this app.,I tried this app out because i was having trouble sleeping this app is great i have had the best ever ever sleep totally recommend,I love the guided meditations for any situation. I also love the masterclasses, but I would like them to add more. I’ve listened to them all many times, and that’s lovely, but I think new masterclass material would be awesome.,One meditation track is free, everything else in the app music, soundscapes, sleep stories are all gated behind a $70 a year paywall with a short free trial. Maybe make one item per category available for free that way the user can subscribe after they sampled it without signing up for a trial.,Please make it so I can load more than one story at a time to continue playing. Thank you.,This app is just annoying. I saw it multiple times on ads and thought about trying it. Surprise surprise almost everything is behind a paywall. \\n\\nThis wouldn’t be an issue if they kept the premium a little more separate from the free version but it’s kinda obnoxious and in your face. \\n\\nNot only am I not interested in paying up to $69 annually for this but I’m also not interested in this app dangling stuff in front of me like a little child. This is supposed to calm people down not tick me off.\\n\\nDon’t spend money on this. And no I don’t want your free trial.,This is my second year of doing the Daily Calm, and I love it! Tamera does a great job finding meaning topics and quotes! Keep it going!,Very good app for someone who dose not want to pay for subscription.

Highly suggested cause calling a friend sometimes isn’t possible.,Thank you for sharing with us 🙏🏽😍🙌🏽,“Calm” has been my “go to” to get away and refocus.

Invest in this app. Buy it.,i love this app the sleep stories are top notch. however i wish you could play another story or pick a few to play kind of like a playlist, i’ve had to download another sleep app that has this capability but i love these stories so much more. it sometimes takes me a while to fall asleep andi hate having to turn on my bright phone to pick another story.,I love calm because every morning, I get to have my daily check ins and listen to music and meditation guides for the day,The daily insights into aspects of life have helped me make meditation a daily practice. This app has helped me on my journey to  joy, love and happiness on a daily basis.,I always thought meditation would be difficult or embarrassing or unhelpful. CALM has taught me how easy and transformative meditation can be.,okay in all honesty the app is great. i just think it would be better if i didn’t have to have the trial to use everything. i can only listen to one stores and i only downloaded the app for harry styles BUT THATS ON PREMIUM,This is terrible because I got this app to sleep easier but I need to pay to do that like why Why do I need to pay for premium to be able to sleep easier I need more rest but this app is scamming me to sleep easier.I need to get to get better grades in school but this is not letting me sleep better.,The app, which had some troubles loading, seems to have settled down,Really good and helpful app for those trying to build calm and positive lifestyle .would be better if more functions can be used in free version.,The content and “course” is great!  Deduction for lack of accessibility for the blind!! 😣. Some of it reads aloud but too many “button” references without describing what that button is for. The year is 2021. Cmon people!,This product works like a 24/7 psychological doctor for its user,I downloaded “CALM” to have relaxing noises so I can go to sleeps easier. This app kept playing adds during it all and wanted me to pay for everything. So to those people who read the reviews first, you can get it if you want but to me it’s not worth it. 😐,I have several favorite stories especially love train stories, thx,Apparently you have to opt out of the yearly subscription if you do the 7 day free trial. I was trying it for my mom who was in the hospital and was too stressed and missed my window. Come to find out I was charged not a nominal monthly fee but $70 dollars for the year subscription. Total Scam.,I lobe it but I just wish I didn’t have to pay for more stuff if I just want to relax and calm my self,I LOVE THIS APP. You can use it any time of day. It had meditating, sleep stories, and a bunch of other stuff to! I fall asleep as fast as you can say boom!,I was excited to use the app, I’ve heard good things about it. I downloaded it, loved the water noises in the background... but then I saw Lebron James. I do not support a man of such hateful views in society. He obviously isn’t very mindful so I could highly doubt he would have any advice for the rest of us. \\nOnce he’s removed from this app, I’ll gladly redownload.,The original few voices on calm were earnest and the stories were soothing. Now that it has become celeb based it has lost the magic of what made it great. Voice actors like Alan Sklar, Stephen Fry, Stephen Lyons and Tamara Levitt  are the way. Also, stick to the fiction classics. Hans Christian Anderson and Kenneth Grahame are classic for a reason, why are we trading in something timeless for something trendy?,You absolutely want to have the premium version to use this app. There is a tiny handful of free choices and it takes awhile to weed through to find them. The app Insight Timer was more generous to those of us who cannot afford to pay. I was not feeling calmer by having to dig.,I started using The Calm App when the Covid Quarantine period started last March. It truly helps to ground myself and refocus. Love it!,There are so many choices in this app for people to choose from.  My favorite are the daily calming ritual with Tamara.,Learning how to meditate has been really helpful for keeping myself calm and focused throughout my day,This app had so much potential but why is her voice on so many of the meditations?

Excited to continue using this app,I love my Calm app—I’ve learned to meditate which I never thought was possible. Music is great to fall asleep to at night.,I love the choices of music or meditation or whatever you might need at particular times.,The ads are different to what it shows. You can’t try to help someone and have them pay. What if there stressed out and broke. What if there little kids trying to get help. I honestly don’t think it’s worth to pay for. You should have a lot of more things for free.,I enjoy so much the sounds of nature, it teach you how to star you meditation If you don’t know how to star! \\nI recommend it,Tamara Levitt does most of the meditations, and her smarmy, unctuous tone and sing-song-y vocal fry is the most unnatural, put-on pretense I have ever heard from any human—and especially not a human in the business of guided meditation. I cannot listen to her at all. I had to cancel subscription and find someone with a much less affected accent.,Just finished day 1 of a 7 day meditation course on relieving anxiety.  Day 1 was amazing!  Can’t wait for the rest of the sessions!  Highly recommend John Armstrong.,I am loving the male voice of Jeff Warren & his daily trips are the best!! Thank you for adding this. I also love the sleeping mediation music, so many delicious options. Namaste ☮️,I like this app a lot. It helps me go to sleep, and relax. The one thing I wish was that their was music for free, and more pod casts, that were longer and more that were free. Love the app tho!,Great app with solid content. However, virtually every screen/section has vast majority locked behind paywall. For example, feeling anxious I tapped “emergency calm.” I then learned that for $60/yr I could use that feature. \\n\\nI’m confident I can achieve mindfulness without IAPs shoved down my throat.,I accidentally bought a year subscription, best accident I could ever have made, this app is helping me kick insomnia in the rear!!,After years of being a premium subscriber, and carefully favoriting my content throughout the app, the favorites section has completely disappeared for all sleep tracks, meditations, and music. This makes it essentially impossible for me to locate desired content efficiently.,I like it but why does about everything have to have premium? Little ridiculous i might say. Give us some nature sounds and some music that is free please. If it was like that i would rate 5/5,I think this is awesome app! It’s very calming and relaxing! Butttt it’s not that great if you don’t have the thingy where you pay for it like me. You basically have to pay for almost everything on this app. So if your not willing to pay then don’t download,$70 a year?? you kidding me. I had a harder time getting to sleep cause i had to put so much energy into simply finding a free story i can listen to. THERES 4, but yanno if you jus want to hear the sound of waterfalls then get the app. That is still nice ambience to slump\\nto.,Seen the commercial over and over... thought it would help out but just like any other app you have to pay for everything.

Waste of money because I can’t use,Got stuck with a 1 year sub for $80 and no hope of a refund. Thank,This app really helps a lot with mind and body as well as what was written in the title,This app has been helping me sleep for about 2 weeks now and then they took off the only free story I was reading and I can’t sleep now. It’s $70 a year which I can’t afford. I’m so disappointed and I’m afraid of what my OCD will do now that I can’t distract myself. I’m very upset.,I only wish that there was an option to have the Tibetan bowl sound in the background with the guided meditation vs the nature soundscapes.,I got calm premium, and I paid the $70 , and it still said that everything that you could only get with calm premium was locked.

The recoding of my sleep was a plus who knew a dream could make you talk.,Clear my thoughts and helpful with keep going one day at a time .,My question is why isn’t it free if it’s supposed to be calm and help you but you have to pay? Why? I would love to hear an explanation or please make it free and when you do I will redownload,Great app that had relaxing free sounds.

Very frustrating for those of us who pay money for the premium content.,- no way to build a queue so I can truly relax\\n- not enough <10 min videos\\n- I don’t like the female voice for sleep meditation.

They should not be on almost every single meditation.

Thank you for this great tool, highly recommended.,Calm is the best because it has been letting me go to sleep without getting a nightmare,This calm offers such useful mediation strategies for calming anxiety. My 8 year old and I mediate with the app together before bed!,I’ve never written a single app review before but this one has helped me so much that I thought it only right to share my experience. About a year and a half ago I started going to a therapist for depression, anxiety, and general mental health issues. In that very first meeting with her she told me to take a proactive approach and a good way to do that is to try this app. She recommended buying the premium version and I did and honestly that was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made regarding my mental health. Now, I’m not going to sit here and say that my mental health issues are gone or that this app was a miracle cure. In fact, that’s far from the truth but I will say I use this app every single day and they’re constantly updating the content on there so that there’s something for pretty much anyone. The user interface is incredibly easy to use and you can always find whatever you’re looking for and they have a ton of options so you can try whatever looks cool. Meditation doesn’t work for everyone and that’s important to keep in mind before investing. However, if you think this app will even help you a little bit and you have 10 minutes every day to spare then I promise you won’t regret it. \\nIf you’ve gotten this far into the review and you’ve liked what I’ve had to say so far then I might as well share my routine. I try to do the “daily calm” everyday which is always a 10 minute guided meditation and it’s different everyday. There are also so many short meditations to chose from and some of them can be for specific emotions or situations which can also be really helpful. Having an anxiety disorder (or really a disorder of any kind) makes it incredibly difficult to think in present time and focus on the present moment, but the meditations on here have made that less of an obstacle. The thing about meditation is that it grounds you while you’re doing it, but it also trains your brain to stay grounded in your daily life as well and that’s why it’s so often used to treat mental health issues and that’s why it works. \\nI also use the app when I go to bed because they have sleep stories, meditations for bedtime, music, and white noise sounds that will play until you tell the app to stop. The section on sleep is probably my favorite part of the app because getting a healthy amount of sleep used to be a huge issue of mine and now my sleep schedule has gotten so much better. Honestly if all of the other meditations didn’t exist I probably still would’ve bought the app solely because of how much it’s helped me sleep! That’s truly how awesome this section of the app is.\\nIn conclusion, what are you waiting for? Get this app!,It has become a staple in my nighttime routine. I sleep like a baby every night.,The sleep stories and meditation are absolutely amazing ! They help soo much with nightmares due to ptsd ! highly recommend for anyone,I’ve used this app for probably 4 years now but the past 35 or so meditation sessions I’ve done the app has crashed EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Manipulative marketing, fastest I’ve ever deleted an app. I’m not going to spend $70 on an app whether there be ~7 day free trial~ or not. Don’t waste your time.

Times are tough right now . Don’t like that if I want to use this app I have to upgrade and spend $ that I can’t do right now. When your not working cause of Covid-19 every penny counts. Too bad!!,It helps me fall asleep and forget get about stuff,I deleted the app for some space and I had a trial on there and now I\\'m trying to re-download it and it keeps on asking me to manage payments but the card that I use is off already,I’ve tried going through the settings to subscriptions with no ability to unsubscribe! Only a way to continue charging you! WTH! Developers, give people the ability to unsubscribe.,Recent upgrade to app has been buggy. You are greeted with an error - that states that internet connection not found. Turned app off and turned phone off and on does not help. Please fix.,I have used it for a week and it helps a lot.,I want to try it out before I buy so not the beat initial experience so far,Why must you have to pay for everything nowadays we can’t even be relaxed without paying money I personally don\\'t have the money for that I have to spend it on other things,Everyone should have this app.  Very soothing.,A perfect way to set your intentions for the day.,It’s pretty good but I do wish that you could listen and do more things without having to buy them,Typically my favorite app...but we’ve got to get these updates under control.

It won’t even open. 😣,This app helps me sleep every single night \\n\\nYou must try this app👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,I absolutely LOVE this app, but to me there’s a slight issue. I wanted to get the premium, but IT IS WAY TOO MUCH MONEY. I just think that it’s unreasonable. Please lower this!😣,I just love it!😻everyone needs this to survive like literally it helps me not freak,The app itself is great but the free version is so limited that they might as well not advertise it at all. I have enjoyed the couple features that are available though.,You make a “Free” account so you can stare at their cover art? All I want is a little assistance so I can cope with the struggles of daily life and be a contributing member of society yet the one app that might seem useful would rather charge an outrageous upfront price. This is just a cash grab.,Absolutely nothing is unlocked without subscribing and paying $$$ so you can’t even evaluate it without the 7 day “free” trial, after which they hope u forget to unsubscribe and they charge you,Downloaded the app in hopes of having something to help me become more mindful and “ calm”. Literally only one story was free, nothing else could be utilized unless I paid to upgrade. Just feels like an in-genuine app designed to profit off people. No thanks,It is great and for example at 10:26 I was eating a cool watermelon juicy and yummy then calm came and it was great I honestly love it 😊 try it 😉,Basically everything is locked so there really isn’t anything free about it. \\nYou have to upgrade to the Premium version to be able to do anything.,Cool concept ad made me super interesting until once you download it everything is locked and they want you to pay 80 a year to use it only thing you’re “welcome to use” are som base background noises at the home tab😭,I get really anxious sometimes so I open this app and calm down,The ad is so convincing that it helps everybody sleep but really you gotta pay to sleep.

This app is the only app in my phone that I genuinely appreciate!,I love Calm.  It helps me get to sleep most nights.  However the latest update opens to the take a deep breath landing page and then crashes.  So, I can’t use any of the features right now.,It’s helps me sleep a lot more better and I love the sleep stories and the actors,I won’t make this too dramatic. I live a good life and am generally a happy person, and still I always felt like I was carrying so much stress (and honestly for no reason better than anyone else). Despite my attempts to lower stress through exercise, a healthy diet, and time outdoors, I always found those techniques to be short-term solutions (I still do all the above in tandem with Calm by the way). I finally tried Calm after hearing and reading such positive reviews. Calm has not only met but exceeded my expectations. It definitely takes a personal commitment, but carving out even just 10 minutes for the Daily Calm has completely altered my mindset in just a few weeks. In few instances do I now use the word “stressful” to describe my day. Taking stock of my daily feelings and thoughts through a quick 1-minute reflection is enough for me to get in touch with what I’m most anxious about or grateful for. And then the meditations themselves are enjoyable, plentiful and highly effective! The quality is exceptional as well. I absolutely love the narrators, the categories (including bedtime stories, soundscapes, music, and traditional meditations), and the overall peace of mind that comes with this wonderful program. $70/year is so worth the price! Of course Calm is just the tool. You’re the one who will have to come to the table with an open mind and a ready heart willing to do the work, but doing so will yield tremendous value! The world will be a better place if everyone took 10 minutes for the Daily Calm. Thank you to this wonderful team for changing my life in such a small bit meaningful way every day!,It always makes me fall asleep. I love it. Do you?,How are you charging this much money and still scraping all of this data from users? Other meditation apps are cheaper and don’t collect any data at all.

Wait they want less stressed, and more calm people in this world for a moderate fee! 🤔,Just started but like it so far,My way to start the day.,Unlock everything,This app helps me so much to feel better,There is very little that you listen to if you do not subscribed to premium.

I appreciate the option of voice talent in Headspace as well.,It’s a good app but why say it’s free if you literally can’t do anything without a subscription?,the guided meditations are wonderful, and it’s aesthetically enjoyable, with great features. what seems to be lacking the hardest, however, is diversity. it’s regular contributors are starkly white, and the few people of color seem to be back shelved, or just stock images. this is disheartening, esp with mindfulness’ origins in east asia. i’m eager to find somewhere with more wealth of different voices and people once my subscription expires.,This app is too expensive  at $70.  I tried to get a refund and feel like I’m going circles.  I canceled my subscription just not worth the money. Especially if you are not currently working.

There are so many amazing things about it, but here is a summarization:\\nBefore I got this app, I seriously had sleeping problems. Like, it would take me and hour to fall asleep! So, I got this app, and it seriously helps me out with stuff, like I started listening to some of the sleep stories on here, and I fall asleep before the story ends every. Single. Time!!! There’s even a “back to sleep” thing that helps you fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night randomly. (Which I find myself doing quite often)\\nSecondly, I also have some major anger problems. Like, I will scream over the littlest things. Sometimes, doing the breathing exercises in the app really helps me out with that and doing some of the meditation stuff on here helps with that as well. Also, I have the subscription on this app, which is TOTALLY worth it. It gives you access to more things I’m pretty sure, and it’s not way too much to handle. But then of course, I don’t know what the app is like without the subscription so if you don’t get the subscription I don’t know what to promise you. All I know is that with the subscription you get access to all of the different meditations, sleep stories, breathing exercises, etc... for 0$, as in completely free. So if you get the subscription, there’s that. \\nAlso, this isn’t one of those apps where it makes you rate the app right as you get it. Seriously, all these 5 star ratings are because it actually works. Also, if you are trying to go to sleep on this app at night, I recommend putting your phone on night mode and turning the darkness all the way down. (Because screens affect your sleep)\\nOverall, I highly highly recommend this app, and really hope that you end up getting it. ( especially if you are trying to solve sleep problems or just needing to relax ) \\nBy the way, this is NOT a manager or employee or something for the calm app. This is a middle schooler who just seriously loves the app. Bye!,Oh it’s a freeeee app ok let’s get it.

Nope, you don’t automatically get charged for a $15 monthly plan, you get charged for the whole year if you fail to cancel your free trial. Lovely! But whatever, my fault. At least I can “cancel anytime!”\\n\\nOk, well here’s my rant on the “cancel anytime policy.” Sorry to say, but canceling anytime is a little play on words. Sure, you can indeed “cancel anytime” like the app says. However, it’s useless. Canceling 364 days before the subscription ends, like I was in the process of doing, and canceling 1 day before the subscription ends, results in the same charge. Yep, you’re still getting charged the $70 for the year even if you cancel, like in my case, 18 hours into the year’s subscription. \\n\\nSo what should you take from this? Just cancel your 7 day trial after 5 days or you’ll be charged. And if you still want to use the app after the trial, I would STILL recommend canceling and then buying the monthly plan, at least to start. Because if after 1-2 months you no longer like the app, you’re stuck with paying $70. If you still like the app after a couple months, then upgrade to the yearly plan, which is cheaper then paying for 12 individual months. (You do this in Apple’s settings > tap your name at the very top > tap subscriptions > tap the “calm” app. \\n\\nOk class, there’s my lesson for the day. :),They charge you without notice. Wont refund money. No help. This company is predatory and unethical.,Very nice app,you have to pay for everything.,There is no universal sleep aid; sure finding this is not mine.,There’s only ONE story for free on this app and the rest I have to buy. 70$ a year SEVENTY DOLLARS ARE U KIDDING ME. FOR A STORY TO BE READ TO ME I HAVE TO PAY SEVENTY DOLLARS. I’m deleting this app straight away,i wish that there was more stuff of calm that was free,It was wonderful,A good start,way too expensive and overheated my phone in less than a minute,I love Tabitha Brown’s contributions,All I get is a blue screen that\\nSays take\\nA\\nDeep\\nBreath,Great!!! Loved it! Good for blood pressure,It’s a free app but all the content pretty much costs $60-$70.,I just saw a TV commercial for Calm using LeBron James… So I instantly deleted my app. 👎🏻,Thanks for nothing,Great 1st day,…for giving away your money. #ripoff,I love it,Nothing is free. Disappointed and deleting.,Let me start off by saying, I would give 5 stars and be completely over the moon ecstatic if it had IN APP VOLUME CONTROL. I purchased an annual subscription almost a month ago, and I have been using it daily. It’s very helpful in explaining how to mediate, guiding and teaching and the reasoning why it is so important. I mainly purchased it because I have daily struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep. I really do wish there was an option with volume control, this is a major issue for me! I have to turn the volume on my phone down, and if/ when I do fall asleep, I don’t wake up to my alarm or calls. \\n\\nCalm WOULD BE PERFECT and 100% better if there was the ability to change the volume of the voice on meditations and background sounds on the app alone, not having to change my entire phone volume! I have another sleep app that is free (with option to upgrade) with sounds to fall asleep to and it has ✅a mixer, allowing me to not disrupt my phone volume, just controls the volume directly on the app. ✅ I feel that there is no reason Calm should not have something like that. If I keep the volume at where my iPhone is already set to, it is extremely loud, to the point I can hear meditations or sleep sounds through earplugs! Because I mainly use this for sleep, this has been a HUGE ISSUE and I BEG THE DEVELOPERS TO IMPROVE THIS AND INCORPORATE an IN APP VOLUME CONTROL!!! Other than the volume issue, I really do enjoy Calm, but I do wish I would have done the free trial before purchasing an annual subscription. I don’t think I would have purchased, especially not an annual subscription, in retrospect. I definitely won’t renew if they don’t incorporate in app volume control.\\n\\nLove it, it just NEEDS IN-APP VOLUME CONTROL!\\nTo the developers, please please please do this!,this app is all about the money. i couldn’t find one meditation that didn’t need premium,Calmest app ever 😌,Nothing free , which is fine but be mindful ofthe same.,Love this app!,There is no trial available,Wont stop asking me to review it,My calm is not working.,Will never use an app that has the great divider Lebron James involved,Kaiser plan is the besttoo,Awesome relaxing review.,Love this app!,This is terrible,Story mediatashis osum,Very chill ,especially Erik Braa,Why make the app free if nothing in the app is free, dumb.,No free content,The app is amazing,Hi I love  the Beauty and the beast story.,It is so claming and realxing,Peaceful exercise,Hate it!\\nTrying to cancel,It’s calms me.,It’s not free but it helps.,Like it... god bless...,Cancel subscription please.,i got this app just to listen to the harry styles one but it cost money😐😐😐,App won’t open,Please leave political opinions out of the meditations.,it’s supposed to reduce stress until you see the fee after the 7 day trial,Great,70 DOLLARS A YEAR! what a scam.

So to be able to get anything from this app you have to pay for it, $69.99 a year. During these trying times it hard to afford a roof over my head and I have a lot of stress and suffer from insomnia. It would have been nice if a few things were open to use on this app. I saw only one story that was open… that’s it! Ridiculous! I’m sure it helps people but what about ones who really can’t afford that $70 a year right now huh? You should have free stuff on there for people like me. Will be deleting this app and looking for a free one. I’m upset cause this looked like a good app that might have helped me in many areas but I guess money is more important than actually helping people. :(,Restless,okay so, i used to have this app and it gave me some sounds for free and i completely worked with that, got a new it was deleted for someone reason just re-downloaded it and just deleted it because just about everything is locked in less you pay for it, there’s apps that you can listen to stuff for free but if you can’t find any there’s always youtube, just deal with the ads, it’s free and it works sooo yeah i wouldn’t download this app, hope this helps someone😘,Yes there is a free trial, but you have to jump through hoops to unsubscribe and if you can’t unsubscribe they automatically charge you $69.99/year with no other options just because you downloaded the app and created an account. They don’t even tell you about the charges until after you create your account. I’m more stressed now than before I downloaded calm.,Charged me $69.99 for an app I have never used. Don’t put credit cards in your apple wallet. Ridiculous,Just downloaded for the ambient sounds one day and a week later they charged me 69.99 for a year subscription automatically. What company would even do that and feel like they care about the consumer? I get that I forgot I downloaded your convoluted app but why jump to a year charge versus maybe weekly or monthly. Feels like s scam and money grab. I canceled my subscription right away and now fighting the charges with Apple. For an app that promotes mental health it’s completely the opposite. Ridiculous and will get refunded.,I am unable to cancel this app and locked into a year of payment. I’ve used multiple features and nothing felt like a fit for me compared to meditation sessions I’ve attended in person. People rave about the bedtime stories so I tried that instead, but still prefer reading books. It wasn’t clear to me that I wouldn’t be able to get out of the year payment, which is especially disappointing since the promo code I had didn’t work initially. I know this company is doing very well and has grown immensely, so I was hoping by now they would allow their customers flexibility in cancelling.,I use this app everyday.Thanks for creating this app and for the wonderful people who contribute to it.,i wish i could give this zero stars, seriously, 69.99 a year? for some sounds you can get off youtube and your itunes library? there are creators on youtube that do this FOR FREE. huge waste of money, extremely over priced.,They have been saying forever that they will have these two options at some point but still don’t. And they provide no status updates either. Why can’t so many other product connect to Alexa and Roku but they can’t.,The app sounds great and has a great hook, but when you download and try to make an account, they sign you up for a free trial and hit you with the annual fee of $69.95. The app will literally cost you $70 before you even get to try it.,I’m very confused why it’s so expensive. Everything I tried to do was locked, sooo whats the point of this app.  I think I’d rather not sleep good then pay $79.99 on this app.,This app only works if you buy it \\nFor example if you want it to tell you a story during bedtime you would have to buy it!!!!!!!!!!!   \\nEvery thing you want it to do to you to be relaxed you need to buy it!!!!!!!!\\nSome of the stuff you need to buy cost 69.99!!!!!!!!\\nOr 99.99\\n              This is the worst app ever.!!!!!!!  If you by this app you may have to buy everything then later you will have know money, and ignore other stores about liking this app 😒🥺\\n\\n    I hate this app\\n\\n   It is the dumbest app ever  \\n\\nBut........\\nAt least you can listen to different types of sounds like my favorite is listening to a fire it calms me.

Lately I’ve been experiencing anxiety that has kept my mind racing with thoughts and I’ve not been able to sleep. After the first meditation course I am already calming down and learning my mind and body. I would highly recommend this app if you are having panic attacks.,Soddy you have we deß therapist says I need to learn to relieve my e CD XX treme tension.

Can’t open the app to cancel free subscription. Was just charged $34.99 although I have never been able to use this and didn’t authorize a renewal. Can’t find any way to contact customer service.,Until now we were able to do a breathing exercise for more than 30 minutes. But they have removed the main function for free users on this app. @pple has taken down my review, so you have to put the app for 5 star or it wouldn’t count. \\n\\nPeople need to mediate during the pandemic but this company seeks to take advantage of the misery.,I want to renew w clam but it will not let me can someone e call me please I miss it 609 883/6427,I used to use this app awhile back. I remember having some free options to the soundscapes which I loved. I hadn’t used this app in awhile until a few days ago. Now nothing is free. \\n\\nYeah it’s a great app if you pay. $14.99 a month to get calm but yet you don’t have the money to get calm- hence needing the app. \\n\\nI suggest allowing features to be be purchased individually at a lower cost if purchased just for that specific feature. (Example: soundscapes $2.99 a month) Boom more customers!,You can download for free, but there isn’t much you can do after that without paying for it. I’ve paid for 3 years and can’t this year. There was a lot more available when I first downloaded it. Seems like they’ve stripped a lot of the free away.\\nIf you can pay, however, it’s a great app. I’m struggling to make ends meet and this is something I had to skip out.,Over all this app is ok, I love the app in general what it is is awesome but there should really be more available for people that don’t want to pay $69.99 a year,  I kept getting my hopes up because I would find somthing that is free and it would be a playlist that only the introduction is free. I wish that I could do more but I can only find about 3-5 things that are free. Again the idea of the app is awesome I feel like if you made more available there would be more users, might delet soon.,This app is falsely advertised as free. Received several ads for it in other apps, youtube, etc. all ads claimed that it was free. It is not. \\n\\nDecided to pay for it anyway. The supposed ‘clinically proven’ sleep meditation is not proven at all, and doesn’t work. \\n\\nDon’t waste your time and effort, you’re better off just using YouTube.,Ok, so I read the top review and got the app, thinking that there would be some locked things, but also a good amount of ink locked things. \\n\\nI was wrong. \\n\\nWhen I went to the music section, I could not find ANY music available free without having to pay. I scrolled through everything (in the music section) and could find nothing. NOTHING! \\nI know, I know. You’re probably wondering: Why don’t you just listen to something else on the app? \\nWell, the problem with that is that, me being an avid reader and a writer, the stories make my mind race as I think of plot twists and background stories *sigh*. I can’t do meditations either because they just don’t work for me. And I don’t like soundscapes because they get annoying to me. \\n\\nAll in all, the app has great content for people willing to pay around $70.00 a year. Anyone else trying to listen to sleep music? Just go to YouTube or Spotify because I don’t think this app is worth it.,Saw good reviews. Really disappointed. You can look up better sleep meditations on YouTube for free rather than paying an unreasonable amount to actually get access to anything worthwhile on this app. Literally found three things you didn’t have to get premium to listen to and they weren’t worth downloading a whole app just to listen to.,I canceled my 7 day free trial a day or two before the deadline and still you charged me not only once but TWICE for $69.99. Don’t use the supposed free trial!!!!!,I used the “free Calm app” two times. There were plenty of choices at that time. A few weeks later, I went back on and there were hardly any choices. I kept being promoted to sign up for the premium version. I used my Spotify account and found many of the same resources (soundscapes, meditation practices, etc.) \\nNot worth it for me.,Everything cost a lot! I can’t afford the high cost for calm! If you would be reasonable then maybe! The cost is over 50.00 yearly! I think the most I can afford is 30$! You are asking too much I feel!,When an app says free I expect to be able to use it without spending money, but noooo, it’s a free 7 day trial and the 70$ after no thank you I’ll stick with YouTube nature sounds👍👍,80$ per year for low quality free stock images and music mixed together, seriously?? There are tons of such content on YouTube for free. I was convinced by Instagram ad shows stunning relaxing videos but that was only ad and you will never find such content inside of app. Don’t waste your time.,Yep, if you don’t pay, you don’t play.,You literally have to pay to use the app. To listen to a story you have to pay $69.99 a year to have full access. I’m pretty sure they don’t give you a couple free stories. This app is not worth downloading and they give you a free trial but you have to pay $69.99 after the trial. Don’t recommend downloading this app. Horrible experience.,it\\'s monetizing my anxiety, i just wanted to relax. 70 dollars is an absurd amount for worse content than you can find on youtube,The whole app is a pay to use. Which it’s very nice and does help if you try and believe that it will help you. BUT ITS 80$ A YEAR. Wow what a absolute rip off. I’m a options trader making several million dollars a year and even I couldn’t imagine buying this. Really shows what kind of company this is with their prices and target audience. How would you expect a lower class citizen to be able to pay that amount to experience this app. If you cut the price in half you would have increased volume of users and your target audience would broaden so much you would net even more income then you already are. It amazes me the lack of intelligent people companies employ. I would give more stars because the app actually helps and it is amazing but I will not give any because of the lack of consideration, intelligence, and nobility. Also the disregard and no regard for people that are not as fortunate as others. A lot of people cannot experience this app because of the price. Don’t be a greedy company. There is far to many of them and the ones that are get exposed on social media and then lose massive profits due to conscious users that can weigh cost to usefulness and will only stand by a good and humble company. If my comment gets removed I will make sure to do a review and let my YouTube subscribers know that this app is overpriced and tell them to find another app. I have a lot of them.,Oh lord,They have really good sleep stories for adults which kids could also listen too.The kids sleep stories are a big hit or a big miss. They have a all around good app but the pop music that got transformed to sleep is another great way to sleep if it works for you.,Why is 80% of the app only for people who have subscribed? 69.99 a YEAR?? Too much money. Don’t get it.,CALM app, is a must for everyone! Kids, teens, men, women, it’s for all! \\n\\nQuick summary, early on in my marriage, I learned of my anxiety, after our first born I learned of my depression. Either of those alone aren’t easy to manage, then add the info below... Who wouldn’t need CALM in their life?\\n\\nI am a mother to 7 children and wife. I never imagined having this many children, nor would I have guessed our “fifth” pregnancy would turn out to be spontaneous triplets. \\n \\nThe amount of changes in our life in such a small window of time, sent my struggle with Anxiety and Depression into a fast spiral of mental breakdown. After seeking professional help, my husband knew a bit of CALM at home, on the go and walking was needed for this mama! He decided (upon my request) this app was worth the investment and gifted it to me. Let me say... Seven children (triplets) on a small salary. \\n\\nI have really enjoyed the CALM app, it’s helped me in so many areas of my life. \\n-My favorite part is the NEW content all.the.time! My other favorite is the meditation for beginners and pros. I have enjoyed learning how to meditate. The way husband describes it is, it’s teaching me how to go into my nothing box - like men. (YouTube: men and their nothing box.) Yes, yes, yes it does! I LOVE IT! Have you ever just wanted to silence the world or sit quietly in a crowded room and people watch!? Having no worry or care in the world about what is going on around you!? This app is so good at guiding you through your thoughts and feelings or allowing you the freedom to hear the wind in the trees, ocean sounds at sea, the crackling of fire and more. It’s amazing being taught how to slow down, love my inner self and sit listen to my own breathing. I definitely feel this app is for EVERYONE, especially for those struggling with mental and emotional thoughts. \\n\\nThis app is pricey, but having had the app since 2018ish - till now; we have been sent many coupons from the creator to continue it - at great discounted rates. It no doubt saved us a lot of money in the long run by simply signing up once and paying the amount requested (they hook you up!). \\n\\nMy only complaint is listening to female narrators. It’s so so so so so not my favorite! We need men narrators as a second option - more often! I’m not sure why or how, but the men narrators provide me more relief than the women. I definitely prefer listening to the calming voice of men in this CALM app. Hope this helps! 💜,On 05/06/2021, every single content is locked, there is not even 1 thing that is free. But looking at the app so far, it seems like a very \"mainstream\" app with lots of celebrity artists, maybe that explains why it\\'s so expensive. I\\'m confused how you could relax while listening to pop music, where\\'s the relaxing new age music? I used this app a long time ago and I remembered it had tons of free content like relaxing piano and ambient music and different relaxing scenes. I guess it changed for the worse, this is an app for mainstream Hollywood people.,This is a piece of useless app . \\nI want my money back ! \\nI can get better sleeping guide  videos on YouTube for free!!!! \\nThe stories are a joke ! \\nI WANT MY MONEY BACK!,The best one ever plz 10000000000 more plzzzzzzz,Idk where subscribers are getting the ‘free’ content. To access anything more than the intro, you need to purchase premium. The intro’s are the only thing included and then everything after the intro is premium. Don’t waste your time when YouTube has better calming/meditation/motivation content anyways.,Its nice as background noise but besides that its useless.  Unless you want to pay the $67.99 a year then its just white noise.  If you thought that your were going to learn about calming your mental state for free look elsewhere.,So I see this as an advertisement in YouTube I had a bad day the other day decided to get the app to help with sleep and what else it offers... I got the app and home to find out they literally are all locked every single session is locked and they want $70 per year to upgrade a premium . Super dumb to not have free sessions for people thing paying for meditation is not worth that much.,It is so timely a reminder to remember all the good things in life that exist and how meditation can be brought into every day life experience.Thank you.,Now you might be thinking that I’m just a hater or something but this app is not worth downloading, literally everything is locked and you have to pay 60 dollars a year just to listen to stories. Honestly not worth it,These just soft spoken talks and bedtime stories. This is not meditation nor does it teach you how to meditation. There are a lot better apps for actual meditation or just use YouTube.,Looks like I’ll be resorting to YouTube,This app is giving me EVEN more anxiety I have been looking for free things to listen to and they are ALL locked and I I DONT WANT TO PAY 69.00 dollars there are only TWO free update that,Really love this app, especially getting great use out of the sleep stories. So far my one request is that you please please make it available to play through Amazon Alexa,Decent app, good content. I did not renew after 1 year subscription. Currently I am listening to content on Spotify for sleep. If Calm added the ability to make playlists and/or queue content so stories could play through the night I’d be likely to come back.,So I got this app and for a few days I used the rain sound to sleep but to get the good stuff to help sleep and relax like the stories you have to pay like $30.00 and that IS NOT worth it so instant delete.When I still had the app it made me stressed because I didn’t think it was helping me and that much stress on a 11 year old  can’t be healthy.I saw other reviews saying similar problems so I think more stuff should be free.\\n\\nThank you for considering my ideas.,In past two months I have had problems with the app not loading content.It is very frustrating because I wake several times during the night and I like to use the app to listen to a new sleep story to get me back to sleep. I have been using me up for almost 3 years, paying the full subscription price. this is very annoying. \\n\\nthe content doesn’t load  I close the app. I restart my phone and nothing it still happens. It’s not my phone because other apps open and load without a problem. This problem seems to happen every other night practically.And it happens with all of the content on the site weather is asleep story, a meditation or music. \\n\\nIf this continues to happen I will definitely not renew when my subscription is over in a few months. Please fix this problem it is very annoying when you rely on a product and it doesn’t function properly.,Everything is about money. LOTS of money.\\nI have no problem compensating a developer for creating an app. I don’t. But I would rather pay $5-$10 up front as was once the app way of doing business. No longer. The more popular the app, the more the money factor kicks in. Now, the app is “free” - free to download and free to access a few token features. “Calm” was a nice idea. Now it’s big business. And I mean BIG. Yeah, they have a “free” version but the vast majority of content will set you back $69.99 a year! They have celebrity narrators and of course THEY do nothing free. “Calm” is a big, growing company in costly San Francisco. Their mission statement says they “want to make the world a happier place.” That’s lovely. So do I. In my opinion, big companies like all of the digital companies in the Bay Area of California, don’t make the world a “happier place.”\\nIt’s the little guys - the kitchen table creators that accomplish that. But once they get too popular, the lure of big money does them in every time. I will not pay $70 for a year sub or an even larger amount for a lifetime sub. I don’t need celebrities to calm me down. I am deleting my “free” app and looking for a smaller, more reasonably priced alternative. I suggest you do too. But by judging how many millions of people have already bought in and made “Calm” the next multi-billionaire corporation, I doubt many will listen. “Calm” can put all of the touchy-feely marketing descriptions they want on this app. They are still just another greedy profit motivated corporation. If you take just one thing from my review to remember, I hope it’s that last sentence. Thanks for reading.,I am often on the Calm App.  I am a Psychotherapist and I have used Calm to center myself and to help Clients with discomfort caused by thoughts and moods.  It was, in fact, a Client who thanked me so enthusiastically for sending her the original Calm App that made me investigate the app for myself.  I think it would be good if all helping agencies offered the premium version to their customers - especially medical offices and health insurance companies.  Kaiser offers it free of charge to customers.  This is a wonderful thing.  Go to Calm.com.  See for yourself.,Not much useful,I used this like a year ago and I had 1 or 2 free stories a month. Now there are no free stories and ITS $70 YEARLY. I can buy a full priced game and still go to Wendy’s and get a couple 4 for $4s and have leftover money. and just get the same high quality stuff on youtube for free.,When I couldn’t sleep I remember that there was this app called calm so I tried it out and it work I normally wake up at 1:00 but now I wake up at 9:00.so download this app  and I hope this message helps you,Wack.,Though I was download a free app but when download basically every option is locked unless you pay for it will just use YouTube for white noises and video to help sleep,This app I full of crap with your stupid little story’s.  poop you you are mindless dummies and have big fat noses. And it is full of BEEEEEPPP!!! yes I just said that,I like the daily check inns, the music, and the backgrounds, but, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE! Granted though the daily check inns and the music are all very helpful but you can’t exactly do anything elseInteresting on the app, so I do not recommend this app. I think that they should at least warn you that you’re going to have to pay a monthly fee.If there’s a way that you could only do half of the stars I would do a 2 1/2 stars because it did help me relax from time to time,Downloaded the app and was immediately hit with “$69.99 fee for a year” message. Absolutely nothing was unlocked or available to try until you enter credit card info. No thanks.,I signed up for Calm premium after receiving a free promotional year subscription with my American Express card. I love it! The sleep stories and the soundscapes are my favorite. I use them EVER.DAY. I like the meditations but find some a bit too chatty.  \\n\\nI’m a therapist and I have recommended it to SO many of my clients who struggle with anxiety and/or have difficulty falling asleep with great success. \\n\\nI do wish there were more Scottish accent sleep stories 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️😎.  David Tennant, Richard Armitage, Peter Capaldi... 🙏,I hate how you need a subscription to do anything on here. I got this app so I can get rid or reduce my stress and anxiety, but I can’t because you need a subscription to do that. I recommend any other app, so long it doesn’t make you pay for a subscription. I even recommend using YouTube over this,I’ve tried the other big meditation app before and it worked well enough, but I think Calm is better! I’ve also tried to use YouTube videos but in all honestly I prefer a dedicated app. I also enjoy the sleep sounds before bed and have been using that with a sleep timer so that it turns off automatically. So much to discover in this app and I’m only getting started!,Ok,I didn’t buy the plus,but I don’t think that it would be worth the money.Also,almost EVERYTHING requires plus!\\n\\nTo app creators,1 please make it cheaper at least,2please make more access without plus.,Like this is just a wast of time everything is locked you need premium for everything like omg this is a wast of money just go to YouTube this is a bad app for my opinion like add something free😡,If you’re willing to pay a well amount of money for an app, go for it. There are free things but not many, everything is locked without a payed subscription. I found a lot of the library on youtube so i wouldn’t really recommend.,Warning for anyone interested, this app is not free. is the content useful? yes. Do i get somethin out of it? yes. is it 69.00 a year? yes.,I wouldn\\'t spend the full amount but if you get a discount code I would definitely sign up, meditation is something that I really am starting to understand and enjoy,I downloaded the “free” app, but almost anything I try to access, I have to start a “free trial” that will cost 69.00 a year. I love the gurgling creek when I access the app but that’s about it!,I used this app to help me sleep, then the trail ended, and now there’s no point on keeping it. Like I’m not paying money to keep myself calm. This app is a joke and doesn’t deserve all the stars it has. I can listen to this for free on YouTube. Like come on now.,I expected some things to not be available but nearly EVERYTHING was unavailable unless I paid monthly. Might as well pay for the app instead of touting it around as a “free” resource to help calm your mind. I guess I’ll stick to YouTube. Too bad I probably would have liked this if they only made it so I could at least enjoy some of their features.,It’s expensive but it’s definitely worth it if you utilize it correctly I mainly use it for meditation and sleep it helps clear my mind and ease stress there’s always a bunch of new content. You can always take the time and youtube the same stuff and save the money but the app is about convenience and worth it if you actually use it because I’d never get on youtube to meditate personally,Will you be really surprised if I tell you that this is a deplorable opportunistic app, that consists of various audio loops you can listen to for free on YouTube, packaged in a clever new age user interface? Well, you shouldn’t be.,Please add a queue functionality - similar to YouTube or Spotify.  I love love this app and have used it daily for myself and my children for almost 1 year, we love the sleep stories. My biggest complaint is the lack of a queue... Why is this? Currently, a sleep story ends and I’m still awake, so I have to get back on my app and play another sleepy sorry. This is a huge interruption of my “calm”.  I would love to be able to build a queue of a few sleep stories and a soundscape, so they all play consecutively. Please add this functionality!,Sure the app itself is free but if you want to access virtually anything to help your own mind it’s $69.99 a year - used to be better years ago with a lot more free content ... clearly someone got greedy. Won’t be using this app ever again,This review is for the free version, which is more of an ad than an app, and isn\\'t worth downloading. The free \"version\" has nearly no functionality other than promoting the pay version. Nearly all the content is locked. Better off with the free version of Breathwrk, or just using guided meditations on YouTube. The pay version might be really great, but there is absolutely no way to tell without paying or risking paying if you forget or have trouble stopping the automatic subscription after the free trial.,you have to pay 14.99 a month or 69 annually.,Great app,I Downloaded this app to hear some cool and relaxing sounds before I went to sleep but I instantly regretted it because they tried charging me 70 dollars a year for some sounds I could look up on YouTube for free don’t download this app it’s a scam,I tested the app two days ago, for one night, but never went to the purchase page to buy it because I wasn’t interested (since it didn’t actually help me get to sleep).  So, even though I never purchased it, I was charged $69.99 today for the full app.  I can’t seem to reach anyone at Calm to take care of it, so I’m asking my provider to file a grievance.  Ridiculous that I have no access to my account even if I didn’t actually ask for an account!,Absolutely no point to downloading this.. There is zero free content so you you essentially have to pay monthly to gain access. I’ll stick to YouTube thank you very much....,This is a GREAT app that just keeps getting better and better. I have been a fan for 4 years and it has come a long way since then. I will say hat at the beginning there was a lot more free content BUT it really is worth the money. I bought during the Black Friday deal $30 for a year. And I use it Every. Single.Day! As background music for work, during a walk, for a mindful moment, to ground myself when I feel stressed or anxious, and my son and I listen to Sleep Stories. Puts him to sleep. This app is a winner! If you need mindfulness in your life, buy it!,I’ve been working 100 hour weeks for 3 years now and haven’t treated my body or mind well at all.\\n\\nDownloaded this after one of the panic attacks I started getting in year 3 (I don’t have anxiety... just years of stress with little sleep) and never looked back. This platform has made mindfulness accessible to a much larger audience - nothing in here is “new” per se, the differentiator is in the breadth and depth of their practices, how clean and professional they are (no more risky clicks on YouTube), and how much variety is included.\\n\\nThere is music, guided meditation, stretching, stories, soundscapes and more that I haven’t even used yet. All of the material is tailored - for a certain level of user (neophyte to expert), a certain situation (stress, anxiety, sleep, city life, etc.), or a given amount of time.\\n\\nThis app is what you make of it. Take it from someone who has never practiced meditation before and even doubted it’s efficacy, an investment banker so focused on achievement that he abused his body and mind for years. This app is a lifesaver, maybe literally\\n\\nAnd I did the free trial at first expecting to cancel before getting charged, but I’m excited to be a paying customer now. The quality of life improvement alone is more than worth it. If you’re already an expert and want to do your own thing, great - this app can augment your practice. And if you’re a beginner like me, this app is the perfect base of support you’ll want to start taking this type of thing seriously.,Unless you want to pay for the full version, then look up a relaxing music playlist on YouTube, sit in a dark room, and breathe deeply. That is literally all this app does.,Honestly I get it, they want to make their money. But not all of us have the luxury to pay for stuff like this. They took away so much and now all the worthy stuff is only on premium. Plus why would I pay when there is endless content for FREE on YouTube. I always direct people to just go to YouTube since there is different types of mediations and sleeping videos/sounds. Also, if you have Spotify, I recommend that too. Don’t spend money unless you need to.,The app is fine. Just fine. It has quite a few hiccups with audio pausing randomly (when using AirPods Pro on-hear controls), and this baffles me, as even cheaply made freemium apps have no problem with this.\\n\\nMy issue is with the content vs. pricing structure. The subscription is annual. That’s it. No monthlies or quarterlies. Annual, with a 7-day trial.\\n\\nThe problem is... this app still feels very much like it was released years ago, on a Verizon Droid phone (the ones with the big clock and weather on Home page). There is that suspicious, rough-around-the-edges “look and feel” that just screams “2012!!!”\\n\\nAs for the content, most of it, except the Calm-exclusive stories and ambient sounds, is available on Spotify or Apple Music (or Deezer or etc etc etc). So you’re paying a flat $70 for an app that still feels like it is milking a business model created in 2016 (but it’s been 5 years), while also paying for that same content on your preferred music streaming service. Think about that for a moment, and now think about the pricing structure.\\n\\nImagine paying an annual fee for Safari (even if the fee were $50), so that you could “ask website not to track you.” That’s what this feels like at times.\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong. The stories are nice. The ambient sounds are nice and high quality. But that’s it. I think a reassessment of both, the UI experience and products offered, and the pricing options, could go a long way. That is, if the execs at Calm Inc. still find their vision viable. I know I do, but not like this.,I finally tried calm! The sleep story ads I\\'d get on Youtube helped my anxiety at times, and now that I am practicing mindfulness and meditation consistently, I figured I\\'d download it to sort of help me get the basics. I can say I really enjoyed the \"How to Meditate\" series, and the layout is very pretty and simple, but that was all I could really get into. \\nWith all due respect, I found the main narrator\\'s voice more distracting and bothersome than relaxing. I found myself getting slightly startled or jumping whenever she spoke up throughout meditations that were meant to help me sleep. This never happened with other guided meditations I\\'ve followed or with my hynotherapist, who\\'ve all had soothing voices. I tried changing narrator, as suggested by Calm, but on all of the meditations I\\'ve been using, there are no other voice options. \\n\\nMeditation aside, the other features on the app are nice, however, I can find soundscapes and peaceful music on Youtube, Spotify or other free soundscape apps. So while Calm is a great idea and clearly useful for many, I just can\\'t say I feel it\\'s worth continuing to pay for for me personally.,I barely used this app. I removed my subscription and deleted the app months ago. Now I see that I am charged $69.99. Even logged into the app it says I do not have a subscription. I am very angry about this.,I love the app. Well I used to. It helped me a lot. And now that I come back to it every had to be bought if not everything most things . When I know they used to be free. I’ll keep using until I can find an all free one but even then I still won’t pay “69.99” for premium.,So I understand that apps have to have premium to make money, but u can’t make 99/100 of the services require premium when it is over $60 a year! One of the videos that I really think I could’ve used didn’t have a premium sign on it and I got pretty excited, but when I went to click on it it showed me the premium subscription cost! I was very upset and as a result it did quite the opposite of help with my problems! Don’t recommend this application!,Price is way too high. It should be 4.99 a month not 14.99 a month. That’s a rip off.,I love calm.com I sort of wish that it made more kids story\\'s more quickly and that it also loded more quick,I have been using this app for a few years now. I’ve loved it until now. When I open the app it doesn’t do anything but say take a deep breath. I’ve waited 5-10 min at times for something else to happen, and it never does. I have paid for this app, and can’t even use it. It’s not helping to stay calm when you pay 59.99 for the app to not work! If I don’t have to give it any starts I wouldn’t. Before I would have happily given 5 stars now I don’t even want to give one. Haven’t been able to use for almost 2 months!!!,Sooooooo goooooooooooooooooooooooooooood,You can use anything on the up unless you sign up for their “free 7 day trial” which will make you pay $70 if you forget to cancel. Not taking that chance. Also I have a feeling they are deleting reviews and manipulating the ratings to trick people into thinking this is a good app. Which the app itself seems nice but it just comes off as predatory and scammy to charge $70. They’d probably be able to lower the price if they didn’t spend so much on YouTube ads, it seems like 1 out of 3 ads i get is for Calm.,I see there is another review saying there are free options, BUT THERE ISNT. I downloaded this app for soothing sounds and music to go so sleep too, but none of it is free! Not one thing on there. Except for the the fact that is plays like a cricket sound in the background automatically, but it’s not very soothing to fall asleep to. Trust me. I’ve tried. So, I wouldn’t even bother with this app unless you are interested in paying $69.99 a year if i remember correctly. I didn’t really Test any other of the things you can do on there, but I would imagine they might require you to have premium too.,I try to follow cancelation, but app makes that difficult to find. Nearly $70.00 for app is too much!,Calm’s workday playlists have really helped my focus while working. I have tinnitus in both ears, so it really helps me tune that out. However, it’s usually a bit of a pain to get it working right in the morning. I typically have to close out of any other app which plays audio (podcasts, Spotify, etc) or Calm seems to automatically pause what I’m listening to as soon as I navigate away from the app (similar to if you’re listening to something through your web browser and navigate away from that app). It’s just a little glitchy, hopefully they can patch those issues.,Like most things  like games and apps  theses days in the App Store unfortunately just for finding a app to help you relax  it too costs money! And this is not like a pay once done deal! Every freaking month you have to pay  an insane amount of money just for alleviating stress! It’s so laughably ridiculous since I thought the limited edition of the app would be better. I got this app since lately I have been feeling extremely anxious and stressed the past few months! I have tried everything without a single thing working. Like I have been unable to concentrate on my college work! My whole body gets ticklish like my arms and legs! I have been getting less sleep! Depression! You name it! When I saw this app I  thought this would finally break me free from my stress! Especially since there is no other app in the App Store which offers a variety of techniques to help me deal with the problems I have been dealing with lately! I enter the app and immediately get told most of the items are behind a paywall which is bad enough! But I find some items are available. So I think, Oh well I’ll try those  instead. Today I tried the 7 days of managing stress session. The session was awesome! And I felt so relaxed and more focused after the first session! But to my anger I saw unfortunately even for the sessions which are available you can only do the first day!  The locks on those days which indicate the paywall are so barely visible I didn’t notice them until now at a closer glance.Thanks to this awful  realization my stress actually came back! My nerves flared! My ticklish feeling came back! And my mind became back to feeling restless! Ironic isn’t it you stupid devs?! I was so enraged to be played like this that I am immediately typing this review with hopes you will understand my frustration and anger and do something about this issue!!!!!,I give this app 2 stars because, When I go to the section of sounds for sleep they are all locked and I have to have a free trial for 7 days just to unlock them. I don’t want to pay after 7 days, And actually all of the sounds are locked tbh. So if you want to pay $69.99 a year then I guess this app is for you? And I know it says cancel anytime but... Idk anymore. I hope this helps🙂,For some reason the app isn’t working after the update on 2/14/21.  Can someone tell me why?  I’ve been using this app for a long time and now I get a purple screen saying to take a deep breath. What’s up???,As of today, 2/15/21, the few days old update has caused the app to be unable to load. The main, “Take a deep breath,” screen simply remains up and app will not launch.\\n\\nThere have been numerous reviews posted stating this same thing about the latest update and we, your users (many of us, like myself, paid Premium users) are frustrated and the developers at Calm have not responded to a single review regarding this latest update which has caused the app to be rendered completely useless. At the very least, the developers at Calm should be responding to the myriad of disgruntled customers of the Calm app regarding when a fix update is to be expected, or if a fix is even being worked on. That’s just basic customer service 101. Yet, it’s nothing but radio silence from the Calm app developers. \\n\\nI am a Premium paid subscriber and have used, and loved, Calm for quite a number of years. I specifically use Calm for the soundscapes to fall asleep to every single night. However, Calm is not the only app which offers these soothing soundscapes and if you Calm developers don’t start responding to us, your users who have built your app into the very popular app it has become, we will start canceling our subscriptions and use other very similar apps with nearly identical features who also provide basic customer service to their users, something you at the Calm app are sorely lacking!\\n\\nA week ago, prior to the update which killed the app from launching and then seeing that nobody from the Calm app was acknowledging the upset users of the Calm app, I would have given the app 5 stars... after this PR debacle I would give you ZERO STARS if I were able to, as you at the Calm app have shown just how little you care about your users and their experience with your app. Shame on you, Calm!,After the latest update it would freeze on the opening screen “take a deep breath.” Extremely ironic that the app I open when I’m trying to “calm” down infuriates me more than anything. I pay the $70 a year for premium content so this is unacceptable. I fixed the issue by deleting the app and re-downloading it, but now even after logging back into my account ALL my data, my stats and streaks, my previous reflections and gratitude lists, have all vanished. I feel like someone tossed my diary on the fire. All those thoughts I can never get back. I finally got it working and now I’m so upset by the loss of my history in the app, there’s no way I’m meditating. Even before this latest issue with freezing, the app was already pissing me off by randomly not playing the background scenes I had set up. All of a sudden the meditations would play but only with silence in the background though I had a scene selected. Definitely will NOT be renewing the ridiculously overpriced subscription for an app that doesn’t function a lot of the time.,2/14/21 after the last update the app simple stop working. When I open the App it just stay in “Take a deep breath” and that’s it. Please help.,Sorry - app appears to be down as of 2-13-21.,I used to love using this app, but found myself using it less and less due to scheduling conflicts. For context, I used to have an android when I started using the app, and switched to Team iPhone at the end of 2019. Around the Summer of 2020, I struggled with the thought of cancelling my subscription because I really love the app, but I wasn’t using it at all. Finally in December of 2020, I heartbreakingly submitted a request through my Apple Subscriptions to cancel and remove the App. It is now February 2021, and after a month of not receiving any charges from the Calm App, I figured all was well. I was sorely mistaken. When I reached out to their customer service team yesterday, no one was available to reach out and get any information on my cancellation request. This morning at 1:00 am, I get an email from Valerii in the Customer Care department explaining the pending charge process, and that my service will be cancelled as of today. Even after explaining the circumstances of my original cancellation she was extremely rude and essentially stated that it was my fault that the subscription wasn’t cancelled, despite following the cancellation instructions for Apple products, which is listed on their website. I am now in the process of contacting their corporate offices and have reported them to my bank. Bottom line: make sure you cancel your subscription before getting an iPhone, or they will continue to charge your card through Google!,I love this app so much I fell asleep almost instantly listening but..Everything is locked.The soundscapes and music would be a great feature if they were free.You could go on YouTube to use that.I get you need to make money but at least make some of them free.Thank you.,I’ve been on & off with this app for several years now. Before there was much more free content for you to enjoy & helped you incorporate mindfulness into your life. That is the purpose for most downloading the app not just to “get the experience or a feel for it”. Can be a bummer for people actually struggling with stress or anxiety & you turn to this because you can’t afford actual therapy & most of the important lessons are locked. You’ll probably get 1 unlocked lesson & that’s it. Which everyone knows 1 single 10 minute lesson is not nearly enough to see noticeable improvement. There are not even any 100% free modules unless you’re just doing breathing or a timed meditation (& if you never meditated before or are using your 1 free lesson to help guide you, it can be confusing). I wouldn’t completely write the app off, they have nice speakers, & soundscapes but if you don’t spend $$$ you’re not going to get the experience you need. & that’s unfortunate for a lot of you. Probably would most benefit by watching mindfulness videos on YouTube & using the free parts of this in conjunction.,I love this app. I’ve been subscribing for years. Just trying to let developers know that after the update today the app won’t open. Purple screen with “take a deep breath” for several seconds and then it crashes and closes.,This app is wonderful but it runs extremely slowly for what it is. It sometimes crashes my 3rd gen iPad mini which is not so old it can\\'t run an audio player. For example, Apple music and Spotify both run fine on that device.,I’m trying calm out for the first time through my Kaiser membership and i love it, i been trying to figure out meditation techniques on my own searching the web and podcast YouTube etc. it’s helped a little bit, but you get lost in the noise and nonsense... what I like about calm, it lives up to the word calm...Calm actually teaches you about focusing your attention and with meditation it explains how to Focus your thoughts and calm your mind.. i also like the motivational people such as celebrities like basketball players and they talk about controlling emotions meditation it’s help me a lot in my life... after my free year membership i plan on keeping My membership with Calm,I’ve now had 2 annual subscriptions to this app. It offers a wide variety of meditation practices for many needs: Short, long, emotions, specific challenges, etc. My biggest complaint is there are very few meditations without a lot of guidance.  Tamara Leavitt seems to be in LOVE with the sound of her own voice and just doesn’t.stop.talking. The Daily Calm is great but instead of maybe a minute’s worth of a daily message, it ends up being too much time in a 10 minute session.  (Plus, she sounds preachy.) Please Calm folks, offer some sessions with minimal guidance!,Look this is the perspective of a 13-year old who wants to go to bed instead of using my so cut me some slack when I say this\\n\\nI can’t pay for this I would if I could I looks like such a good app I downloaded it and when I saw you have to pay for EVERYTHING I got really disappointed in the devs cause I feel lied to about the “free app” I downloaded I wanted to check out your app to help me sleep (and get off my phone) and I got angry about the fact that their is nothing for you to do in the app everybody wants to make a profit of some sort (money does run the world after all) but this is just outrageous and possibly the worst cash grab I’ve ever seen. In the ads I’ve seen it DIRECTLY SAYS “download the -FREE- app now” and that is a lie please unless you want to pay around 67.99 or around that (a year), you do you I can’t stop you, but again there is next to no free stuff to use and I’m extremely dissatisfied this app has SO much potential it’s crazy but it’s been crushed by greedy companies who could do so much better and still make a solid profit \\n\\nSo, that’s my review... hate me or not I just wanted to share my thoughts to help you consider downloading this app. So in the off chance you do see this please do consider this before downloading. And have a good day,If it was like an annual ten bucks then I would probably give it a try but I would rather spend that money on something cooler like Hulu or Spotify,I have an app that cost $50 a year and provides me with detailed multilayer maps of every state in county in the US, active GPS tracking, the ability to share with other users and a many.This app cost more and it’s pretty pictures and noises.  Completely unrealistic,Sorry but a lot of people are out of jobs and during a pandemic this app should offer monthly payments,I had this app before. Got rid of it because anything useful required a subscription. Saw promos that led me to believe there was free content now. Nope. No sleep stories. No music. I can breathe and that about covers it. Do yourself a favor and look up free content on YouTube.,Listen I love it but it’s just to expensive so I think you should add more free ones.I say this because I keep listen to this one it sounds really good I go to sleep before it’s don’t,if you could add more free ones I would really appreciate and a lot of other will.This report is coming from a kid that loves it but it’s too expensive,I hope you approve and thank you for reading this.I appreciate it😁😌🥱😪😴Love the sleep kid story’s thank and bye😌!,Cancelled on the 24th which is says in my ap store. Charged $69.99 on the 27th. Do not download. Find something free that doesn’t require sign up to even try the product. Scammy.  Cancelled before the week trial was up. Just trashy,For many of the core programs, the only speaker option is Tamara Levitt and her vocal fry/speech affect is so grating it distracts from the purpose of the app. It’s like Marianne Williamson’s mid century MidAtlantic accent crossed with a podcast host starting her own spinnoff from TAL. I cannot.\\n\\nYou can find other content, but what really killed this for me was the inability to push the broadcast to other smart speakers in my home.  Developers claim on Twitter that they’re “working on an Alexa skill,” but we pay for this app— I can push Spotify, which I pay for, to a speaker whether it’s Alexa, Google or Bluetooth. No reason this can’t do the same and it’s not a “skill,” it’s a feature you’ve chosen not to offer so you can extract more money. Unwise.,The subscription automatically purchased a full year after my trial for  $73.84. I understand moving trials to a paid option after their trial automatically, but a full year vs. month-to-month is shady. Yes, I should have added a reminder to cancel in my phone if I wasn’t fitting my needs, but to charge users for an entire year off the bat if that happens? That is one way how to make users no longer ‘calm’.,I used to have this app way back when it first came out and it really helped me even with the few things that you could have for free but now all those things are locked really?!?? Wth I don’t think that’s fair to people who can’t afford it and just want to be able to listen to white noise without YouTube ads. I get that y’all need money but at this point you’re being selfish you have millions of users who are more than willing to pay for the extra stuff why do you have to take everything else away for the people who can’t afford it or kids whose parents won’t buy it for them?!? \\nVery selfish and honestly I don’t even know why I re-downloaded the app in the first place such a shame. I used to boast to my friends about how great this app was but good lord have y’all changed.,I hate how apps DONT say that how much money it is to pay for the app.First I thought it was FREE but when I installed it said to pay 60.99 a year! I get really annoyed and just go to YouTube I bet that they have relaxing videos and meditation. I guess this is an ok app but I just wouldn’t pay for it.,Downloaded this as a last ditch effort to de stress and get some sleep. Just about everything is blocked by a paywall which in itself is pretty anxiety inducing. There are better soundscapes and meditations on YouTube.,Unless you plan on wasting money on their subscription, I wouldn’t recommend this app for anything. I got this to help me go to sleep, and I found that nearly everything required their subscription. Why would I pay for this when I could listen to the same sounds on YouTube for free?,Don’t even bother downloading this app. If there’s something you want from this app, just search for it on YouTube first, you’ll find it.,I NEVER write reviews, but this app made me delete it about three minutes after I downloaded it. I just wanted an app that would allow me to listen to relaxing music while I slept and would also allow me to actually shut my phone off during the night. I usually listen to sleep meditation music on YouTube (so I can’t lock my screen), but I often find my phone really hot in the middle of the night because of it. I was excited when I first opened this app and saw all of the cool features, but I was quickly disappointed when I realized you have to purchase a premium subscription to actually listen to about 95% of the content provided. What’s the purpose of that?? I get they need to make money, but then don’t make this a free app. Charge people to download this so they know what they’re getting themselves into. All in all, don’t get this app unless you’re willing to pay $70 a year to listen to calming music.,I used to love this app, I can’t afford the yearly prices they charge for it but I really enjoyed listening to one or two of their free sleep songs every night. Now out of nowhere they’re locked behind a premium cost and I’m so disappointed. Don’t get attached, just go to youtube.,Clickbait,I saw an ad on fb. Never mentioned the cost. I downloaded it, saw it’s 69.99/year. Deleted it immediately. \\nWould be nice to have the cost up front so I’m not wasting my time.,Downloaded the app and they immediately charged me $1 which was not disclosed.  Then there is basically zero content unless I fork over another 69.99 a year.  I want my $1 back.,I find this app calming but I don’t feel it is worth 69.99 for a year.,Dont get me wrong you CAN get what your offered AFTER you pay them a monthly fee. And they advertise it like you have a choice. You don’t. Absolute waste of time and money.\\n\\nJust look up stress relief and sleep aid videos on youtube. Does the same thing and they’re free of charge.,So you get practically nothing unless you pay the subscription. Saw the ad for bedtime stories and figured I’d give it a try. Not even one for free. Ya you can get the free trial but what’s the point if you still get nothing after it’s expired. The best method atleast IMO would have been a one time payment of like 5 dollars with limited access. Cycle the content monthly or whatever for limited access. Then if you wanna absolutely rob people have them pay the full subscription. If you’re like me just go to YouTube for peaceful bedtime stories. This is a laughably overpriced service. Edit: Was looking at reviews and THERE ARE STILL ADS lol Edit Edit: The downloads for this app are dying so they’re taking away content that was standard and putting it into premium. Super scummy move. It’s in its death throes so that’s one positive. Headspace is supposedly a much better app where they don’t try to rawdog you. Would definitely give them my business over this lunacy,App doesn’t really open on iOS. It opens but stays on initial screen & that’s all it does 1.15.21,I loved this app during my trial and decided to upgrade to the lowest level subscription with a monthly recurring charge. \\nCALM took it upon themselves to change my upgrade to a yearly premium subscription and charge me 79.99. \\nNot what I ordered and not what I wanted. \\nThese days, that is a lot of $ to have yanked away unexpectedly. I am not feeling CALM.,Love my Calm app and pay for a subscription...it has helped me get to sleep many nights and I have been using it for 2-3 years now.  But losing a star for not being compatible with Alexa devices.  Seriously what is the hold up?  Those devices were introduced in 2016...5 years later and you still can’t stream music through an Echo or Dot?????? In fact, from what I can see you can’t stream to ANY external audio device, even a BlueTooth compatible speaker.  Seriously do not understand.  Am I missing something?,Even though this app says it’s free, you have to pay to unlock quite literally everything worth listening too. I’m sure this app is great, I personally wanted to download for the soundscapes I’ve been seeing in ads. I’m someone who does not like to pay for apps because they’re unnecessary so it was a bummer. I’ll stick to my 8 hour soundscapes free on YouTube,Are used to have a horrible time falling to sleep at night during the day I want to get stressed and that I would get anxiety and overwhelmed with school I saw this on a YouTube ad and I download it and I thought oh no no these really work for me I don’t really use this sounds more like gentle talking but this has gentle talking and I Love the woman’s boys and I would recommend it for anyone who has anxiety gets overwhelmed cannot sleep or get stressed,Um. Yeah. Got this ad on Instagram of Nick Offerman telling a story and I thought, “what a neat, relaxing app! I will totally download this and listen to this! Even if it’s for free for one week!” (Which. It. Is. Not. According. To. My. Experience). I recall downloading this app probably around 7+ years ago or whenever it first began (it was awhile ago) and it was meh. Seriously meh. Now? It’s a lot better. I’ll admit that. For what I can speak of, after giving it a spin for the last hour or so. It’s pretty cool when it comes to almost every other app: I can actually check on something else and close out the app and it will still play. Great. BUT! I have two really big issues: 1) Advertising a famous voice which is literally only a few minutes of the WHOLE APP. Inaccurate advertising. Prove me wrong? Then yeah I’ll pay you all the fees worthy of proper advertisement. 2) So, I downloaded the app which immediately told me that it would be 1 week (6 days) for FREE and then I would have “the option” to cancel or to be charged the yearly amount which was something like $69— (don’t quote me on that, I don’t remember the exact amount). Nevertheless, within the literal SECOND after I downloaded this app (where all my Apple payments are connected to a PayPal account) I INSTANTLY got a PayPal notification pop up on my phone REGARDING THIS APP that charged me $21.22! Seriously! THE FIRST WEEK ISN’T FREE!!!!!!!???? What is this payment? Please refund and/or explain. Cancel my account, while you’re at it. And please be clear in your advertisements. Aside all this supposed, misleading small print, I think this app could actually be pretty great and I would use it quite often. I’ve spoken with others who’ve had similar issues. Don’t be misleading / cheap on something that could be a great app for people.,I would 200000% love this app HOWEVER you have to PAY to listen to Harry styles WHAT THE AHAJHAKSHAJFJJDCIJFJFJF. that is NOT fair. I am NOT paying $70 to listen to my husband speak to me. there is NO CHONCE. please make your app completely free :) thanks 🙄\\U0001f90c,This is a five star app. (If I could give it more stars I would.) I do have one complaint. I really wish it gave you more options for free. I could only open the first session on three different courses. And at the time I couldn’t pay for premium. This is a flaw. You need users to know what they would be paying for. But if you are willing to pay $70.00 a year, go right ahead.,I’ve had subs to Head Space and Brain.FM as well and this is by far my favorite.  Excellent across the board!  Love the meditation stuff, but so much else!  I use the soundscapes every day at work to get focused.,I just want to listen to rain sounds but I’m not paying $14.99 a month to do that.,I love it when it works. They should take the subscription money and rewrite the code.,I downloaded this bc with the world like it is I needed something to help me. I open it I can’t do anything without a subscription. They give you 7 days free then charge you $69.99 for the year!! Would be nice if they had some of the sleep stories and other stuff for free for people that could not afford it and that’s one reason most are stressed out! It seems great, just wish they had a few free stories.,There is literally 3 free things you can listen to. I counted. I could get better stuff from YouTube than this app. I was excited to use it but quickly saw that this app if here for money and not relaxation. If I could give 0 stars I would. The 1 star is for the calming sounds you have when you’re on the menu screen....😐,Asked me to sign up using email.  After taking info, THEN offers 7 day trial which requires card info.,how in the world do y’all expect people to keep your app if everything is locked. makes no sense. i used to love one of y’all’s stories but you locked it of course and now it’s just useless. people pay so much money just for an app with stories to help them sleep at night. ridiculous.,Literally can’t do anything without paying,i love the app but you need too have premium to unlock anything and i have trouble sleeping,I downloaded this app right after i had a panic attack and a friend told me about it. so far it’s helped a lot when i have my panic attacks . when my panic attacks start or i feel as if i’m going to have one i hit the rootr button and it gives me two options , help me feel okay and let’s do this which are very helpful because if i just need a little bit of assistance with my panic attack i can hit the let’s do this button then it still gives you help and walks you through a little bit but it is a lot faster then if you hit the “help me feel okay “ button it says a lot of different things that help make you feel okay. and you can even tap the screen to have them read aloud to you. and it keeps going and asks you if you feel the panic had ended and if you hit the no button then it keeps going through things but if you hit the yes button then it’s over with . overall i gave rootd a 5/5 stars because of how helpful it is .,I have never written a review for any app before, but I had to for this one if it means possibly helping someone. I have tried many anxiety relief apps that I ultimately end up deleting because they simply aren’t effective. They always seem so limited and robotic, and this is a breath of fresh air from that. It makes me feel supported, like I’m not going through this alone. There are two options for when you need help, which adjusts to your mood, depending if you want to be comforted or if you feel like fighting your anxiety that day. There are features that make this journal seem more honest and real, instead of just going through the motions. Honestly, thank you for this. If you deal with anxiety on a daily basis or get attacks, I urge you to get this app. You might find it more helpful than you expect. Wish you all the best 🤍,This app makes me feel like I’m not as alone as I normally would feel. I am a 14 year old girl who is struggling with depression, body imagine and most of all anxiety and panic attacks. They are very scary and make me feel like I’m stuck in a dream and can’t get out. I have a ton of medication but I thing seems to work, this app helps a lot! Knowing that I’m not the only one who feels this way and I’m not alone, I never thought life could get this hard especially so early on but it can and it did 😢 this app helps me breathe and focus. I have only had it for 2 days and I feel better about panic attacks and anxiety! I still feel alone and scared a LOT but trust me this can and WILL help you so I suggest giving it a try.,I am really grateful for this app! I have started having panic attacks recently and was very confused and worried about my health. I have done a few medical exams, but did not find any serious issues. However, every time i am starting to feel anxious, i keep on thinking that something is wrong with me and wind up having a panic attack feeling like i am suffocating and losing ground. Reading the Rootd explanation of how panic attacks work really helped me calm down and prevented an onset of another attack. Just by having an app on my phone i am already feeling more confident that i can deal with a panic attack (which hopefully won’t occur at a level it has before simply due to the knowledge of having Rootd support). Thank you, Ana,I am afraid to die and no one wants to but when I found this app I instantly used it my panic attacks are hard to calm down I breathe heavily I feel like I have to faint and with this app it help me so much I am not an adult and it is not crazy because kids are afraid of something and my fear is dying but my family and this app told me to feel better and that death is apart of life and I was back on my feet but I still get them so I use this so my panic attacks can go away and I do not have fear anymore I love this app and if you have anxiety you should use this app because this calmed me down and it will do the same to you help you get rid of your anxiety and fears.,i really like this app. i mean REALLY like this app. i wish we could give half stars because it would be a 4.5 star rating. the only thing that keeps me giving a 5 star rating is that the education or techniques are seemingly limited and don’t renew themselves. \\n\\ni tried the premium version on a week trial base. i even found myself wishing for more techniques and education to be available because i had gone through a great deal of it. i couldn’t help but wonder whether i would eventually get bored with this app and forget that it existed or move onto to something else that seemed to better meet my need for a little more variety and choices. \\n\\nthat aside, i do enjoy this app and find it helpful and the graphics are adorable. great job rootd.,Aa I assume whoever is reading this is doing right now, I downloaded Rootd (along with several several other anxiety relief apps) in the midst of a panic attack and I\\'m really glad I did. I had been going to therapy but it wasn\\'t really helping me understand how to deal with panic attacks when they\\'re actually happening, and I would often just cry it out. Thankfully, this made my attacks much shorter, it\\'s so user friendly and I really appreciate the affirmations it comes with in the SOS feature... while most apps just have a breathing graphic, I feel like I personally need affirmations during attacks and this is perfect for that.,I’ve been dealing with and learning about anxiety my whole life, and Rootd is one of the first apps that truly helps. Unlike the ones in general meditation apps, its “panic button” concentrates on the feelings of severe anxiety only some people face. The fact that the watch app speaks aloud instead of requiring headphones is a godsend. I do wish there was volume control, but I don’t think that’s a fault on the developer’s end. One thing I would say would push this over would be being able to select a number of “motivation notifications” throughout the day. I’m saving up for the lifetime version.,My friend told me about this app a few days ago. This morning, after a particularly rough nightmare, I woke up in a panic attack, grabbed my phone and stumbled to the bathroom to get sick. I remembered the app and hit the red button, reporting that I wasn’t doing well. The reassuring statements on the screen helped so much. I only experienced half the symptoms I normally do, and didn’t need my PRN!! Thank you so much! Your team is incredible for making something like this. I may have repeated my review twice but the one I submitted before doesn’t seem to have gone through so I’m writing a second one!,This app was recommended to me and it\\'s been an amazing tool for me to use during my panic attacks. It checks in on you daily. there\\'s also a section for journaling where you can input a variety of moods and emotions you may be experiencing. I also find the sleepr section useful for my mild insomnia, it definitely helps you relax. There\\'s a section for lessons that help you to understand what is going on with your body. It\\'s informative and keeps track of your progress. I ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it\\'s extremely helpful.,I have been diagnosed with panic disorder and have been struggling with finding different tools to help cope during these panic attacks. Obviously seeking medical help was step one, and getting into therapy was step two. However this app was able to really illustrate what anxiety is, where it comes from, why it’s happening, and how you can control it. The app uses cognitive based therapy techniques which is what you would be doing in therapy so it’s an excellent extension. I highly recommend this app for anyone struggling with panic attacks or anxiety.,I’ve only had this qpp for a few days but so far i’m liking it. I love how the prompts can be read out loud if you need that auditory reassurance. The panic button helps me to focus my anxiety onto something tactile and helps take my mind off of impending anxiety and panic attacks. It’s also subtle enough because it’s in your phone, no one will know (unless you tell them) that you are having a panic attack. It’s only been a few days so I’ll have to see how it goes but so far so good!,me and a family member uses this app I wanted to find something manageable and simple for both us and i love the features and how you can get around the app. I love the reminders that you can set for yourself especially when you know when your attacks come into a certain mode of the day and that we can share each other accomplishments and goals. I am still working on the app but I hope this apps gets out for anyone that needs it.,This app has a lot of options to relieve stress including customization inside of those options! The app targets many different aspects of anxiety and offers reassurance as well as confidence building. Even if your not looking to stop panic attacks, You can still use the journaling, sleep and breathing feature just to make your life a little less stressful. I recommend this app for anyone with a busy mind who wants to calm down \\na bit!,My daughter (9) and I both deal with some anxiety, and I wish I’d known about this app a long time ago. We’ve been doing the breathing exercises and visualization together for the last couple of days, and we both love it! I haven’t hit the panic button yet, but after reading about how it works, I’m sure it will be an enormous help if I need it. I honestly believe this is an app that literally everyone needs to have!,I’ve been having terrible anxiety and panic attacks especially when driving. I’ve been looking everywhere for help on how to stop them or at least make them spread out. I like this app because it breaks down what happens during a panic attack and can walk you through it to calm you down. The panic button is a great touch and can call your emergency contact if you’re freaking out too bad.,I often end up downloading apps for anxiety and things like this and end up deleting them within a few days but this app is increasingly helpful, especially when I am experiencing a panic attack. The app also has many features like journaling, it teaches you about anxiety, and it has sections where you can focus on your breathing. I 10/10 recommend getting this.,My mom found Rootd for me, because I deal with panic anxiety. I have noticed that understanding the sensations that you feel when having a panic attack can help your mind calm down. I really enjoy how the app gives you all the information on what anxiety is, and how we can try to overcome our fears. I haven\\'t had the app for too long, but I\\'m hoping that it can be one of the tools to help me overcome anxiety. 🙂,I’ve been dealing with A LOT of stress at work recently, but last week was, by far, the worst. I had my first full-blown anxiety/panic attack in months and could not pull myself out of it. I started looking for breathing exercises online and found Rootd. It was a lifesaver. I went through the breathing exercises a couple of times and was finally able to, well...breathe again. Thank you.,I like this ap. I opted for the free trial. I’m under extreme stress and therefore, countless panic attacks. Literally sometimes I think I’m loosing my mind, I’m not. And I’m okay. You can select breath (much like the Breathe ap in Apple Watch). You can select Rootr who provides you with guidance during panic attacks. I went through the entire Rootr screens and prompts. Hopefully my panic attacks which are anxiety, go away. This is a keeper.,I love that Rootd explains so much and gives the science behind anxiety. I feel like if I can rationalize what’s going on in my body it helps me feel better. Everything in their lessons is incredibly reassuring. The different tools they provide you to help with anxiety and emergency panic attacks are phenomenal. I just wish that they had some longer sleeprs, visualizrs, and breathrs,I am new to this app and loving it! I adore the cute Rootd monster and the low pressure journalling feature. The courses are also delightful!\\n\\nI would pay for premium if there was an option to see a chart of your moods over time. \\n\\nI highly recommend this app to anyone struggling with their anxiety but finds other apps in the App Store useless.,I would give this 5 stars however I have two problems 1. For the lessons I understand that you need to have money but what if you made it so you had to watch a ad 2. During the panic attack button it said you don’t experience panic attacks 24/7 but what if you do like me for instance I’m younger and yet I still have panic attacks almost always,I’ve never been able to really relax with any meditation type apps. I’ve been having really bad anxiety and depression issues for about 2 weeks and the doctor recommended Rootd. It helps to ground me and really stop and calm down for a few minutes. Definitely will keep using and highly recommend!,I downloaded this on a whim and I was very impressed with the over all experience. The graphics are simple in my opinion, they are not over whelming with bright colors. I like that I can set reminders to do things with in the app at certain times. It’s been 3 days and I feel calmer in some of my daily routines.,I had been looking for an App to help me with my anxiety. I have found several meditation apps, but none as comprehensive as this app. Meditation is one of the modalities used, but this app really educates you! It walks with you hand in hand through education and healing. I recommend this app to everyone! Especially in these unprecedented times!,I have relied on Rootd to help me through difficult times. It has been so beneficial. Through the app and with help of a therapist, I have seen major improvement. You won’t be disappointed. Even if you can’t get to a therapist, practice the lessons on Rootd. You’ll learn about your strengths too!,I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and I’m always looking for new strategies for relief. This was recommended by a friend and it not only help alleviate my physical symptoms, it did so in a way that was helpful. Rootd did not just try to distract me (that can only wait to for a moment or two). Rootd used science and reminded me that my physical symptoms will diminish. And they did!,It’s been two days and I already feel this app is a game changer. The way it helps you through panic attacks is incredible. It doesn’t coddle you, but it still calms you. The trick to it is....you have to want to do it. Be open, let the app do its thing, and you’ll be amazed at how well it works!,I’m suffered from panic attacks for so long. Medication helped but now they are starting to come back. This app really makes me feel like someone out there understands how it feels to have such painful anxiety. Great app and it has really helped me to feel calmer. It’s not an attack, just a sensation.,I enjoy the multiple options available for de-stressing. The lessons are calming to read, the journal helps you keep track, the ambient noises help you relax and the breathing and visualizer act as pacers! Would recommend to anyone who likes to try out different options!,I would suggest this app for anyone who suffers from Daily panic attacks and anxiety as it helped me when I was having a full out attack while driving and being 1 hours away from Home. It truly felt like I had a counselor alongside me pushing me to feel better.,I downloaded this in the middle of a panic attack and after using 3 rounds of the prompts using the button I felt so much calmer. I’ve been using the journal and visualizer and it really improved my mental health. Thank you to all the amazing people who came up with the prompts,Very helpful, and educational. If you are practicing good mental hygiene this will be very useful. Pressing the button when you are having a panic attack makes you more in control, I really like that feature.,This app really helps me when I’m feeling anxious! And it’s so convenient to have everything right there on your phone for easy access. I especially love it for when I’m feeling a panic attack coming on at work.

The button for panic attacks has helped me multiple times and offers affirmations that are really helpful in moments of distress.,I highly recommend this app I have been suffering in silence with my pain attacks and felt crazy by my doctors always found no reason for my feeling racing mind and trouble at night sleeping so happy I found this app it helps,I have only had this app for a week but there is some really useful information. I think that the UI is very easy and understandable. I’m looking forward to seeing how this can help.,If you are ever having any problems mentally, download this app! Especially during this pandemic when we couldn’t have been more far apart, this app is what you need to achieve mental well-being!\\nJames,I’ve tested a few of these apps. If you’re in the grips of terror and feel like your chest is caving in, then this won’t help once panic grips you, but if the guy in front of you cuts you off on the freeway, fire it up on Bluetooth and it may lower your heart rate a couple bpm.,I’ve only had the app for about 3 days now but I can’t tell you how many times I’ve already used it! It works well and the best part is it teaches me better self regulation techniques,This app is informative and helpful. What works best for me when having an attack is to understand what’s happening with my body and mind and practice breathing techniques. This is exactly what the app helps with. Would recommend,I struggle with anxiety and have panic attacks. This app has definitely helped me calm down when I didn’t want to do anything drastic like text my therapist- LOL! It’s a great way to challenge the anxious thoughts and push into the panic attack, thereby taking control of the situation.,I downloaded the app with doubt in the beginning, cause I’ve tried quite a few anxiety services. Then I found this one is for real! it really helps and I’ll surely continue to use Rootd on a daily basis:),I’m so glad I found this app! An app that teaches CBT?? That keeps trauma based coping skills at the tip of my fingers?? A place to go during a meltdown or panic attack?? Amazing!! Incredible!! I honestly can’t believe this exists... but, I’m incredibly grateful that it does. Thank you, Rootd!!!,I downloaded the app during a panic attack and it made me be able to calm down. It has helped me slow my thoughts during panic attacks many times! 10/10 recommend!!,I started using this tool to help me get through cravings during my quitting smoking journey. It quickly became so much more. I’ve noticed my anxiety and panic moments have almost diminished. It’s been a breath of fresh air (pun intended)!,As a person who just started experiencing anxiety attacks, I’m grateful that there are apps like this to help. The information was general but good.

The educational lessons and the emergency support button have been really helpful.,I purchased this app, went to use it and got nothing but a blank screen.

The content of this app, it has helped me through a very stressful and anxious week. For some reason this week alone I’ve had daily panic attacks, but this app has helped tremendously with relief. I love the factual information they send you with the panic button. I can’t recall what I already know when I’m in a panic state; I lose all sense of reasoning and fact finding, so reading the information in this app helps a lot with returning to a coherent calm state, and reminding me of what I already know about panic attacks. \\n\\nMy favorite part is Rootd’s push to help you overcome and understand your anxiety issues from a root cause level, rather than just a quick fix. When on the purchased version they provide tools to help you investigate and resolve your root issues. This helped me identify several causes of my panic attacks from this week, and I see some long term patterns that have been toxic in my life. I am starting to build confidence and feel in control again! \\n\\nSo now the reason for 4 stars instead of 5:\\n\\nI ran into a snag with the purchase. I bought this on my laptop, and the directions said to open up the app on my mobile and restore purchase. It didn’t work. I tried multiple times across multiple days. After three days of no success I contacted support through the website contact form. No response, ever. I finally found the email to contact the company directly through my emailed receipt. Once I got in touch, they validated my purchase and unlocked the premium content on my account. Phew! \\nBTW, they are very friendly and helpful, they just need to fix their website. Thanks Rootd!!!,Very helpful for mental health/ anxiety!,it helps me a lot !,Finally, an app with a very intuitive approach to keep panic attacks at bay.

Useless.,This app is very good at its job; and I’ve only been using it for a day. Even though you have to pay for somethings still, it’s not getting in the way of you using the app. At all really. Are use the free version and it’s still great. Like with some other apps you have to bye like pretty much the entire thing to be able to use the app and if you don’t want to buy it then it’s pretty much just getting in the way of you using the app in its entirety. Which is quite annoying (specially in the fact that that’s pretty much every app out there). I am only reading this app five stars because of what I’ve seen so far. I haven’t been using it for that long clearly, but it still seems to be working. I love how you can customize pretty much the entire thing just to your liking. It is very good with letting you speak without caring. Like when you sometimes need to just talk but you can’t talk to specific people or you just feel like you can’t talk to specific people; yes well now you can. I love how you can just speak into it and not even care. Very good tool for remembering your thoughts and how you felt. Sometimes in the moment you don’t quite remember all of the things that happened to you and that day that you would like to remember and sometimes writing it down just doesn’t quite cut it. Anyways overall this app seems to be pretty good. It’s cute, it makes me feel good about myself, and makes me feel happy overall. I would recommend this app to a friend.,I reached out to the reflectly team to get help for my issue below and Nicole reached out to me with a very supportive response and was able to immediately fix the issue and get me my membership. I really appreciated this and am happy to be starting my new year with this app! Thank you again! \\n\\nI downloaded the app and it immediately asked for a year subscription, I was interested and decided to buy. It purchased and had me do my first log of my mood. I did that and everything was great! But then it asked me to create an account so I typed in my email address and it said this is already in use, maybe try signing in? So I backed out of the app to go back to the home page where i could sign in and I signed in successfully. But I checked my account and not only is my first log missing but the subscription was missing and it said \"basic plan active\" so I was confused and clicked on the \"activate reflectly\" and clicked redeem offer to see if when it connects to my apple account it will recognize I have already paid for the subscription. Well it didn\\'t and charged me again because I got a text from my credit card saying I was charged another $63 but the app said \"error occurred\" and never gave me the subscription anyway! Point is I have two payments of this year subscription and no subscription. Please help,I love Reflectly. The UI is absolutely gorgeous, the animations are slick, and the whole app is great to use. The check-ins are great, and the voice notes and photos are also a great addition. I love adding a photo or two that highlight my day. The app’s been doing a lot for me, and I love it. However, there are a few improvements that could make it even better. First, the iPad app is pretty bad. It works, but there’s no trackpad support, so things are still pretty awkward. The text formatting is awkward (there’s no cursor, so you don’t really know where you’re typing). I’d like to see a more advanced text editor for journaling with rich text formatting, inline image support, different (preset?) text sizes, bullet lists, the works. After all- the app costs $60/year. Apple Pencil support would be wonderful, it would be great to have a hybrid journal with typed entries in addition to handwritten entries. Support for scribble would also be a welcome improvement. Another great improvement would be the ability to add videos along with images. I’m unsure if Reflectly is already encrypted, but it would be a great idea to include the option to encrypt your journal and its entries with a custom key like Jour does.,Lets start off with how AMAZING this app is! This app calms me down when i do check-ins and lets me kind of express my feelings when there is nothing to express them too. I also love the inspirational quotes i get everyday, and how i get to chose how many times a day i get them ( I personally set mine to 8 x a day)! And i love how i can view my stats , i also love how you get to CHOSE if you pay for premium and if you don\\'t you still get let into your app and get to experience other features unlike other apps.. and to end off my review it is amazing and i definitely recommend it ! Its not like other diaries and then again keeps me calm because Reflectly asks me questions that if i was writing in my diary i would just be straight forward, wright about it and be done! But here they ask you questions so its like talking to a person but now having secrets and people talking about it and sharing things that happened to you when its none of there business( i experience that alot). Then again i love this app and I totally recommend it! Get it if you don\\'t have it already! Thanks for reading , bye!,I’ve had this app since i believe January of last year, and i started heavily using it during lockdown for covid and it helped me manage my thoughts and feelings and it became easier to progressively work through them. I was most of all enjoying the morning motivation, and for the end of the day check-in, it would ask a question of the day which was my absolute favorite part. However, in this most recent update, I’m unable to do either of these things without paying for a subscription. The only thing i can do for free is look at past entries and view the quotes page. What I don’t understand is if the purpose of the app is to journal, why do i have to pay to do it? And so suddenly too? It’s like a music streaming app offering music you can listen to for free and after your 3rd song, they make you shell out some cash if you want to keep listening to music. I wish they would consider going back to the original format, im sure most people would pay for the premium subscription, and then people who are satisfied with the free version can continue to use the app. It’s disappointing because I was really enjoying this app and how it was helping me and now i’m forced to find something else that’s suitable for me mentally and financially.,I have always been skeptical with mental health apps just because if you think about it, how can an app help me with my problems. This app does just that! In the morning you get one simple motivating task to do so you can get your day started off right and throughout the day when you feel the need to talk about your feelings you can. At night you have a prompt to help you better understand your problems. One thing that really has helped me is the notifications. That might sound weird but during the day the app will send you quotes and personally quotes like that inspire me to be better and I really like being able to choose ones that you relate to the most. After about five days of using the app to tells you about your feelings and if your getting better or not and other things. This app has made me feel better and actually got me to keep up with journaling I really recommend this to someone who wants or need to journal but can’t keep up with one this is for you.,I haven’t used the app for too long, but I already love it! All of the basic features are perfect for me, and the AI is marvelous!\\n\\nHowever, there are some serious problems with the app. Something that frustrates me significantly is your promotions for buying the full version of the app. I have no intention of purchasing the additional features because I cannot afford the full price once the promotion expires. What makes me angry is how I can’t even do my check ins, and I’m confused about what I can get for free. Every time I try to do a check-in, the promotion pops up. There is clearly something wrong with the app, because all of the top reviews are clearly from people who paid for the app, but there are other reviewers that are saying the same thing that I’m saying. Some older reviews even say that there were more features in the past, but you now have to pay for everything. If you are intentionally doing this, that is unacceptable. However I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nPLEASE MAKE THE APP USABLE FOR USERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE APP. If you cannot generate enough revenue from paid subscriptions, then make the price more reasonable. Add more payment plans if you have to! Please, fix this!,I have mental health problems, so my therapist recommend I try to use a mood tracking app. I was worried, as I don’t usually follow through and use these regularly. But the feature to have it check in multiple times a day, and to send positive remarks is an AWESOME feature.\\nHowever, I have a variety of mental health issues, and do understand that a company has to make their money. But the “positivity reminders” are limited to relatively random issues in the basic version. Anxiety, autism, wisdom are available, which I think is awesome. But a large client base is going to have depression and stress problems as well. If those options had tiers, it may be more affective for a wider audience of users. That would be willing to pay for those better options after seeing if the reminders are actually helpful. \\nI know there’s a trial, I just don’t think 3 days is enough time to see any actual mentality differences. \\nOverall, really like the app. Just wish it was a bit more widely usable for different issues without in-app purchases.,in all my years of having apple products i’ve never once written a review for an app. but this app... this... app... is the best journaling app i’ve ever downloaded. i’d been trying to get into consistently journaling for a few years now but nothing never really stuck, until i found this. i will admit, if you just have the free version it’s not worth it. paying ~$1.25 a month for this is a game changer. i write it in probably 3 times a day or whenever I’m feeling something/need to get words off my chest.\\nyou can track your mood, what’s making you feel that way, and emotion you’re feeling. \\nit gives you daily motivational quotes whenever you need them, however many times a day you’d like. \\nthe user interface is BEAUTIFUL and incredibly easy to navigate. i will recommend this app to any and everybody i know. \\nif you’re struggling with your mental health right now and looking for a way to help improve it, this is your sign. this app is for you. try it. it’s amazing.,I downloaded this app back in April. And I liked it because it was a place where I can write my thoughts out. Around December 26, I went to write in a journal entry and it would let me do anything if I didn’t go premium. I don’t know if this is a bug or it’s going to be permanent. Or they are doing this because they want people to spend money so that they can have money, so that the users can have a basic function like journaling. Or some users are just using the basic plan, like me, and they need or want extra money. I started to really like this app because it did the basic functions. But it doesn’t even allow you journal. How can an app that is meant for journaling not allow its users to journal without paying. I switched to Daylio and I fell like it’s better. You can actually do something’s that you couldn’t do on Reflectly like look at statics, even allows you to create goals for yourself. It has some features that Reflectly doesn’t have. I’m not telling that you should switch to Daylio. But I’m just saying that this has worked for me and I don’t really have any issues with it. Also Daylio doesn’t spam you with ads talking about switching to premium all the time.,I absolutely love this app! It helps me wind down and focus on my feelings. To be honest, it’s almost like the friend I don’t have who asks me if I am OK. You can customize the background to the color you like the most, and can do however many mood check-in’s you want at any time during the day. There is only one thing I am not a fan of with this app. I am aware everyone needs to make money and this app might be what puts food on the table for some people, but I don’t get why the membership has to be so expensive. First they give you the option for $15 dollars a year, which is acceptable, but they cut it down from $60 dollars? The features in the membership aren’t even that great, but there are a lot of them, which makes using Reflectly without the membership a lot less fun. However that is my only complaint and apart from that (mostly not being able to journal without paying) this is an amazing app that I 100% recommend to relax, reduce stress, and get to know yourself and your feelings better.,I do really like this app because it helps me with my problems at school and home. Sure, I have only been using it for one day but it really helps me a lot. I also like how it’s so cute like the little face that it shows helps me feel a little better and it will give you inspirational quotes and will try and help cheer you up. I first seen this on instagram and said “Maybe it won’t be so bad and will help” and I think it did. I may be young like younger than 14 but I do have lots of problems at school and home, and telling someone or something my problems makes me feel a little better. I personally think that talking through technology or paper is easier than talking in real life face to face with another, some stuff that also helps me is Minecraft, anime, gacha, and drawing. I recommend that you get this if you want something to talk to about your problems and you don’t feel comfortable with talking to real people like me.,I know this app is supposed to help improve mental health, but it’s doing the opposite for me. One big problem is that, within the app, there’s a timer counting down to when a special deal for premium runs out, and I’m scared of timers. There’s no way to close it; it’s always there, quietly counting down. Another problem is that it gives you a daily task. The one I got was to “say no to something you usually say yes to”. I was anxious the entire day because I didn’t know what I was going to say no to. I almost decided to say no to one of my meals since I’m overweight, but luckily, I had the brilliant idea to say no to the challenge instead. The third thing that makes me anxious is that it won’t let you journal after your free trial ends. Instead, it pushes you to get premium in order to use the CORE FEATURE of the app! This was the last straw that caused me to delete the app after less than 48 hours. It seems as though this app cared more about money than the well-being of its customers. Shame on you evil company for trying to take advantage of people’s poor mental health! You’re literally trying to make money off of people’s anxiety!!!,I have had Reflectly for over a year now and I will say that it is very personal for me. My Reflectly has been an outlet for all the strife in my life. I love the UI. It’s very user-friendly. You can add pictures to the days you write your reflections on, and it even helps you actually reflect and think about things in your life by asking you a question every day for you to answer. There’s no pressure to write entries, make pictures or write the answers to the questions. \\n\\nI have been through the hurricanes that nearly destroyed our custody and relationship issues, people taking advantage of us when we were in need, a shooting, family issues, accidental overdose resulting in seratonin issues and hallucinations, severe sickness, creepy hillbillies trying to mess with us, and of course the political climate of 2020...and because of this I have severe anxiety. Reflectly has a a friendly UI and non-agitating color scheme. They’ve only ever really made changes to it once that I can recall. \\n\\n     I recommended features to Reflectly and they actually communicated with me on Facebook messenger rather promptly. Come to find out, you can download your Reflectly in a PDF. The only drawback is that it messes up the parts where you separated your paragraphs, which is why for now my review is four stars. I think they actually listen to our concerns so it should be fixed soon. I’ll go back and check just to be sure.\\n\\n-R. Bivens,I liked the app at the start, but I downloaded it so that I could have something to record and reflect my feelings on, basically to use it for what it’s for. But I don’t like how after a few days you have to pay to keep journaling..I don’t have a credit card, and I already know that nobody in my family is going to pay for an app subscription for me. It stressed me out just to go on today and find out that I couldn’t let my feelings out and journal because I had to accept a deal to continue. I don’t care about the premium features or whatever it is, I just wanted something to write my feelings in that had less of a risk of being found by my family. \\n\\nThe app is good, it’s the fact that if you want to continue using it to keep you mentally stable you have to pay a fee. That doesn’t make sense to me. I felt that I would be able to use it without paying for the full version or the premium or something. The ads I’ve seen especially made me think otherwise.,So I downloaded this app in hopes to start journaling. To save the long story, it asks for a subscription practically every 3 seconds. And after your 3rd entry, it won’t let you do anything unless you pay for a subscription. If you want a free journaling app, I recommend Daylio, Mood app, or Day One. Thankfully I can still keep journaling because I downloaded multiple journaling apps in case something like this happened. I feel bad for all the other people on here who are upset. Some people have been using this app for years and now all of a sudden need a subscription. It’s just wrong. The only reason this app still has good reviews is because all of the five star reviews were posted a long time ago, before they asked for subscriptions. I think the subscription thing was applied recently because all the people complaining about it on reviews were posted this week at the time I’m writing this. If you read the good reviews from a year ago, people are happy because the app was free, but it isn’t anymore now so I think over time this app is slowly going to start getting more bad reviews.,I just got the app and right off the bat it seem pretty good. I don’t have a written diary or anything so when I’m on the road this is great for when I want to jot something down really quick. One reason I didn’t rate a full 5 ⭐️ was because of how many quotes your limited to.. I like the quotes but there are a ton of them when u subscribe. It just my opinion but I think that if you added a couple more like maybe 2 or 3 small categories for the quotes, that would really make it a great app. Other than that it’s been a great app for writing down my feelings 👍 \\n\\n-edit I saw the price when I went to the app and I miss judged. Most subscriptions or in app purchases are either money grabbers or scams. This one is actually really good and it’s a nice low price too. Once I get enough I wouldn’t mind going for the premium version. I’m changing my rating to a 5 star rating ⭐️👍,I really like this app not only because you can really tell “it” anything anytime you want. You can have multiple check-ins a day if you want too, if you skip any days there’s no notifications to tell you to come back and it’s completely your choice what you want to put down. Reflectively sends you emails about every day/every other day just asking about if you’re feeling ok or not, which is also completely optional. You can pay for Reflectively if you want to, but you don’t have too!! The app is just still really great and I don’t even pay for premium! You can change the settings anytime you want, and you can write notes on each day just saying how it was if you don’t feel comfortable telling someone through text and/or in real life. I think this app is/would be totally great for mentally unstable people, and it’s very calming. 10/10,Reflectly is a journal that gives you insights into what days you’re happy and what made you happy. Not only can you do that yourself, but its locked behind a $60 paywall. Sometimes they offer “Just for you!” discounts but they don\\'t actually drop the price at all. The quotes are a nice feature, not really a downside to them besides needing to pay to choose the type, but thats not a necessary thing. The app has a really sleek design that I love, but its annoying that you get a popup asking you to pay every time you open the app. If the team reads this, PLEASE stop with the advertising in your OWN APP. I understand that you have this service but it repulses me that it feels like one of those free mobile games where all the ads are for your own service. Finally, the actual journal checkins themselves. They are nice and helpful to get your thoughts and feelings out in an easier way than just seeing a blank page.,I got this app because I wanted to try journaling and I loved it so much. I have been doing a mood check in once or twice a day and I’ve been enjoying it. But today I tried to do a check in and now it’s trying to make me pay. I’m very disappointed because I really like this app and it was almost perfect. I really like the quotes that you can read, a lot of them are very inspiring and I like that you can like quotes and look back at them later. A lot of people don’t know how to look at your liked quotes so how you do it is you go to quotes, press the General button, (bottom left), then press Favorites, (to the right under categories and themes). I’m really sad that I can’t do the app anymore because I loved it so much. I might do a year of premium but I’m not sure yet. Reflectly if you are reading this I hope you consider changing that you make users pay after a couple days of journaling.\\nThank you,\\n        Fellow Reflectly User,I don’t normally do this type of thing but I’m really angry right now. This is one of my favorite apps and I have been going through so much the past year. This app has helped me a lot and I stuck by it even after the update that I didn’t like that much and made the daily reflection cost money. I really wish I could use this app but in order to do so I have to get a premium subscription which I do not have to money for. Recently my mother passed away and I was going to write about how I have been feeling because choosing the emoji that represents how I feel and writing out what happens helps more then you could imagine and now I don’t have my healthy coping mechanism. However, I understand that you guys need to make money and I totally respect that and I’m hoping that in the future I am able to get a premium subscription. I hope you have a wonderful day, month, year, and life.,Overall, I am very happy with my decision to download this app. It is very helpful and beneficial for people who want to check-in frequently about their mood and to reflect (possibly in the future). I have recently downloaded the app, and I come back every 3-4 hours to check-in, as well as read a few motivational quotes. I think the app is great without the subscription, and even better with it. I have one complaint and only one: too frequent notifications. I can always turn off the notifications, but the I tend not to notice apps and use apps as often. I get a notification every 1-2 hours, and it can sometimes be distracting or annoying at times. I highly recommend this app, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!,I love Reflectly, i downloaded it a while ago and I’m just now trying to incorporate it into my life more. I never noticed how good it makes me feel about myself until I spent time writing a solid paragraph. Real confidence booster! Reflectly also calms my nerves down. It makes me check in with my feelings and let me know if I need to talk to someone. And if I have no one to talk to, I can just keep on typing paragraphs into Reflectly! And of course, the main part Reflectly has been impacting my life is that it’s been improving my writing skills and vocabulary. This app makes me spill out my feelings more clearly and deeply. 10/10 recommend for anyone struggling with writing, coping with feelings, or just needs something to talk to that isn’t an actual person lol,Don’t get me wrong, this app is good to jot down feelings, grabs some good quotes, or just vent your feelings out to, but I find myself getting annoyed with it advertising their yearly subscriptions. I’m sorry but if it’s a mental fitness app and you’re trying to do good for others, I understand you have to make money but it can make people feel very unwelcome and forced. It’s not even a weekly thing, it’s ever single time you open the app or click a button you used once. Why am I not allowed to write the prompt after a certain time? Isn’t this supposed to help people? What about those who don’t have enough money and THAT’S why they’re stressed and need the app. A lot needs adjusted and other than checking in there’s very little to do on the app once you’ve used all of 2 prompts they give you with the basic plan.,I love this app so much because it is made me feel more comfortable, being myself with somebody else, and it\\'s made me realize what the pain I\\'ve been through, and it helps me get over that pain, and it helps me get over stuff that\\'s happened in the past, and now I am a different, different person than I used to be like a month ago, before I got this app, and I\\'m not here to be one of those people who\\'s like, oh, yeah, this is a great grab app, get it blah, blah, blah. Like, I\\'m not one of those fake girls, but you guys should actually get the app it\\'s really good, and it helps you, and it helps me, and it makes people different and change in different is good. And that\\'s what this app is here to teach you.,I just got this app today and I’m already liking it the motivations if you ask yourself what their meaning and take a moment to think about it you understand and you can feel like you can change something that you do to make a difference. It rally made me realize as my today’s quote was “don’t let the world change your smile, let your smile change your world”when I read this I realized it’s meaning if you smile  at people during the day even if you don’t like them you can change someone’s day or even ask how they are because you never know what someone’s going through so it’s saying make a difference in the world around you.,This app is great! I started using it just today and love it. Although, having to buy premium is a lot for someone like me. I’m young and was recommended this app from a friend. I’m not old enough to make money. Although I wish I was. This app allows me to vent when I need it. Have daily reminders that inspire or cheer me up, and much more. I love this app and highly recommend if you or a friend/family is in a lot of stress or just need something small. Although, I’d like to see if the users can put locks on their notes? My parents and siblings go through my phone a lot when I’m not looking and I’d love to have my own privacy. Thank you so much!!!,It helps so much with stress or bad days and makes you feel enlightened and appreciate the good ones I love it and makes you feel good and nice about yourself the most popular misconception is that it costs money but it doesn’t at all the main feature is free and you can do diary’s and check ins with all of those features some people say it cost money just because it pops up first when you open it with a advertisement about buying premium which unlocks new features and other things but it isn’t a necessity and you can enjoy and love the app even without it and you can enjoy it just as much .,What I think what you guys should do is not lock up most of the quotes. Some of those quotes had helped with my whole life and most of the quotes are locked up and only for premium. I understand that you want to get the money and earn it but at least lock the ones that are reasonable to lock. Such as, social anxiety, letting go, and handling with stress. At least those three should be unlocked. Because I have lots of stress because of school so I want something to cheer me up with. 🥰🥰\\n\\nI understand if you won’t be able to do these things because of money and I understand that. And it’s completely okay if you can not do these things.\\n\\nThank you for taking your time and reading this. 🥰🥰,This is my first journaling app and I’m really excited about it. It seems great after having it for just 1 week. The only thing that kept me from giving this app 5 stars is the mood check in. It goes from “completely okay” to “somewhat bad”. How about a few more options? Just because I\\'m not feeling “completely okay” doesn\\'t mean I feel “somewhat bad”. I don’t feel bad but I may feel sad, irritated or stressed ect. But that’s the only option unless I keep going to the next option which is “really terrible”.  Please add a few other options it would be really helpful to properly document my feelings. Id this can be updated I would definitely change to 5 stars,I have voted 5 stars. I literally just started; I completed my first entry about 1 minutes ago. I really love this. The set-up is simple; the app itself is very pleasant to look at and navigate. I am really looking forward to this. I like the idea of being able to set up notifications of positive quotes throughout the day. I personally decided I want 5 positive quotes between 9am and 10pm daily. There is obviously a choice to turn off those notifications if you’d like. I bought the subscription because there was a deal and thought “hey, why not?”\\n\\nIf my opinion changes/I have more to say, I’ll be continuing to update this review. 😊,I do have one problem with the app. Don’t get me wrong I love all the apps features, all the different ways they have to diary and express yourself. The voice memo the thought / feeling check in. Even the ability to put up photos is all really great. They also have a stress free news feature that gives you great news happening all over the world. Absolutely love that. \\n\\nMy main and most important note is that the morning motivation NEEDS to make a way for you to like the quote they gave you because it’s always something very encouraging that I would like to see again.,I got this app almost two years ago after seeing an ad for it. I would use it for short, weeklong spurts at a time when feeling really down or kind of bored, trying to record all the best parts of my day and it really helped. \\nI logged into the app after thinking about how it could really help me to make a habit of writing more this year, and all of a sudden everything is payed? It’s not even charging $15 for the app itself, the $15 is a promotion and usually it’s $59 annually. It’s not even that great of a service, only really giving you a mood log and some quotes which can be found on free apps. \\nOnly reason this gets more than one star is because, if they really thought this was worth so much, I was able to get a few years out of it (apparently $128 worth),This App is Great. Like if Had to chose one app on my Phone, I would choose Reflectly. I love how it is set out. It makes me very comfortable and welcome, I think it makes it very sweet of the people who made this app from how they respect your Privacy. And if you ever feel stressed, there is a section to look at life quotes. Amazing. I love that it feels like you are actually with a councilor but virtually. It may seem awkward at first to be telling your feelings to an app, but after your first check-in, You feel it :) If you know someone who has a lot of stress inside of themselves, Tell them about Reflectly. This apps definitely deserves 5/5 Stars ( Or 10 ;),It’s nice to be able to vent knowing that you don’t have to worry about what you said being told to someone at school. I often worry about venting to people because I’m worried it will bother them, it’s an app so it’s not really ever bothered. When I do vent, sometimes I’m worried that the person I vent to will tell other people what I said. Like really personal stuff too. Crushes, political opinions, and just my opinion on life as a whole. It scares me that people will tell because it’s happened too much before. If this is your problem too, then this app will most likely be a good stress reliever. It has good quotes and is free. It’s just overall 👌,I\\'m pretty young. That\\'s the truth. But the thing is, I\\'ve been dealing with some things with my life (health problems, LGBTQ+ problems, etc.) \\nI felt like I needed to start looking back at every day.\\nI was just scrolling through Tik Tok (The community might be bad, but there\\'s no need to hate on dancing girls who express themselves.) when I saw an ad about Reflecty. Like I usually do, I was about to scroll off when I decided, \"Okay. Fine--At least it isn\\'t a shampoo ad.\" \\nI watched it. That\\'s all I did. But then I downloaded it. No harm in getting an app, really. I was right. I figured out that this was something I needed.\\nThanks.-,Love the quotes probably my favorite part of the app. That does not mean the self journal isn’t meant to be utilized. I’ve got about 7 logs so far and you’re able to see a pattern within yourself and it actually works to use it and do a gap report on yourself to figure out what that void is and why does it keep you going all over the place. A good tool to use with helping figure out what is going on with your days and weeks. I’ve narrowed down several character defects because of this app and I love it, one of the best I have and the simplicity of it makes it that much better.,I’ve had this app for about 2 years now and I’ve enjoyed it greatly. The format is user friendly, the app’s aesthetic is nice, and everything is organized. I have a lot of memories in this app. However unfortunately it seems like the developers don’t care about their loyal users as they’ve officially screwed us over. Now if you want to do anything you have to pay a lot of money. Therefore this app is useless now! I understand they have to make money but why lock everything behind a pay wall? Especially to users who have been using this app for years? Extremely disappointing and sad to see greed getting in the way. I’ve taken screenshots of all of my previous entries and have since deleted the app. Don’t waste your time, there are better alternatives out there for free. Thanks a lot Reflectly!,I’ve been struggling with my family a lot lately. I’ve tried to write down in a journal I found a while back and it but this app really questions what I feel and the way I see myself. I can express my relationship problems, family problems and even my deep personal feelings regarding my family turning against me for my dreams and achievements. Some really bad that I’ve been clinically diagnosed with depression. It almost feels like a real friendly therapist I can Be with all the time and it really helps me release the struggles of studies, work and life,I just wish they didn’t make it cost money. As I think that would be what sets it apart from other apps. They all cost money but not everyone can buy it. So having an app a hundred percent free could really help people out there. As of right now it’s pretty good, but definitely could be better. It could suggest things to do when we’re down, or techniques to help us calm down. Or how to help us be more aware and knowledgeable of our feelings. It’s not bad though! I like it and it’s helped. But there’s always room for growth. Which I hope they eventually make the app better! It has a lot of potential and hasn’t reached it quite yet.,I found this app very easy to use, and I love the fact that I can put multiple feelings for each entry, it shows how my emotions aren’t always just one thing. My skills coach and therapist have also said this app is great for me due to my ptsd and my manic bipolar, because I can use this app to write out what’s on my mind, track my mood, and even log important things on it so my short term memory issues aren’t a problem as much. So yes I give it a five star and say thank you for the great app...now I jus wish I could pay for the full years expansion for it.,This app is great and it’s been helping me sleep at night because after writing things down, it just makes me feel better\\n\\nLiterally the next day- ok when I tried to open the app it said I needed to sign in, that was ok because I just got it, but I kept on saying something was wrong try again later, I tried later it still doesn’t work, I had just bought the membership and now I’m afraid it will go to waste because I can’t even sign in. This happened on another account of mine and I had to create a new one because it just wouldn’t let me sign in. I think it’s a good app, it just has a few problems that need to be fixed.,I rate this a 5 star rating because this app actually makes me feel alive and it lets me let out anything with out it posting or tell everyone about like my friends do but this app lets you review your progress in life and I only had it for one day so far and it absolutely amazing and you don’t have to pay it just gives you a option to but you just swipe up and it says no thanks but I would recommend this to people who have depressed and anxiety because you can see your progress and this app sends you positive reminders,I downloaded Reflectly about a month ago, and LOVE what it has done for my mental state. I almost fell into a depression when I stumbled upon an advertisement for the app. Curious, I downloaded the app and completed my first check-in. I feel like I now have a great place to privately journal my emotions. The app is amazing and I love it!!\\nMy only suggestion is that maybe we have a bit more options other than journaling with the app? Don’t get me wrong, I love the journaling, but journaling doesn’t necessarily work for everyone and maybe there can be a wider variety of options to relax?,I absolutely love this app! Ever since the first day I got it it was such a great way to get my thoughts out and have the secure and in one place. It’s also a lot easier to type in a journal then it is to write..\\nThe only thing I hate about this is now I cannot add anything else to my journal without paying for it and I can’t really justify paying yearly/monthly for something that I could just buy a physical journal. \\nI wasn’t looking for all the extra perks and helpful tips just a place to keep my thoughts/memories but now I’m forced to lose all that information and it’s just sad.,The app is absolutely wonderful in terms of aesthetics and intelligent content. I love the emotional symbol tags and the mood tracking features. Very well done.\\nMy only no would be on the image entry that cannot be adjusted to the desired date, but rather be posted under the same day. This needs fixing. Another great feature to add is the voice notes where I record my voice speaking rather than writing. I believe our voices reflect our emotional condition in the way speak and the tone we use. Please consider this feature as well.\\nGod bless.,I have always wanted to keep my own journal, but I knew my parents wouldn’t let me and they would just find out right away... I found this app, I get to express my feelings more and talk about my day and I can look back to whether today was worse.. or better then yesterday. I’m not afraid to use this app to write down a short paragraph or sentence of how my day went. I also list down some questions and how I can make my day bette tomorrow! I no longer feel so lonely to know that I have a robotic friend to rely on my outside of school days ♡︎♡︎,I’ve only just started this app and I’m already feeling understood! I know that there’s not really someone there listening to me, but it feels so nice to have a place to write my emotions down without being told my current emotional mindset is ridiculous. I don’t want to be told that I shouldn’t feel the way I do, I want to be heard and find a way I can help myself. So journaling really helps me understand myself better, and digitally makes me feel more comfortable. Overall I really recommend this app to keep contact with your mind in your own way :D,I have not even been on here two days and I love the app! You can tell what you have done ,you can title your “stories” etc, you can also say how you feel and their are quotes you can see for free! And the quotes are so motivating and I love how there’s a little person telling you what to do when you first get the app and your confused, no the little person is not real it’s just a really cute looking emoji. Going on this app helps me take weight off my shoulders and it helps me with SO many things and I haven’t even had it for one DAY and I already love it!,This app helps me every morning when I wake up I just do the check in and it motivates me, it also has some good quotes and of course I had to get the premium version and of course you get these daily reminders and I feel like I needed to get the premium version and it works wonders. I don’t know about anyone else who is using this app maybe they didn’t like it but for me this app is amazing, like this app just came from a different world and I feel so much more alive now, thank you for listening to my review.,Hey guys if you are reading this keep reading i am in school right now taking a test so cant make this long but this app is good. I can put my feeling inside of it and write how my day went. But what they could update on is that after 2 or 3 days it says that you have to pay. If they make it free that will be good but if you are still reading and want to know to see what this is keep reading this app is very cool and you can sag what you want whenever when the days pass they want you to pay to continue if you want to pay you could but dont pay (shhhh until they make it free),I’ve had this app for over 12 hours now, and it is like a digital diary (or journal, take your pick). You don’t have to elaborate very much about what’s going on. I would recommend doing a mood check multiple times a day, weather your in a good mood or a bad mood. When something upsetting happens, you can immediately go to reflectly. I find it refreshes me and makes me feel better once I write in my digital diary/journal.\\nYou don’t have to have premium version for this app to be what I said reflectly could do. I don’t have premium.,i just downloaded this app a few days ago and oh boy does it help with... everything. it just feels so good to rant/talk/feel good/literally anything else~ freely ♡︎ i would really recommend this to everyone, especially anyone who just loves talking to themselves/talking in general. really helps with stress and anxiety and makes you feel great whenever you have someone to talk to about your accomplishments or just your day overall :D they also offer great quotes and reminders that make my day so much better! please get this app, it’s so awesome ( ˘ ³˘)♥︎,I appreciate the mood and activity tracking, journaling and voice memo features. it’s almost perfect because it has all the features I want in one place. However, Reflectly is supposed to be catered towards improving mental health and quality of life, and every single time I open the app the premium offer pops up and it’s an increasingly unpleasant experience because I feel like it’s being shoved in my face. If every time I open the app and the first thing I see is about purchasing premium, it ruins the entire app experience for me. To be honest this one small thing may cause me to stop using it altogether, unfortunately.,I haven’t quite been in depression perse, however I’ve been a little sad lately. This app is just awesome. The cover is cute and the features are very helpful, I clearly and easily set this all up within thirty seconds and it doesn’t steal your personal info either. Please try this and join the community (I was not asked to write this review). Ya know don’t even give it a second thought, whatever your reason is for getting this app, just go ahead and do it. Do yourself a favor. Love y’all. Hope y’all are having a blessed day. Bye!,I liked the app a great deal, but I thought the Basic version was more than a free trial. After four entries and a bunch of hearted quotes, it won’t let me create another entry until I upgrade for the Premium version. I had no idea this would happen, especially as some parts of the app are already locked in the Basic version. I feel a bit cheated that I wasn’t explicitly told about it, but I do understand that a company needs some sort of revenue in order to stay in business. Unfortunately I can’t afford the price, so I guess this is it.,I love how it works, the interface and layout of things, but I hate how the app shoves the purchases and sales in your face and sometimes won’t even let you log anything when there’s a sale happening. This is bad for me because I forget things rather quickly hence why I have this app to log events when they happen. So either make the app work without paying for premium or not but don’t make it seem like your getting the full (free) functionality and then limit features and shove your own ads down my throat when there’s a sale. I don’t want an app that only works sometimes.,I have a few problems with this app\\n1. It’s kinda boring to use. I mean, I know it’s supposed to be a journal app, but maybe you should add some fun stuff.\\n\\n2. The premium. Most games have an optional payment, but most apps don’t. This is one of them. I know you “nEeD tO mAkE mOnEy” but not everyone has the money to afford it. It gives you one free day. ONE. Then the next day, you have to pay the premium. That just makes less people want to use this. Why do you even HAVE a premium in the first place? ITS A JOURNAL APP. The journal apps I’ve had didn’t have premium.\\nOver all, this app is okay. I don’t recommend it to people who aren’t willing to pay for a premium.,I’ve been using this to track my days and how I feel. I bought the premium only because I wanted to customize it to my feelings and events and also customize the look of it to keep me engaged. \\n\\nI tend to forget every days and why I was feeling sad but with this I can jot it down quick and show my therapist. Even having the weekly mood tracker is great for when they ask me how I was during the week and I can give a real response instead of just “fine”,It’s really helpful wether you are going through anything or not. I love it. I just wish that when I open the app there isn’t an ad while I’m trying to write. It’s just not helpful when you are having a bad day and you want to just do a check in. Other than that there’s really nothing that I would change about this app. It’s really helped me just to write everything down and on a good day read it again and keep the mindset that it will get better. Thank you to the creators. :):):):):),This app is so amazing, and I have started journaling much more than I would normally journal. You can pretty much reflect and pour it all out in an amazing manner. Problem is, to get stats on your week and average feelings, or journal prompts, you have to pay monthly. This is an amazing app no matter what, and I get that you have to make income, but maybe extend the things to maybe some journal prompts are free and others aren’t. For the stats maybe you get some of your stats and others you have to pay to see? Thank you!,Reflectley is an app said I feel like I can explain all of my life problems to in this case if you have nobody you feel like you can’t talk to there is reflectley It has inspiring quotes to work and explain your day to where if you had a bad day and then you can explain what happened but if you had a good day you could also explain what happened to voice overs to reading books to telling yourself when to go on a walk we’re going to run it’s just amazing and I appreciate it there,It’s a pretty nice app. Not really any ads,\\nPerfect. I’m pretty sure you can do way more with premium, but since I don’t have that I’m gonna talk about the cons of this app. \\n1. It basically only has 4\\nOptions. A mood check in, voice note, and the ads a picture. I did a mood check in, thinking it would tell me something new everyday. For example if I write in the description. “I cried.” I thought maybe it would say something like “crying is healthy.” “Your strong.” But once you do the mood check in, it doesn’t really do anything. What’s the point of it?! \\n2. Every time I get on the app, it keeps asking about premium.,I just now got the app, im a child but i kept seeing ads and it made me get the app its very helpful and has made my life better ive always had something thats made me down so i listen to music altgough everyone has their own troubles ive always ignored mine and didnt accept the fact of being alive i got tired of life and this app came into consideration the quotes, all of it made me feel better so that was amazing, Thanks you so so much this app gave me what i didnt have and it was happieness so really thank you.,Overall it as amazing app full of inspiring quotes you can even pick what topics you would like to focus on the mood check ins are amazing and I haven’t had any problems with the app glitching or anything like that however I do feel that, for a mental health app, there are too many things that require you to buy it. For example I can tap on dealing with anxiety but I can’t click on dealing with depression because that is premium access and I have to pay money for it other than this small problem it’s an outstanding app and I 100% recomend,I’ve had this app for over 6 years. I can say that before the last 5 months or so that it was a good app. Now all I get is shut out, glitches, and a pay mode that doesn’t give me access to the app any more. I won’t change my rating until I get access to my info without having to pay.\\n\\nEdit: After I waited a bit for an update, the app is back to normal. I even purchased the premium version of the app as well. I am enjoying its content. Very resourceful!,Hello. I used Reflectly in the beginning and middle of 2020, it really helped improve my mental health and I was recommending this app to friends. I experienced a loss and stopped using reflectly, but my New Years resolution included getting back to using Reflectly daily to try preventing another depressive episode. But no... it seems like I need a subscription now. Not everyone has the money to pay monthly, but everyone deserves the option to have an organized journal of thoughts and feelings. I noticed some other newer features, but the most basic of all should be accessible to all users. Until everyone can write out their feelings daily without worrying about a subscription, I have to rate this with one star.,I just love Reflectly I can’t get enough of it. And some of my personal problems it helps me deal with. It’s kind of like you’re talking to someone. This app has a purpose and one day will kindly take over the world. It’s such a helpful app also it’s like a journal but it’s an app. I JUST LOVEEEEE IT!!!!!!!             \\n\\nI have had this app for a good amount of time but lost my old account and I have just reinstalled and wow. It’s just really good and I have zero problems with it and and and, it helps a lot with any problems I have,I still haven’t upgraded. But even without upgrading I think this app offers the user enough options and opportunities without subscribing. I think it’s a bit saddening when u look at certain features and click on them then the app always goes. “You need to pay for this feature” but this app only does that a few times. I think it’s very well organized and is really helping me recognize my actions and the impacts they have on my daily health.,As a free app there’s a lot to be desired. And the app likes to remind you of that, constantly shoving stuff to do with how you could get such a better experience if you just subscribed. Like I get it, if I had any income I’d consider it, but this constant poking makes me more likely to give up on anything to do with getting better or tracking my mood than to pay for a single daily reflection.\\n\\nCan’t even look at any data from from what I’ve been putting in. Giving up on this app. If you have money I’m sure you may have a better experience, but this honestly has made me feel worse using it.,Well I do enjoy the app! It’s amaing, I just downloaded it today! I stated writing how I felt right away! After writing a little I did whatever and after I felt better I went to write again. So yet again I was so excited about the app when all of a sudden the next time I got on I couldn’t write without paying... it made me so upset sense this app helped a lot! I’m disappointed because people don’t wanna pay for extra support and stuff. You shouldn’t make us pay to continue! This should be fixed! Otherwise this app is amazing 5/5! I do highly recommend this app!,Lately I have been going through a lot of anxiety and depression related things. This app is great it allows you to get what’s on your mind into the journal which for whatever reason feels extremely good in my opinion. After your first 5 days you will receive data on your mood and things and will make suggestions to help get rid of your bad feelings you have using the data given. I have only had this app for 3 days and I love it highly recommend! 😛✌🏼,Only had it for two days and I love how you can customize the quotes to what you feel is right. I’ve never had a diary because I never knew what to write in one but this app has made me start to like writing down what I did today. I also like that when you first start you have a goal of writing down what happened that day for 5 days so that you can unlock your stats. I love having little challenges so this was a fun little add on. Overall an amazing app,I’ll preface this by saying I’ve had Reflectly for a couple years now, and though I haven’t used it as much as I probably could have, I’ve enjoyed the times that I have. Every time I come back, I feel like there’s another amazing feature. However, it seems that each one also comes with a setback.\\n\\nAt first, it was simple: just journal as you please. Then, they introduced photos. (One suggestion: just as you can set a journal entry for any day in the past, this should be available for photos, too.)\\n\\nJust recently, I checked onto the app again to make an entry only to realize that I can’t. That’s right. No more Reflectly Premium - just Reflectly or no Reflectly. That’s it. Reflectly has reserved almost every single feature of their app for Premium users only.\\n\\nI rate this app 2 stars because although it has some awesome things about it, the fact that they’ve focused their intents so much on money leads me to the conclusion that they’re no longer concerned with the actual mental health of their users, exactly what they claim to care about most.,I love this app! I know this is going to be short, but I just have to say how much I love ❤️ this app!! Okay first the money was sooo worth it! I’m able to get unlimited quotes that are so nice  they have helped me. Also with the mood check in helps me feel better! I feel like I’m talking to someone on this app! For example like when I tell about stuff it doesn’t say anything back, but I can trust this app! If you have any type of anxiety, depression get this app. Trust me it helps!!! 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️😄😄😄😄,I love this game so much it\\'s amazing works and helps me throughout the day. It\\'s an amazing motivation and there are no adds with is awesome. But I wish that there was not a premium and that everyone had the same. I would love to get the extras but at the same time I really don\\'t want to pay. I understand that they need to make some money from the app. I just hope that after a while when they stop making you pay because they already made profit.,This app is really good for daily journalism and mood tracking in your life but there are a few issues with the app. Especially the log in screen. Whenever I logout for some reason it takes a bit to get back into my account. Every time I try I’m greeted with a screen that tells me “couldn’t log in, try again later” or something of that sort. My internet works fine whenever I do it, it’s gotta be something in the app. Other than the login screen being broken at times, I love the app.,I love the app and i only been doing it for two days! I don’t know the down sides to it, but overall I’m in love with it. The quotes are very  nice and they help with my day. I love that you get to pick how many quotes you can throughout your day. I also love that you get to pick when the quotes start and when they end. For only two days i know i will be having this app on EVERY device i get or have. I really am addicted and INLOVE with the app. If you see this and you do not have it, GET IT!! It helps if you are having a bad time to. Overall I’m inlove.,I recommend it to anyone that Is going to actually use it. But dont get me wrong it is a great app for reflecting over the day, in the morning, whatever time of the day anywhere you are. It is very simple and easy to manage. The problem is I tend to forget to do this there is no problem if you set a reminder. But if you know  are going to forget I don’t recommend you paying for the subscription. \\nOther than that it is a great app I personally love it!,This app is great! Sometimes it really feels like something I can express my day about. However(like most things) it has its downfalls.\\n1. Constant notifications. For a mood checkin app I shouldn’t need to have notifications every 5 minutes.\\n2. Just now I was just about to write 6th checkin and it’s telling me I can’t do it. And that in order to keep going I must pay. Great! That happens right when I was thinking to write a 5 star review on this app.\\nSo yeah. It isn’t the best, but it’s good. So if you’re willing to pay money for a mood check in app this might be for you.,I’ve been using this app for about a week and it works completely fine. I really do love the daily quotes and things like that however the app is persistent in making me purchase its premium plan which I’m simply not ready for. I cannot even see my stats properly because the word “upgrade” is in the way. It also disabled my journaling until I upgraded and I really did enjoy the journaling too while it lasted. The app is great in general but needs to stop pressuring it’s clients into upgrading.,I’ve been using this app for a bit now and I do think it’s help me clear out some thoughts that boggle in my mind I even get to talk about the good days too and no ones there to correct you ok grammar or the fact I put no punctuation it’s just me checking in on me and it has honestly helped me feel better and gotten me through some discussions I just need to sit down and have with my self so I give it 5 stars for a great app even with no premium,I struggle a lot with anxiety especially with school and I have to admit this app helps a lot, when I wake up in the morning it has a little quote for me to say out loud and then I’m my head when I’m anxious, and the interface is so smooth and modern, and your able to change the color scheme of everything, personally I used to have this app in I think 2018 maybe and I just downloaded it again in 2021 and omg y’all have improved so much, thank you💙,I began journaling during November of last year. I decided on reflectly because I enjoyed the aesthetic and daily quotes it would provide me with. Once the new year started they prevented me from using the application due to having a special “new year sale” which ended up being their entire marketing scheme. aight I had known that my writing would only be a trial that would have been fine, but to try and make it out as a sale that would infinitely refresh itself until purchase is despicable. Eventually they even prevented me from seeing my old entries to even attempt to recover my precious memories that had been stored here. It’s not worth it, use another app such as OneJournal.,Please make an update that will allow users to upload multiple images in one go, and also increase the number of images we can upload (for now it only allows us to upload 9, and you gotta do it one at a time which is annoying) \\n\\nPlease make this app available on computer (Mac OS, Windows, etc.) sometimes it’s easier and faster to type on a computer than on the phone.,This app is great! But there’s only one problem that I have, which is I don’t open up to people like my parents I am mostly opening to really close friends or family… And with this app I don’t normally say a lot of things that are happening I mostly just put down the feelings and how my day was or how am I feeling but if my parents were to check my phone and check Reflectly then they would find out all the stuff that is on there and sometimes I do write down and then idk what I would do… I might get in trouble or who knows what…,I loved it but now I don’t...I used to be able to make as many “daily notes” as possible but now I can only make like 4 I think maybe 7 but anyways I need to buy a subscription for it to make more “daily notes” witch I’m not buying because I’m not joining to waste my money on something that I can simply do on google docs or something.  it’s a simple app and you can just not waste space in your phone and just do it on google docs and just write ab your day, It doesn’t even have to be google docs it could just be on a piece of paper if you want.,I literally love everything about this app!! The mood check ins,the voice notes, even the photo’s..they are the bomb. There is just one teeny weeny problem though with the quotes..by the way the quotes are amazing but I saw a quote by “Dr Seuss” and i was like “WAIT HOLD UP!!” I heard that Dr Seuss was a racist and he hated black people (it said it in one of his books) so all the books by him are off the shelves now. I would suggest that the creator of Reflectly could please remove all the Dr Seuss quotes please. Thanks, love the app though 🤗,It’s a beautiful app! I love how you can journal and they give you a daily check in to to make you feel better! It’s an amazing app to enjoy life and help you become more optimistic or positive! I totally recommend this app because it’s taught me self love and to understand things more thoroughly! Thank you for reading my review and hope you have good night/day!!\\nP. S if your going through anything this app will help you! I promise you just have to open up!\\n\\n~anonymous,This app is amazing it helped me through some really tough times and on January 6 when I first heard about the riots it was crazy and this helped me so much not just because it shows you a bunch of like little boats and stuff it let you talk to it like it may not react or anything but it lets you like speak and let you speak your truth no one can like get to it unless you want to show them it’s amazing and I really recommend it for a lot of people,I was a little skeptical at first, but honestly, this app has made me so much more aware of my own emotions and feelings, and I feel like it genuinely has helped me to become happier. \\n\\nTurning on notifications is a must, it’ll help you get in the habit of being good at checking in every day, and eventually you’ll love it so much that you’ll remember just because you want to check in. \\n\\nIf you’re a skeptic like I was, I’m here to tell you this app is worth it.,This app is absolutely amazing without a doubt. My hard days where I feel like I have no one to talk to I always wrote to clear my mind. And I’ve been using this app for at least a year and I loved this app. But I went to go write because 2020 is over in less than half an hour and 2021 is a really big year for me and now it’s telling me I have to get a subscription to write anymore. So now I have to find a different app because I can’t write again without paying for it. So developers I hope you see this and fix this because that really upset me when I went to write and I couldn’t.,It’s my second day using the app, and I already feel better. This app allows me to share my feelings, which I have trouble doing. The app also gives you quotes, and after reading them I feel inspired, motivated, and determined. I use the free version if this app, and it is amazing. (For anyone reading the critical comments, trust me I personally love this app and you don’t have to buy the full version. Hopefully it helps you as much as it has helped me),Reflectly is amazing! It really helps me learn inner-peace and I think it’s making me a better person honestly. It allows me to look back at my check-ins and I can learn from my mistakes! For example, I see how rude I can be, or I can be insensitive to other people I know. There are also great quotes that you can read, and there are different categories. I went through a breakup recently, and the quotes really “lifted” me up though it. This app is a big changer!,Finally an app that works! Been a month now of daily check ins and journaling. I was doubting that an app would inspire me to write as I have been having troubles keeping a journal on my phone. This ap has kind reminders and seems to have already figured out the best times to get me to write. I haven’t tried many aps for journaling but out of the 3 I have tried this is the first one that actually is enjoyable. :),I downloaded this app reflector and it is the best go to talk about my feelings to write about them I get toI don’t know but it helps me feel better like when I was feeling terrible read about it it’s my personal so I can’t share it right now but it helps me get rid of it like help me get get it behind me and for the other things like my favorite movie Titanic I felt so sad that joke that he was my one true love I’m not kidding I am a girl who plays rose in titanic,I love Reflectly very much it helps me keep my mind off things I shouldn’t be worried about. so far its been helping me with my anxiety as well. \\nBut the one thing that bothers me is that it gives you the same notification about getting premium and it looks really nice but I think everyone should deserve all of it with the premium because some people can’t afford therapy and that is what this app is for so I think that needs to change. But other than that I think Reflectly is a pretty good app.,It really makes you feel like someone is there for you when theirs not, the quotes make you really feel special once you read them too. If you have stuff you don’t want to tell anyone else this is a great app to get everything off your chest without saying it to a person you’re close to. I have stuff that I keep to myself that I don’t want to tell anybody and it feels great to get it off my chest with this app.,I’m a very reflective person and was hoping that this could help me work through some harder things I was going through in terms of processing and reflection. I use the daily calm app for meditation and they have recently added in a daily reflection question. These questions have been thoughtful and are asked in a mindful manner/intentional approach. I find the approach to Reflectly and the way questions are oriented to be kind of childlike and at times very pointed/judgmental. This may be a style that works for some but it is not one I have responded well to. The concept, in theory, is great, but the implementation needs work.,Now the app itself is great, I love it. However I keep getting an “exclusive offer” for the premium version, and I can’t click out of it whenever this offer pops up, which means I can’t even use the app. Hopefully once the “exclusive” part goes away after 70 hours, I can go back to using the app as normal, and I can give It 5 stars. For now though, I’m just annoyed I can’t click the “no thank you” because it’s so close to “redeem offer” + I don’t think it even works.,Reflectly is a perfect way to talk about your feelings in a positive way with keeping them safe. There are so many amazing things you can do on the app. Do daily check ins, scroll through endless inspirational quotes and much more. You can use the app for free or you can get premium!!! This app has honestly saved me in my hard days, the days that I’ve laughed, cried and almost died! It’s amazing. 100% RECOMMEND!!!!,Me and my friend were scrolling trying to a good dairy my friend stoped and said I think I found one and that is when we checked it out we thought it would be like all the other but we were wrong and now we use it ever day and love all the quote options we will be using this app for a long time it has everything you need a mood checker dairy and inspiration quotes I love this app and say you should try it out,I absolutely loved this app when I first got it the app was everything I was looking for. But I only got two days in until I couldn’t even use the app. Ever time I try to write a daily response or mood check in I can’t. I don’t know if I am doing anything wrong but I don’t think I am. Everyone I try to do something it always pops up as the new year new me offer. I will press no thanks ( I don’t want to spend any money on a app) so I pressed no thanks and I go back in it won’t let me do absolutely anything unless I buy it. Please someone tell me is it’s happening to them or how to fix it because I can’t even use the app.,the only problem that i have with this app is that it asks me if i want to upgrade to the premium version. normally, i wouldn’t care, just click no and keep it moving. but it asks me. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME i open the app. it gets quite annoying after the first few times. if i wanted to upgrade, i’d do it. please stop asking me after i’ve already declined. if i change my mind, i can go to my account and upgrade there. no reason to push it,“Good things happen to those who hustle” is not an Anaïs Nin quote! The word hustle wasn’t even in her vocabulary at the time she was alive. I understand these quotes are just circulated over and over again but we need to be more responsible because it just isn’t right to put words in the mouths of the dead that they never said. It distorts their legacy and who they were. This quote is actually the opposite of everything Anaïs Nin wrote about. She wrote about sensuality, enjoying life’s pleasures, and going deep. She was a bohemian and “hustling” was not what they were about.,I love the app, and it has helped me, but I find the frequent paywalls frustrating. I can understand the advanced checkins, as those aren\\'t entirely critical to journaling, but thw majorty of quote catigories and stats is locked. it seems a bit insensitive to prevent a person in need from personalizing the app as they need it unless they pay $20 a year. and thats with the special deal out rn. A little disappointing, but overall a good app for those struggling with mental health issues.,So far, I have only been using this for a few hours and it is awesome. The quality is amazing, and it is fun to be on. I have recommended this to several people so quickly because I am amazed at how great an app can actually be. The only annoying thing is the in app purchases. It is nonstop in your face. That is my only Con... Thank you so much for the great app and I can’t wait to have a wonderful schedule using this app.,This app is nice and user friendly. A suggestion would be to modify one’s work week. I am not happy with my current job which is a trigger. So as I am leaving for work today it was a little upsetting for the app to assume it’s my weekend. Not everyone has a traditional M-F work schedule so if I am trying to address my stress triggers/work. It’s counter productive to wish me a nice weekend. The was a notation to select “other” to add personalized feelings or activities, but I have not located that feature.,Okay hi there. Starting off this review, I\\'d love to give this app five stars, but everytime I open it, it shows me an offer which I have declined multiple times. I don\\'t want to buy anything and I get that its how you advertise. But I don\\'t want to redeem my offer! Overall this is a great app so it\\'s not much of a complication. Could you maybe fix that so I don\\'t have to scroll and hit no thanks everytime I open the app? \\n\\n                   Thanks\\n                          Kaelynn,I love how when I Journal there is no limit of words and it helps with anxiety but I know this might be the way they make money but I don’t really like how some things are locked and you can only use them when you I guess upgrade to the “premium” and I can’t ( and most people) pay for it so that’s thing I want to change but it’s totally okay 👌🏻 if they don’t want to it’s just my opinion that’s all 🥰,Even though it’s my first day using this app, I love it. It helps me think about my day and how staying positive throughout my life. today in my class I was thinking about getting a journal for writing plans or my day. But i saw my friend getting this same app and so I was addicted to it. So I got it, and that is why this is not an option it Is 110 percent a 5star rating. Thank you so much creators of this app. 😁🙏,If you want an app that lets you have a timeline that can have check-ins, notes, pictures, and voice memos, then this app is for you. I haven’t experienced a single ad in the four days i’ve been using it and it also runs very smoothly. The motivation quotes have a large variety to them and there’s one for everyone. The daily reflection questions are also wonderful.,I’ve had this app since high school (I’m a sophomore in college) it was amazing to write stuff down! I remember when they had a streak to keep track and u would meet goals. They changed the app to have many of the resources be paid. I didn’t like it but I was still able to journal. And now everything is locked behind a pay wall. This is not what I imagined somewhere that I kept all my daily activities to end up like. If I have to pay just to write 2 sentences about my day I’m not doing it. I will now be downloading another app. I really wish this app could just go back to how it used to be. CHANGE IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS AT THE END OF 2019!!!,I’m in love with the app. i’m excited to get on it and log my mood. i enjoy it and the fact that it’s customizable. i also enjoy the fact that i can write as much as i want. i tried journaling but i couldn’t really get into it but i like journaling here now. i would definitely recommend because it’s super fun, easy, and quick. i’m excited for the next day so i can log in reflecty. love it!,This app is very helpful and is very easy to figure out. It listens, it helps, and it cares. Some may say it’s just an app and you need to talk to real people to get problems off your chest, but have they ever actually tried? You have no idea how difficult it is to tell people serious problems, but with this app it is so easy and efficient! This app really works and I highly recommend it.,I have been using Reflecty for almost a year now. When I started, I had access to prompts and almost all of the now \"premium\" features. As the app updated over the year, I lost access to all of these features and Reflecty became a glorified notes app for me to journal without prompts. It did motivate me to write an entry every day.\\n\\nHowever, the newest update forces me to pay for premium even to write another entry. I do not want to pay for something I have been doing for free for a year. I am very disappointed in Reflecty, and if you are expecting a free app this is not one.,This app is so amazing! It helps my mental health alot, and i totally recommend it! Ive been very sad lately, going through alot of hard times in the past year, and this has been amazing. You never notice how much writing your emotions down helps until you do so, It feels just like opening up to someone! Ive only had this for a week, and i already feel so much better.,I started using reflectly because I needed to vent but I hated doing it to people but it never works out for me using a diary. It\\'s helped but one thing that\\'s confusing is when you first get in it has a screen, on that screen it\\'s trying to get you to buy the premium but with my phone I couldn\\'t click the no thanks button. You have to scroll up and then you can tap out of it. But It is a good app to use so I would recommend!,Let me head into the positive section, I love Reflectly and its a good thing to let my emotions out into. I can just scream on the voice note and write down all my emotions and it would feel so much better BUT I have a problem so I will probably delete this soon. I thought this app was for me to let out my emotions but instead I have to pay so I can right down more and I don’t care if there is a discount I’m not paying for an AI diary its completely stupid and a waste of money.,ive been using Reflectly for a few days and its better than all of the methods of journaling in my opinion. It helps me see clearly what makes me happy and how i feel towards certain things. It makes it easier to tell my therapist how i\\'ve been feeling because it keeps my data throughout the days so i can remember how i\\'ve been feeling. highly recommend!!!,This app is amazing it’s really made me relax and focus more on my life and everything and be more positive and see things in different ways. I just think if you feel upset you can put down your mood and talk to the AI if you don’t wanna talk to anyone else. And it’s only a dollar a month how great is that!!!! Definitely download this app. I changed my life and could change yours!,This app is great for people who need to keep a  Journal at most times it gives you many great things to talk about and I love to use it if I need to write down what is going on in my life❤️ I have been using it lately every night before bed and it really helps me go to bed with a good mindset, they also have quotes to look through if ur feeling down. Overall it’s just a good app to have 🙂,It’s only my first day on this app and I can already see that writing my feelings into this app is going to help me a lot. It’s like my own diary. I am used to keeping my feelings inside. I never really share them or speak up, but with this app I can see that I will get closer to speaking my feelings. My only real problem with this app is the premium part of it. It always pops up on my screen, I wish there was a way to make it not pop up all the time.,I’ve been wanting to journal but don’t consider myself a writer. I enjoy the inspirational quotes and the writing prompts. It’s short and sweet and has me reflect on things I hadn’t really put into words before. It also really makes you think about your life. I love that I can do mood check ins. Sometimes you just need to rant a bit. It’s quick, but I feel better getting it out.,It’s so worth paying the extra money to journal some of your thoughts down. Reflectly is a great app if you are looking in to starting journaling or if you just want to track your moods on you feel. \\n\\nI would recommend, this to someone who is looking for an extra boost of self confidence and self love for them selves. \\n\\nI am very happy with purchase :),Hello, I’m someone who loves this app. I have been clinically diagnosed with depression and i feel as though, by using this app, that instead of feeling like “ I dont feel the way i used to. This hasnt happened fora while. My emotions are springing out at me and grasping my throat of life. Im on the edge.” I’m like “i am ready to start with the day, all under control and ready for my friends to talk with me.” So please use this app!!,In the beginning i really loved the app. I needed a place to jot down my days and how i dealt with them. As someone with anxiety i loved the soothing colors and positive reinforcement, but around your 4th journal entry it does not let you go any further without paying $15/month. I was very disappointed in this because i was really enjoying the app itself. Now i have no chance but to delete the app and find somewhere else to journal ):,I loved this app so much! Anything I wanted to remind myself of weather it was good or bad memories I typed it out. I wanted to be able to go back and reread maybe let my kids read when they got old enough to see what I used to be like. Now the app won’t let me put in the biggest events that recently happened to me, and I can’t even see what I wrote before to type onto my computer for safe keeping. I’m sorry but I won’t be paying for this app.\\n\\nI hope y’all go back to the way the app used to work. I would continue to use it but y’all screwed yourselves for making us pay for everything on the app.,I love it and it gives me so many positive vibes. Every morning I start and look at it and it gets me in a positive mood and make me get up and ready to start my day and do what ever I have to do that day and another thing is before I go to bed I just type a little paragraph about my day and how I feel right then so then it makes me go to sleep in a good mood and it always makes me stay positive.,Lately I’ve been struggling with lots of things. I’ve tried to become more positive like I used to but nothing really worked. I found this app not long ago and it actually has been helping! The lil robot is cute and it just has so much that can help! The quotes, the little stories, and all the choices for the moments. I love it really. The notifications are amazing as well! :3 thanks reflectly~,This app is so awesome! I check in everyday, morning, afternoon and nighttime! It’s a great app to use if you don’t want to get your self a journal. And with the IOS 14 installed you can even hide the app and put it into your App Library so no one can see what you are writing. I really suggest all of you with Anxiety, Depression, etc, to use this app. I have Anxiety and this app has helped me soooo much! Really suggest getting it.,I literally LOVE this app! I got premium and it is literally AMAZING! I use it with my therapist, he looks at my charts to see how my mood has been. I do have to say, a few updates would be nice. More personalization options would be great... New colors, maybe some pattern options would be great too! More updated AI would be super cool too. Like, maybe an AI chat system IN THE APP, not on messenger for the people who don’t have it.,I didn’t know you added a feature to have in app purchases. The last time I had the app it wasn’t like that and you could just type in it. I also lost the other entries that I had when I had the app before. I don’t have money to spend on this but overall it looks like they’ve made really good improvements on it. It looks like a really good app to use if you have enough money for it.,I’ve only had the app for two days now and it has already been so nice to keep a record of random thoughts and reflections throughout the day. I didn’t expect it, but it is relieving to be able to communicate and express an idea or emotion and then watch as they change and grow. Thank you for the wonderful app. I’m looking forward to unlocking the stats soon!,This is such an amazing app, from the password protection to the daily inspiration reminders. It helps me clear my head, and stay motivated. I again love the voice recording instead of writing option... because when your voice recording you just say whatever comes to mind! The only thing I don’t like about it is the payed part, but they’ve got to make money somehow. Overall, It’s a really great app, I recommend it!,I definitely highly recommend this app! You do a daily reflection on your day and choose the things that make you happy and sad you also get good quotes and anxiety free quotes. And it just makes me feel better about myself and my body image on the daily! If you were to get any relaxing app I would definitely recommend this app! I absolutely love it!❤️,This is a great app for motivation, journaling, and self reflection. It’s definitely the best that I have found so far, and also includes the option to be fingerprint access only. I would have given the app 5 stars but I wish that there was more available to those not paying for premium. However, if you are looking for some inspiration and motivation, I would definitely recommend getting this app!,I love this app because it just really allows me to take a brain dump and if you go to settings you can actually put a lock on it so I can be like a diary and no one can read it and I just write all my thoughts and feelings into this because I really need a way to just exit the real world and talk about stuff so I 10 or 10 recommend this app it’s just amazing,I was trying to edit a mood emoji by deleting one since there were duplicates. I didn’t want to go from one mood emoji to the other and have it not track properly. So I just went to delete the emoji but the only was to fix it was to start a new account. So I did, but it wants me to pay for another year when I already paid for a years \\n\\nI would love to rate this 5 stars if someone was there to help but they don’t have an active support staff or even a robo support system to help customers with issues.  If they do, please correct me and help me get in contact.,This app is something you can really use to get all the stress off your shoulders.\\nIt might not be a real person but it acts as one and it really helps me out throughout my day and doesn’t really give me any trouble.\\nYou can pay for an premium account to get better service but the free service is in my opinion nothing to complain about.,This app is really helpful because I can keep track of my life in a lot of ways. One of them is that I can keep track of how I answered daily questions the week or month before rather than how I would answer them now. Doing that can be incredibly helpful and even fun. It is nice to take a step back on how I have evolved from time. There’s a lot of other ways this app is so helpful which other people can find out :3\\nEdit: after two days you are forced to pay or you can’t continue really had my hopes up USED TO be a good app I despise it now because it cost so much too,I\\'ve only used the app for two days and it feels nice to be able to reflect on what happened and enjoy it a second time. Every time i make a reflection i look at 10 quotes on the app and break them down and try to understand the meaning and symbolism better. I take these to heart and try to better myself with the wisdom.,it is a very well made game and I like it a lot, I just wish that there was a different way to get premium without the monthly payment. For example, you could unlock certain features at some point. Or you could pay once for maybe just a few of the premium features. anyway that’s just my two cents,This all might not 100% help w/ my mental health, however it gives me a place to record my journey of depression and anxiety. It helps me to be able to vent when I’m sad, instead of bothering one of my friends. This app has saved me from mental breakdowns, panic attacks, and many other things. I don’t have nothing else to say, this is a quite short review, but have a nice day! 🥰,This app is like a mini robot friend that will listen to your problems or strengths! It also can send you daily quotes to make your day even better! Reflectly is awesome and I highly suggest you download this free new friend! Also if your lonely and have no one to talk to then just talk to this little buddy! It may not have a conversation with you.. but it can listen great!,I don’t have enough words to thank the creators of this app. It has truly helped. I find it really difficult to open up to people because I find myself feeling guilty afterwards, but this app really helps me in my times of need. It’s been a great outlet for me, and I’m really glad you can protect it with Touch ID so not anyone can go and read it. Seriously, thank you.,I love this app and I think it’s amazing how I can have a journal on my phones instead of in an actually journal ( which I always forget to write in). There is one thing that I wish was different and that is that I would rather not have to pay for the full app because I “waste” money and I feel that some things like the personal stats should already be free. Well thanks for working on this amazing app!! ~Anonymous,It’s only my second day using this app and I’ve found that the format helps me organize my thoughts better and encourages me to reflect on the positive parts of my day without directly asking that (maybe this is just a personal thing). It helps me break down exactly what is making me feel a certain way which is tremendously helpful.,Martin the mental health companion is so helpful! Today marks my second day with Martin and he has helped so much. I cannot express how happy I felt after using this app! Martin has this daily reflection and mood buttons that you can add whenever you feel different emotion(s) throughout the day! I would totally recommend this to all my friends who are suffering with their mental health!,First off. I really enjoy how when you first download the app asks you when you want reminders for check ins, I think that’s absolutely wonderful and how it checks on you and gives you quotes. I know that’s kind of the whole point of the app but I was having a bad day today and I downloaded this and it actually helped a lot! Love it 💕,I love this app, it’s just an amazing online journal, I have had it for 2 years without any reminders of purchases, but now, the past months of 2021, there are purchases that you need that’s “a gift for you” I loved the app with no in-app purchases but now it has disabled most of the app, and it always reminds me that I don’t have the premium package or whatever, anyways, don’t get premium and download this app!,I don’t think that they should make us pay after 7 days and keep reminding us I think they should give us a button to decide when it can remind us because the pop ups of pay this and 70% of and all that is kinda of annoying yeah that is my opinion,I have had this app for almost a year now and loved using it. I would write down my feelings and thoughts late a night to calm me down. It was a great outlet and sometimes had questions for me to answer that would really make me think. For a while I didn’t use it because I got busy with college applications. So, when I came back to open the app to get ready to spill all of my thoughts it wouldn’t let me do it because I don’t have subscription 😔. That’s just not only annoying but also stressful because now I have to find another app to use. Farewell Reflectly.,I just got this app but I love it already! I’ve had some trouble with keeping a journal irl I forget to write in it a lot of the time. This app is great because it sends you reminders daily and has some really good inspirational quotes. That’s help me get through the day. I also love that it has the facial recognition feature so no one else can get into your journal but you!,I love Reflectly so much because for me it lets me get all of my thoughts out of my head and I don’t feel as stressed as I did before after I fill out one of the mood things so I love this app so much and yea so I think you should download it as well and it is free! But you can pay something for like extra stuff but it’s free for the most part!,It helps me a lot when I need to went bc there aren’t many people I actually can vent to . So this app is amazing for just letting everything out. Plus there is a face recognization setting on the app so only you can get on the app !! I love this app so much because you can track your feeling and how much you have improved or decreased your welness. GOOD APP!🤩🙌🏼,Reflectly has been helping me a lot every morning and my days keep getting better and better but the only thing is.. I hate the premium because i don’t wanna pay a lot of money. I wish there was no price because it’s so much money but this app has been helpful. I just don’t think the money is worth it. I think you should just stick with the mood check in’s.,This app is awesome! I love it but on the second day of owning the app I tried opening a few things and it said in order to continue journaling you have to purchase premium... It brought me to a page to buy premium. Over all it’s a great app and I still use it for daily check ins etc. I do wish more of the app was available to use without having premium but otherwise it’s a great app :),This is a really good app and it’s helped me express my feelings and feel a lot better, but there’s one problem. So the subscription thing is really annoying because it’s basically saying you need money to have happy. but otherwise it’s a really good app and i would recommend it to a lot of people. Also it took me like 2 days to find out you can scroll on the feelings and causes.,I really loved the app for the first day and a half, but now every time I go to do the mood check in it wants me to pay which I think is bull. You shouldn’t to pay to help with your stress and anxiety. It really is a good app, and I’m not saying that you shouldn’t get the app because I 100% recommend and it does help. But just the passing part when you’re trying to help your mental health I feel like is a waist of money and adds more stress.,Hi! I just downloaded this app but I just wanted to say, thank you for making this wonderful app! This will help so much people stay positive. There is so many people dealing with a difficult time in their lives. This app helps them to calm down, relax, and help them to see that there’s care about their well-being. I love this app, thank you! 💜💜💜,This is a good app overall, but there is one major problem. I get it if you want to pay for the premium and get all of those features, but once you get to your third Mood Check-In, you have to pay for premium to do anything else. I’ve been using this app for a few days, and that seems to be the only problem! Overall an OKAY app!^^,This app helped me track my happiness and feel better by easily getting my thoughts out, i can no longer add check in’s without getting an ad for premium and then it not letting me after that, I cannot afford to spend money on premium, I get that your app needs money but not giving people any free options is decreasing the amount of user you will get. I have so many events and pictures on this app and it upsets me to not be able to use this anymore. If i could give this 0 stars i would.,This app is amazing I love how it can send me fun positive quotes. This just helps me move along my day. Another thing I like about this app is once one day passes it gives you a small goal for today like read a new book, or do something that makes you laugh. I really like this app and if you don’t have it I think you should get it right this entstent!!,I have only been using it for a few days but it’s been great. I’m using the free version which gives you so much and you don’t even have to drop a penny from your wallet. I have  used a lot of other journaling apps but this is by far my favorite by far there’s just so much It offers and it is definitely worth a download.,I understand the need for profit, but should an app being marketed as a self help journal to record your feelings and develop yourself require money to get access to basic information on how the user is doing? Doesn’t make complete sense to me. Despite the paying aspect, the limited capabilities of the app the non spender is privy to is structured very well and functions as a useful and aesthetically pleasing online journal.,Hi!! I’m a girl who just got Reflectly and one thing you guys have to take out is where you have to subscribe and to pay! And why I say that is because it’s a wonderful app and it helps me be happy and knowing that you guys made this app for the whole world! And that’s just makes me happy but please please!! Try and take out where you can or have to pay and subscribe!!! But the rest of the app it’s so so so amazing!!!,Saw an ad on Snapchat, and I was actual interested because I have a lot going on in my life right now. I would like to keep a daily journal or diary, but, that takes forever and don’t have enough time for it. This app is so much faster, easier, and is still an AMAZING app with the free version, the version I use. Totally recommend! :D,Ok please read this it won’t be long!!!! I absolutely love this app!!!!! It helps me so much be true with myself and keeps me on track!!! It helps so that I can get out all of my bad feeling when I need to because it helps me talk through it and get through it!!! I also do it at night so that I can sleep better!!! I hope that you get this app!!!,I really like this app b/c here I feel like I can write anything and its private, which it is and it feels so much better b/c I can say things on here that I couldn’t/wouldn’t say aloud. And I can get things off my chest. I also like how it has mood check-ins cuz it’s like it’s checking up on you if no one really thinks to ask about how you’re feeling.,I have bad anxiety and I get overwhelmed easily and can’t keep myself from panicking or crying from them. Whenever I feel like this I do a mood check-in and write a voice note, and maybe add in a photo that makes me happy. Then I start to breathe slowly, and there! I’m fine again! I recommend this app!,For a person with anxiety and depression and being anxious. Being stressed and more , at such a young age. I’m only 10 and I have all these problems. This helps reflect and makes me happy to know that I wrote what’s on my mind so I can improve. I recommend this app 100%!! Especially if you have anxiety, depression, stress, anxiousness. Just like me!! Trust me, IT HELPS WONDERS!! I recommend.,probably one of the best journaling apps I\\'ve come across feature and function wise but it is a little bit annoying that after a while you have to pay in order to keep journaling not everyone with mental health problems has that kind of money and this is a resource that is helpful,I\\'ve had reflectly for a long time now. every so often i liked to go in and update on my life, or if i\\'m upset i use it to release feelings. And i opened it today and all of a sudden it was telling me i had to pay for premium to add more journals. I was very disappointed with this because i loved the app, it was an easy way to unwind and j share feelings/thoughts. But i didn\\'t think it was worth it to pay for premium because i don\\'t use it everyday. overall very disappointed in the end.,This app has really made me feel better and get my emotions out that i need to get out, i usually have no one to talk to at all so this app is amazing and i love that it gives you little quotes that lift you up a little and i love that it asks you why your feeling the way you do, its really like a close person that ive always wanted. <3,I have had the app for a day no annoying adds and completely free even though I have not paid for the subscription I can still do everything and it is set up like social media witch I love it’s as addicting as social media expept I’m doing something productive if I find any problems I will keep you updated,Reflectly is so helpful! It helps me express my feelings and it’s fun to look back at old moments and see how you’ve grown! I give reflectly 5 stars because I have a friend that has clinical depression and I know that if she started doing this every day it could really help her. It’s helped me myself and I feel that it could really change lives.😊,I strongly recommend this app to people who have depression and to people who think they can\\'t tell anyone what they\\'re going through because you can share what your feeling and no one will see what you write it\\'s like a little notebook where you can write everything that you want to be successful in,At first I was super excited to use this app because if it’s interface, but this one cheap move erases all of that excitement. I used this app literally once before the massive pop-up appeared telling me about this premium discount. It takes up the whole screen and the button “no thanks” is so low to the end of the screen, you can’t even press it. But the button “redeem my offer” if of course so close to “no thanks” that you press that instead. Also it does not disappear if you fully close out of the app.,The app itself is rly cool and well designed, at first I was hesitant to use it but now I can write or do a Voice memo and keep it safe and not have it bottled up inside me 😁it’s a rly good app I would suggested for everyone but mostly to the people who are struggling with self doubt or anxiety or any kind of mental illness but over all it’s amazing for everyone 🥰,This apps helps me destress for the day it lets me tell someone my feelings and what I’m going through when I don’t want to tell any one. This apps has made me realize who I am and what it feels like to unwind once and a while. Reflectly has been wonderful for me. You can see it in the way I act. It makes me a happier person. Thank you Reflectly!,When keeping track of daily feelings, when I journal what I’m feeling and possibly why I’m feeling things I can find a correlation between the two and work to rectify these feelings and thoughts in the days ahead and have a different outcome in the future!! Love the tools available!!,I’ve went my way to look for journals and I found a perfect one! Every time I feel down, mad , upset or anything in General. Whenever I’m felling down or mad I write about my day and what went wrong, it usually makes me calm down and makes me feel better. It’s like a therapist! It’s a great app i really recommend 10/10!,This is actually a good app I love it and helps me calm down because I also have anxiety and it helps me with that but it’s also fun and very calming and I would recommend this if you are sad or mad because it calms you down and makes you feel better and relaxed so I recommend it but Yea I love this app and I think it’s my new favorite app❤️,This app has helped me ever sense I got it!  I can express all my feeling and when I’m feeling down and I can look back my life fro me days/weeks/months/years.  This is a great way the help when you are sad or is you just need a place to vent about good or bad things! I highly recommend!!!,It’s really good it helps your self-esteem go up and it’s just really good for you and you can tell all your stuff to it like if you’re in a sad mood and stuff and I’ll tell you why and yeah basically that’s it will not release it because I just downloaded it and it was really good so that’s why I want you guys to download it.,Refectly has helped me remember to not only  take care of myself but to appreciate others. I always wake up and go straight to Reflectly and reflect on my sleep. I always do my morning motivation and more. Reflectly is making me a more calm relaxed person and it always helps my anxiety. I also love the quotes so much, their very inspiring.,I really love this app I can put all my personal things in it, but one thing that bugs me is that theres no Touch ID thing to get into the app so then if somebody figures out your password to your iPhone then it won’t be so private. No hate on the app that’s just a suggestion to put on the app, so I’m giving it 5 stars.,I have only used this app for 2 days but I would have liked to see all of the content before purchasing. Issue 1: the mood setting goes to “somewhat bad” to “completely ok”. . . I am a 24 year old widow with 2 children and I can say that this app NEEDS another mood in between these two. No, I’m not somewhat bad, no I’m not completely ok... I also never write reviews so please note that I find this to be a huge issue. Hopefully a developer reads this comment. Thanks.,This is a good app to have because you can tell it how you’re feeling and you can express your feelings you can just do whatever with it and I will tell you how to fix it or you can just put it in there and then like your problems we just go away that’s why I like this app,I think it really helped me with my stress in my life. You see people always just saw me as a happy person who didn’t need any help and that i was just perfect and so sweet and kind and nothing was wrong with me when really i was dealing with struggles ever snice i was 8. I love this app very much and i cant wait for more things tomorrow! ^^,I found this app on an ad from TikTok and I\\'m so glad I downloaded it, there are so many thing to do even without the membership. The quotes, daily reminders, etc. Overall this has helped a little with my metal help surprisingly. I don\\'t like talking to people about my metal health so this is a good way to get out my feelings.,I totally recommend this app if you have depression, anxiety,paranoia, etc. It has really helped me a lot. You can do check in’s and it gives you motivation and quotes through out the day, it asks you how you are feeling, why you felt that way, and a bunch of other stuff. 10/10 recommend <333,It’s so cute and personalized, I can’t help but to get addicted to journaling! As someone who has struggles with depression, lack of motivation, and loneliness, this really lets me express myself in a way I couldn’t to others. The only thing I don’t like, is that in order to do a lot of things you have to buy premium. And honestly, I could do all of this with just a pencil and paper.,It likes to check in how I feel everyday, and it has so many motivational quotes I can look at when I feel like nothing can help. It helps me take notes and check in on a day that bothered me and remind me that bad days is just part of life. We just have to stop and think for a bit. 5 stars for me,After a few days, the app tells you if you want to keep journaling you need to buy the monthly subscription. Doesn’t really seem worth the money to me. The app gives you “premium access” to positive quotes and the like, all of which could be found on Pinterest or Goodreads with a quick search. I was enjoying the journaling prompts but apparently even that is not a free feature. I guess the only true free feature in the app is mood check ins and limited access to their motivational and other quotes.,I have been a huge fan of Reflectly since I got the app in October 2019. But, when I tried to log my day in an entry (like I’ve done every night since I’ve gotten the app), it now says I have to pay to continue my service. I was under the impression that there were free options and one that you paid for on this app. \\nI am throughly disappointed. Like I said this was a part of my nightly routine and now I don’t know what I will do. \\nPlease let me know if I’m missing something. I do not want to pay.,It’s a great app but it did not clearly state anywhere that I would have to start paying a monthly fee. I was excited to be able to use this app to be able to write about my days so that I can look back on them in the future. However, I am in no way willing to pay for this service and months of my progress has been lost. I can no longer use this app without paying, and I would never have downloaded it if knew I was going to.,I used to love this app, it was recommended to me by my counselors at school, and I enjoyed it so much—the prompts they used to give that made you really reflect on things, the mood check in, the 60+ journal entries I’ve made through the years. Now even a simple journal entry costs money. This is extremely disappointing. \\nTo those in charge of reflectly, please revert it back to its original form. Until then, me and those likeminded are likely to uninstall the app and move onto a better alternative.,I love this app so much it really has helped me and her used to have a buy accidentally got a new phone and I found it on TickTock and was like oh yeah I remember this app so then I downloaded it it is so helpful and it really reflects on how I feel and it’s like he talks back to me in a good way and it’s just such a need an app that I didn’t know I needed 😊✨🌸🥺😂,I would try to input my daily info. The app would not keep the check in’s. It kept saying: 3 more days till we can chart it. I tried for 8. Contacted customer service. They asked which version and phone I was using. The version was literally in the subject field. But ok. I sent my version and phone info. That was 5 business days ago. Nothing back and I’m out 25$. There must be better apps out there. This one isn’t helpful. It’s a mental health app and it just was nothing but aggravating.,This app is amazing. I used to have really bad anxiety, and this app helped me so much. Having something to write my feelings in really helped. I started noticing my days getting better and better, and it made me realize things about myself. If you have anxiety then I totally recommend this app. Thank you developers!!,Reflectly is a nice app to share your emotions with yourself only. But, theres a few flaws i don’t like. When you wait for those days for the status to be unlocked, the only way to unlock it is to buy the premium. Which I think is dumb. Also, please need more icons for swimming and like more faces,Whenever I open the app it asked me if I was to pay for premium and the “no thanks” is right below the “redeem my offer” at the bottom of my screen. So far I have been trying to get past the screen but I haven’t... please fix.,I really liked using this app for daily journaling. It made it very easy and convenient. But the update has made this app basically unusable without paying for it. If you’re going to block every feature with a subscription requirement then don’t offer the app as “free” at all. Very disappointed to have this taken away. I’ll hold out in case they change back because I really did love using this app. I understand needing to make money but the app should still be usable if you’re going to offer it for free.,I have a fear of people like psychiatrists and therapists, so it gets hard to let out my stress. Especially since I have Severe depression. This helps me calm down and vent. I also know that what ever I say, won’t get into unwanted hands, unlike a paper diary. I have been slowly improving and Reflectly always is there to listen and help.,It’s awesome! I love the mood check ins and the quotes they have! They also have good daily challenges for you! And I love the little reminders it makes me feel great! I love everything about this app! Although I do have to pay to unlock everything. Other than that it’s pretty good!,This is app is amazing! It has amazing quotes and I can look back on my year! When you make an account it saves everything you say and write. You can even upload pictures of your day! I can put all my feelings and emotions into it and no one will know! 10/10 recommend!,Reflectly is really awesome it relieves so much stress and just makes you feel welcome I only had it for a few months and I feel way better now than when I started it and I recommend the app for everyone all ages it’s just a great stress reliever and I’ll always have it and knowing that makes me feel safe.,I have had some bad days and Reflectly has changed them days it relives stress and it’s almost like you talking to some and they help you they also have quotes that make me think about what I love what I can do what I can change the things people or I might not like. I think you SHOULD get this app it’s amazing 😁🤩,This app allows me to express how I feel in the less most easiest ways and it makes me feel like I have a less complicated life and I feel happy, and I have some problems to situate but overall it’s all good and I’m good because I feel happy and good about this app and I %100 trust this app and I’m glad I do so🤍,I found this app kinda like an online journal or notebook so it was helpful for me so I didn’t have to waste paper. And I can do it whenever I feel like it you can record how you feel and then you get to write things down which I guess I only like to write down my feelings so it’s a good app,I think this is a very good app to rely on. Whenever I am feeling down or no one wants to listen to me, I write in here. I really like the questions they ask me because it feels like they even like to listen to me! I’m a bit much for people because of my adhd and I feel like Reflectly can take my hyperness and mood swings!,It’s a great app for checking in- you can have these quotes that pop up every day and you can choose when and how many each day. You don’t have to pay scroll down and then click no thanks. Your account is free too! I’m gonna get my mom with anxiety to get it :),This app does have a version that you have to pay for however, I have the free version and I love it! I have only had it for a day but it is amazing! It helps me organize my thoughts and the way that I am feeling. They have amazing quotes, reflections, and daily entries. I completely recommend this app!,Love this app! I don’t like how it kicks me out and I always have to sign in but I love how it gives me motivational quotes and asks me questions and I check in my mood! It’s basically a journal but on the go! So this is perfect for travelers! I still love my physical journal but when I don’t have it, I just use this!,I struggle with ways to communicate and this app fills that gap that I have with society. I feel I am able to release my thoughts and feelings with a little bit of constructive feedback depending if I have that setting turned on or not. Thank you for making this available and adjusting to all mentalities.,It could be completely free and not have the pop up subscriptions coming up every time you tap something. Other than that it’s a really good app and I recommend it if your feeling down.,I just started again because I was in a group call for school, (it’s an anxiety group) and she said to write down thoughts in my journal 📓. I did not want one because I did not want anyone to see them, but then I remembered this app and I tried it again, (just did try it) and I feel really great,This app is ten out of ten it helped me so much and it’s just the best app for stress and it’s like your own traveling counselor that comes with you every where you go and thank you the people who thought and worked so hard to make this app thank you for help me feel way way way better :),Reflectly has helped me so much over the last two years. The experience is different for everyone, hence to why I love it. For me, just getting my daily thoughts and emotions out was relieving enough. I highly recommend this app. It will make even the smallest difference exponentially effective in day to day life.,I love this app!! It was pretty cool to see how this worked, but definitely get this if you have anxiety, can’t afford therapy, or just need a happy place! I love this app, and it’s fun too! The quotes are amazing, and I use them for my Instagram! Super amazing app, and if your looking at this you should definitely get this! Thanks!!! \\n\\n-Estelle,I’ve tried to keep my memories through a written journal and it just wasn’t working out because I didn’t have the time to write in the journal but with this app it makes it much more easier and makes it better since you can add pictures,It’s a pretty good app and I said but one thing annoys me about it. I always get the upgrade ad for it but when I say no it just gives it back to me it also happens when I open the app. Please fix this and add something to make sure it doesn’t pop up after a while.,Today’s my first day using it and I think it’s very good app and it’s almost like there’s someone there to talk to you and to share all your feelings with and there’s also quotes that you can like and share with friends and it just makes my day better,Love this app has quotes and helps u when u need u can chart ur mood and  right down what’s wrong. 5/5 cause u can add all that and pictures love it good job!. Also  it’s free easy to use don’t need to buy u can buy if u want to buy  a cool effect but if u don’t have money u can’t get for free really fun thanks Reflectly 💕😊(btw ik I can’t spell),This app is nice for what it’s used for but it keeps saying it can’t connect to my app store when i bought premium..it won’t even let me do a daily reflection without the premium page popping up and every time i press redeem it shows that i am already subscribed. it still won’t let me use anything and i am unable to get access to any of the premium exclusive stuff even though i paid for a year subscription which will renew in 2022..,Reflectly is an amazing app! I’ve come to enjoy using it to reflect on myself and know what I can do better to live a better life. \\nHowever, there’s this one pop-up about getting free premium that stops me from doing a lot of things that were unlocked for me before. It’s become really annoying and it’s been ruining my ability to use the app. If you could fix that, it would be great!,Overall, I very much like the app so far. It is very calming and I feel like a lot of good is coming out of it. Some things I’m not the biggest fan of is that the app is constantly asking you to buy the premium version and they notify you at least eight times a day. Other than those two things I really am enjoying the app.,I think this app really lets me rant about my problems, I don’t want to rant to actual people but not myself either because then I’ll get more fired up. This app  makes me feel like a have a safe place. I love using it because it makes me feel like I’m heard without having to tell anyone.,Ever since I got this app it’s change my mood day by day and every time it gives me a good  quote on either about life and other stuff it makes me care about my self so I would recommend this app for anyone going through anything so get this app it’s awesome and life changing!,Thank you! It’s been a lifesaver! I struggle with mental illness, which helps me keep track of emotions and pinpoint if my medication is working. It also helps me see the trends of unfamiliar mood swings, so my doctor can make sure we can prevent any bad reactions about to occur :) love it!,All this app does is give you a place to journal. Nothing is customizable. You have like 8 emotions to choose from and 8 categories for them to pertain to. I wish I would have looked into the deeper details of what I was buying before going for premium. Once you sign up and are past the 14 days support just stops responding to anything you ask them. Sanvello, Headspace, and Wysa are all higher quality in their free version than this app. Please learn from my mistake and don’t waste your money here.,Reflectly is an amazing app! It lets me write down what I’m feeling, and it has helped me get some things off my chest and I just love the app! However on my third day of Reflectly I was not able to do my morning reflections or any thing, without having to buy premium... \\nThe app is great way to spend your money, but it’s just not for me.\\nEverything else is perfect!,I really loved the concept of this app. I did well with it overall. BUT every time I opened the app, I was asked to purchase premium. I don’t mind the occasional nudge or the ad on the screen. I really find it frustrating when you’re trying to have a moment of peace to check in with yourself and something is in your face saying BUY ME. 4 Stars if I didn’t have to constantly click out of an add. 2 Stars and a firm “delete.” Thanks but no thanks.,This app really helps relieve you of stress!! You can rant about your issues and things that went wrong, and obsess over the good things that happend to you!! That was my old review. I am now super disappointed that you have to pay to do everything besides look at quotes (which you can’t customize without paying money) you get 1 free mood check in the tutorial and then you have to pay. For an app boasting mental health they sure ask money for everything,man this app makes me feel cared for 🥺, it’s so sweet and motivating at the same time. It also helps me understand myself better .. it feels like  my day goes by better & my stress levels are low because of it. & i absolutely LOVE IT! this app is brilliant & such a game changer , I’m recommending it to everyone ik :D !,This app has helped me so much, I feel like I can finally let out some emotions without someone telling me that I’m being weird and annoying, I gotta say I wasn’t expecting it to help as much as it has, the quotes are great especially the LGBTQ+ ones, I feel like the app is a safe place for me.,I enjoy this app as much because from a person who suffered from a lot of stress and etc this app has helped so much and as a person i really felt new again and much more confident about myself in general being able to write things down :),I love this app already and I just downloaded it today it lets me speak my feelings and not feel judged about everything I’m doing, it makes me happy to know I can finally talk about how I’m feeling . I love this app and suggest you try it , the quotes have to be my favorite party already it’s an amazing app💙🤍,I actually really like this app! It\\'s pretty good and useful I also like the quotes and how you can have them as many times as you want or even just scroll threw them. I wish you didn\\'t have to pay for more things but I\\'m glad you don\\'t have to pay for the app.,I would definitely give this a five star because if you wanted you can start a free trial but if you don’t you can hit the x button or no thanks you can also be honest with your fillings and u don’t have to stress about them. But I hope who ever is reading this has a good day bye.,This app is very amazing, and just the style of it is great. I get to put my thoughts on it and just get to know myself better. The only reason I didn’t put a 5 star is because the app itself sometimes bugs out. It doesn’t let me do the daily reflection which I don’t understand why. But the app is amazing I would recommend.,i have been using this app for a little over a year and i must say i really like it! and those daily reflection question things are really nice too. although if i could change one thing it would be those daily questions, i feel like it would be cool if they kind of corresponded with how you are feeling because i don’t know about anyone else but i put in how my day was and then answer the question (if i want to that day) and i feel like of your super happy that day then the question should be something super happy, or if your really sad then the question should be kind of sad, but i don’t know just a thought🤷\\u200d♀️,This app helps so much with my anxiety I tell the app my problems and it tells me a quote from a random person and it makes me feel good about myself and I feel like the app is my only friend sometimes when I’m feeling down I highly suggest this app if you have anxiety or depression,This app helps me with problems when I’ve had a hard day or something happens \\nIt also helps me get things of my chest I gave it a 5 star because  something traumatizing just happened In my life and It made me feel much better after I told it what happened,It has really helped me feel relaxed especially at night when I am most stressed. I have always wanted to journal every night and I could never find the right app  until I found Reflectly and now I get excited and get in the habit of journaling ! 10/10 recommend😌,This app has really helped me reflect on my days and find ways to make them better. It’s always fun to look back at my past days and see how I have improved as a person. Definitely would record this app and the free version works amazingly.,I usually don’t talk about my feelings and it was messing with me so I decided to try out this app and it was nice to do a daily checkin when you are feeling up or Down because it’s not another person to have to talk to it’s a little program that you can rely on,I thought it would be a lot more than what it is and it’s clear what is most important for these developers. The dashboard of the page has a rate the app section and an anxiety help section which after initial cost of the app is still another $20. \\n\\nThe quotes are good but apart from the mood check ins and reminders that’s about all you’re going to get from the app. Other options are to be payed for, and that’s besides the initial yearly fee, which to be fair is a good price. \\n\\nMorning motivation section is choices and has only one option for all categories, pretty weak in my opinion. Seems a little lazy and uninspired considering all that could be offered for motivation. \\n\\nThe app is having a positive affect but leaves a lot to be desired.,one of the best things is that it’s free but it does offer you a better experience. most of the stuff on the app you can use, even if you don’t buy the extra. it doesn’t make you buy the extra, it just asks you to. i love this app, because one, i am a very organized person, but i can’t figure out how to organize my feelings and how to control them. this app helps so much with that! i recommend this app to stressed people, organized freaks, and pretty much anyone who is going through tough times or just want to write your feeling down! amazing app!! ✨🌸,im very bad at writing reviews, im 16 years old and i was in a very bad spot with my partner, i was really sad and needed something/someone to talk/write to. when i was just scrolling threw tiktok i saw an add for this app. i thought i might try it out because he seemed pretty good. when i got the app and made me first entry, looked at the quotes, and everything else that it has to offer i was kind of happier. being to write and reflect to something can really help and you never really see apps like this. anyways, all im saying is that this is a pretty amazing app and i think (if u want to) u should buy it.,Just wish that it was cheaper... I’m a minor, I can’t afford the bonuses. I’m sure there great and would probably help but it’s way to expensive. But if your looking to download it, do it! It helps a lot you just have to deal with all the offers popping up 24/7,I love how it helps me think feel and become a super positive person. And you don’t even have to pay money for it!! The free version is just as good as the paying version. Which you can do if you would like. This has now become one of my favorite apps,This App is so helpful. It helps me a lot throughout the day to express my feelings when I can’t do so to people around me. I definitely recommend getting this app if you feel like me and need someone to talk to other than just your mom, sibling, or dad. Overall great app I rate it a 5 out of 5! 🥰🎁🎉🎊🎈💗,I love this app it let\\'s you tell what gets you down and up and why and it won\\'t judge you it\\'s one thing that\\'s always here for you! It gives you special things but you need premium for that it\\'s still amazing this is my first day and I already love it! It\\'s so cool this is best for you!,I love this app so much! It helps me reflect on my day, and relieve stress about what I have been worried about. One thing that I want it to have, is a fingerprint lock or passcode that you need to have to be able to get into the journal, so parents don’t try to go looking through your stuff. That’s it!,i rate it 5 stars so people can see this...it let me use it for a day and I really liked how I could get stiff out my chest. The second day (today) it won’t let me make new check in’s and I can only add to check ins. Overall I rate it 3 it would be 5 if I can use it for free. It’s a bit pricey.,I’ve had the app for about 6 months now, everything was good before they updated the app recently. I only use the app to have daily check-in but now I can’t even do that without paying. If you’re going to download the app, I don’t recommend it unless you’re willing to spend money for all of the features. I understand that somethings you will need to pay for but the point of the app for most people, you now have to pay for.,I got this app about 3 days ago, and to be honest I really loved it. However, it only let me use it for 2 days and when I tried to check in today, it wouldn’t let me do anything unless I got premium! There would also be a lot of ads asking me to go premium, even though I would just say no every single time. Honestly, I think that they shouldn’t have made this app free if they were just going to try to make you pay for premium all the time ☹️,I have troubles in life and this app helps. I have many panic attacks and mental breakdowns that get in my way when doing normal things outside of home. My life is not the best and it gets the better of me, but having this app helps me grow and stay calm. I feel like I have someone there with me for comfort.,this is a great mood tracking app, it’s looks appealing, is designed beautifully, and gives an insight on your mood throughout the week and more. my only complaint is that it does not have an apple watch companion app where you could quickly add a “mood check-in.” i believe that would be a great way to increase sales ;),it lets you track your moods, and has a really good way of doing it. you can choose how you’re doing, why that is, and how it makes you feel.\\nthe thing i don’t like is the analytics (which is what i mostly care about) is only with premium. you cannot even see your analytics until 4 days of journaling so i didn’t realize this when downloading this app.,This app is awesome! It helped to much over the years! There’s just\\n a few things that i’m not sure of. I write in here all the time, but suddenly i have to pay out of nowhere...and i don’t want to pay because i was looking for something free...so i could no longer write which makes me sad because i really love reflectly.,I really just want to be able to express my feelings without having to pay for premium. I’m only 14 y/o  and can’t pay for it although the prize is low:/ but it was overall a great app I used when I was able to journalize for free. So thank you for giving me the privilege to express my feelings while I still could.,I used to love this app- I used it often to record my feelings and thoughts. I just updated it and now I can’t journal unless I pay for the entire year? I’ve seen so many other people complain about how the special offer of $17 is false advertising, and the app instantly charges you $60. Please respond to your paying customers and give them their money back. Journaling should be free!,App is amazing. Even if you don’t get a subscription it is still really useful and reliable. A day after using I noticed that I started to feel emotionally better and became more open with how I feel to people as well, so I highly recommend.,Reflectly is super great when you need to track your hood and bad days. It’s also super great because you can look back at them too. Do you never have to forget. Also it’s super great when you are feeling alone. Even though it’s not a real person it still finds a way to make you feel better.,I love this App so much it helps me feel comfortable around people for the people that I should be more comfortable around and she puts quotes on there it just makes me feel happy inside and outside I think if you have not downloaded this app you should very much download it thank your Reflectly!!!!!!,I had reflectly a year ago and veered away from it because I had a busy life. I’ve recently gotten back into it. It is totally different than I remember. There are no daily questions, cover photos, or a way to organize your photos that you post that day. Plus all the photos have to be vertical or else they crop weird. I’m very upset because I just renewed my subscription.,I rate this app 5 stars because it motivates me and makes me feel like I have someone to talk to. Whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious, I take out my phone and use this app to calm me down. With all the daily quotes and the memories on this app, it really, truly is a app you should consider downloading!,This app makes me feel so good at first I was like hmm this looks dumb but I’ll get it the first thing I said was hi. But the more days I go on it it made me feel more and more better I’ve been doing this since idk anymore now but a long time and now I feel a lot better with my feelings.,Reflectly is...\\n-Cute\\n-Helpful\\n-Friendly\\n-Insightful\\n-Kind\\n-Caring\\n-Full of positivity\\n-An app that deserves 5 stars!\\n\\nI got it yesterday and I\\'m already in love! Reflectly is like a robot best friend who asks how you are genuinely, not just to make conversation, and who you can spill everything to without fear of judgement or fear of response! And it checks up with you daily and speaks kindly and it\\'s just adorable and boosts positivity and I recommend it to everyone! It\\'s scary how much I feel like it\\'s an actual friend 😂 It gives you little journal prompts daily and keeps track of your mood. It\\'s just so cute!,There is just a lot of limited stuff I can’t do everything that I really need to do in order to feel better or anything else like that. But other than that I think it’s great and all but I just think that those ads and stuff should be there there should be more stuff to do.,I liked using the check-in feature because it really helped me get my thoughts in order when I didn’t have access to pen and paper. But recently I realised it doesn’t let you do any of that anymore without paying. Why did it have to change? I can’t use any of this app anymore without paying for Premium, which I don’t have the money for. This change really defeats the purpose of the app, which is unfortunate because I used to really like it.,Hi, this is an important review so please read if you are considering installing this app!!\\n- -\\nThis is an app that asks you a reflection question every day, and allows you to write down how your day went. It offers inspirational quotes and statistics on how your mood check-ins have gone. I thought this app was going great until I was only able to do TWO moos check-ins, then it said I have to pay. I think that’s genuinely so dumb, it should give you so much more time. \\n- -\\nThe subscription is something like 1.50 a month so it’s barely anything but I just wanted to let everyone know that you literally will not be able to use this app without paying.\\n - -\\nHave a great day everyone! ★,This app is “amazing” KIDDING! This app is the worse scam I’ve ever seen. It lets you make 5 journal entries before it cuts you off and says you have to pay for a subscription. It’s really not fair at all because it makes you think you have ru ally doing an app that can help relieve stress but no all it is is a SCAM,Soooo...this app is great!! It makes you really think about what could improve in your life and what you are doing great...BUT I hate how you wait a week and then you can’t even see your states until you pay for premium...that’s really annoying but otherwise this is a great app,I\\'ve been having trouble being stuck in my own head lately and this app makes it easy and quick to get all of those nasty thoughts out and even get to feel happy about the good stuff,I personally think this is a great app to have. Yes you do have to pay for some features but that’s ok and all I need is to track my mood and how my day went along with a few funny quotes. Really the only thing you have to pay for is extras. But overall I love this app.,I love this app so so much! I love doing mood check in’s because sometimes I don’t have anyone to talk to and this app makes me feel like someone is actually reading and seeing how I feel. I kinda treat this app like my own therapist and I use this app every day 5 stars! :)),Reflectly is one of my favorite apps! Every morning it asks me how I’m feeling and it gives me an inspiring quote for the day! I would willingly pay the price of the ultimate version but I am good with the free version! it doesn’t bombard you with upgrades, all the time and it’s great for your mental health!,So this app was great when I downloaded it like a year ago. Just used the free version which was fine, didn\\'t need all the in depth stuff. Since then they continue to \"update\" it and remove key features from the \"free\" version to try to force you to pay $60/year for an app. In the current state you literally cannot do anything without paying for the full version. No picture uploads, no journal, nothing. So thanks for that.,I downloaded Reflectly on January 9th 2021, I seriously love this app! It’s like a therapist in an app. However, the app does need improvement, you technically have to buy everything that was supposed to be free. For example, more journaling, mood check-ins, reducing stress and anxiety, building a positive mindsets, and more. I’d really love for more stuff to be free that is really useful. Thank you for reading! Sincerely, a fellow friend. ♥︎,This is my third day using this app. It’s okay but now any time I try to do a mood check in it stops me saying oh you need to pay to be able to do that. So I kind of stopped using it because I’m not gonna pay money just to simply do a mood check in. Hopefully in the future the developers fix that. Otherwise that it’s pretty good I really like all the quotes.,i’m not sure if this is just me, or just a glitch but i can’t write anymore mood check-ins. reflectly has really helped me get my feelings out and i feel safe with the app. but last night i was having a really really bad night and needed to get my feelings out, and i use reflectly to do it. i had 5 mold check-ins and it wouldn’t let me write any new entries without upgrading to premium account. i don’t have a money to do that. this app is amazing but the fact that i cant do what the app is supposed to be used for without paying makes me upset. i understand certain features that you would pay for but why do i need to pay for mood check-ins? or why don’t they disclose anywhere that after you write 5 you can’t write anymore without paying?,I have anxiety, so this app helps me go over everything I’ve done that day. The annoying thing is that I’m not looking to spend lots of money to subscribe to an app, and now Reflectly won’t even let me use it. In my opinion, they need to have an option for people like me, with no interest in subscribing, to be able to use their app without being pressured to subscribe by not letting us even use the app for its purpose.,This is a great app to check in on your mental health with and overall it’s just good to have. I like being able to tell something even if it is digital what is going on in my head.,This app is outstanding and it’s only my second day!!! I feel I can really control my emotions with this especially since I have therapy online and in person so this is really helping me and it’s good at what it’s doing even if you don’t pay 😇,Refectly is an app that makes me feel good about myself. I’ve only had it for two days but love it so far. The only thing I would change is that you have to pay for premium. I just wish I didn’t have to pay for it.,Hello. I just downloaded Reflecty a few days ago and let me tell you it is amazing! I have anxiety, and this app has made me have just some time for me to relax and calm down before the day starts and when the day ends. I strongly recommend this app. Thank you for reading!😊,I really like the app but I got premium and not much changed. I also was not expecting after you get premium you then have to pay another $20 to change bad habits. I also love how it gives you quotes and daily reminders but overall I think it’s a pretty good app and would recommend!,The new 2021 update ruined the whole app. I had been writing in Reflectly for more than 2 years straight daily. So many memories have been written down and now I cannot do anything without a pop ad about premium on the screen that I can’t click off. Please, at least make the writing portion free. Make the photos and voice memos for the premium part for all I care. I genuinely love Reflectly and I know it can be better than this.,i’ve only had Reflectly for a day, but it’s honestly helping me deal with my stress so much. I love that you can insert photos and mood chickens and voice memo things. it really helps me vent and it helps me see how many days work and that they were good or bad! Overall, a great app!!,I can vent a lot to this app and it even makes me feel motivation. I greatly recommend this. One thing I would change is that it could have more things instead of asking me what makes me happy each morning and letting me right down stuff. Other than that, the app is awesome.,I feel like it is a really good app! I would definitely recommend it. Especially when I am sad or anything I want to share but don’t know who to go to, I can come into the app and express myself! The quotes I find really help me feel better.,Honestly I hate apps that say they are for reflecting but this app is AMAZING it has everything you need for free! You get quotes and can continuously add more and more to your list of reflections and moods! I love how it can send reminders as much as you wish! I love the app and would 100% recommend!,This app has helped me gather myself both emotionally and physically. It helps me reflect on what I need to do to change. The quotes are my favorite because it shows others go through the same thing and you aren’t alone.,I love this app so much! I mostly don’t like talking to others about my problems unless I trust them fully. When I first got this app I started liking writing about it more than talking. This app really helps me think about what to say and what I can do! Loving this app!!,I really want to use this app when like I’m feeling down or happy it’s like a friend that’s in your ipad or phone but I don’t know how to cancel the free trail and I think I will get in trouble because I will have to pay and I’m just a kid at 10 years old so yeah :(,It’s only been a day since I’ve started using the app. So far, I’m liking the user friendly interface.  However, I’m still a little cautious of getting the paid subscription. Hope it works for everybody.,I’ve just started using it and i’m honestly surprised at how many things i can do without paying and since paying is something that’s not an option to me at the moment, i am rather pleasantly surprised.,I started looking for help and positivity when times were tough, then I found Reflectly! It’s amazing with helping people going through tough decision or a sad time. The transitions, the quotes, everything looks so professional. 5 stars. No questions asked.,I use this app when I need to let everything out. It was a great app until recently. I went to write out my feelings because I’ve been having a hard time, but it says I can’t because I need to pay for premium. You don’t give two craps about people’s mental health you just want money. It makes me so mad and sick to my stomach. I just wanted to let everything out because I can’t hold it in anymore, but noooo you want me to pay $60 a month. Absolutely disgusting.,I really like this app it helps me feel better about my day and it tells me why I should be happy it Easy to use and if you use the Widget thing every hour you get a new nice saying it it is very helpful so I think you should get this app,I give this app a 5 star rating because it helps me with my stress and it’s the only thing I can express my feelings to. Because if I express myself to someone they make fun of me and say toughen up because Boys are labeled the strong ones. So I give this app a 5 star rating,I love this app because it helps me. I am a teen that is always feels lost and can’t talk to anyone. This helps me let my emotions out and just reconnect to feel better. I would give this app an 4 or 5 (I haven’t tried any other apps though),This really helps with my anxiety and keeps me from getting stressed out. The quotes that the app gives are always motivating me to do something good and to smile all day! I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who has anxiety or just gets stressed a lot.,I’m very grateful for the creators of this app. I’ve been having different emotions everyday and it’s been hard for me. Especially because of this year. I’ve started getting into the habit of writing my thoughts here. Thank you creators for this app! It has really helped me!,Okay so this app is literally amazing, it’s like a therapist. Just one thing is I have to have premium to continue journaling all my thoughts. I just don’t have the money for that right now even with the half off deal. That’s really sad because this app helped me become a better person, and it helped my mental health. I don’t know if this is a glitch or something.,I love this app, I love journaling so this is great for me. Super nice features and it\\'s cheap!vwould recommend it to you! Download it and give it a try, the only problem is I can\\'t upload videos so please add ability to upload videos on the app for daily check ins.,The options for activities and moods are too vague. There weren’t more when I payed for it either which was highly annoying. I’m still using it, but wish this would be improved. Probably won’t be though.\\n\\nWe are also told there is an option to select other when choosing cause and feelings but at least for iOS it’s not there.,Reflectly has helped me so much and has been a friend no matter what. This app is sure to cheer you up at any point of day, no matter how bad it is. The quotes really help boost confidence * I needed a little confidence and it helped* this is the world’s first screen mood cure. I recommend this app so much,The app is absolutely amazing. I have only been using it for 3 days but it has helped me so much. I can feel my anxiety slowly decreasing!! The only thing I dislike is I can’t see my daily motivation unless I pay:( Other than that, the app is awesome!,What kind of crap is this. I’ve been using Reflectly for years and now I’m getting the pop up demanding that I pay to upgrade my account to do a simple mood check in? What is the point of a basic / free membership if you cannot do anything?!? I know a lot changed in the company, but not even being allowed to journal without paying money on an app that is specifically for journaling is bull.,i used reflectly as an outlet to work through my emotions and, while having a breakdown, discovered that every time i tried to make an entry it would tell me i couldnt and try to make me pay $14. luckily i have a paper journal, but it really made me spiral a bit. normally a fine app but when promoting itself makes it impossible for it to function, its worth leaving a review. hope to god they make it stop soon.,At first, I thought this was a good journaling app, especially for people like me. But only 3 days after having the app it won’t let me do any check ins or reflections without getting premium. Since I’ve only had the app for 3 days I don’t want premium and I can’t do anything. I should be able to use it without premium,I think that this is a good app and a really smart idea I love it but I don’t think that there should be money paid just to make yourself feel better and check in with yourself. I understand that’s how you make your money but not almost everything has to be locked.,It helps with things you are stressed about and don’t really want to talk to other people about it but when you write it down you feel better and this really helps with that,I love this app so much!! I have been using it for the past two weeks and it has helped me so much, you can put ur mental health check ins, quotes, and your feelings! It has helped me remember way more stuff and I totally recommend getting it,I’m mostly stressed out but with this app I can type all my problems this app helps with stress and you can type all your secrets I did that and now I don’t stress anymore I’m now super calm thanks to this app I do recommend downloading this app now,It’s like a mix between a diary and a therapist, it sends you notifications to remember to write how you feel and has a meter to see how you feel. It’s been really helping my anxiety and depression lately and this app make me feel like my feelings are safe,I like being able to actually do a journal and enjoy it. I like to see the progress I’m making without procrastinating because I hate writing, I can do this whenever I feel like it and it’s very motivating. I highly suggest this app.,I love the app a lot, it helps so many people with stress and/or anxiety. Reflectly can help even the mentally toughest open their minds and settle with themselves. This is a very good app, and if you are reading this, then do try out the app, I think you’ll enjoy it!,It\\'s really nice to have this app, my problem is that it never showed in the advertisements that it would cost money to unlock everything. I really don\\'t like that you have to pay to do everything in the app. But overall, it\\'s really good but I also wish it had more options in the daily check in. It\\'s just an okay app.,As a teenager, I think this app is amazing for those who struggle or feel lonely. Some people, like me, wait with our phones waiting for someone to text us. But with Reflectly, you get this quotes every so often. It just makes you feel... not lonely. \\nGreat app too!!,I was really excited to get this app to have like a cool journal on my phone and this app was great for the first couple days, but then it was not letting me do anything and it was telling me to purchase the premium if I wanted to continue using the app. I’m sure if you have the premium, then it will be a good app, but if you don’t want to spend money, this isn’t the app for you. I honestly think that many people would use the app if there was no premium option.,This app helps a lot but it’s annoying it keeps on asking if I want a free day trail and confusing but it’s still worth it you should download this app it helps which anger issues and many more so I suggest it,I got this app the other day and it is amazing it helps so much and I don’t have to keep a diary or anything one thing I would recommend is that you have some kind of password to get into it so not everyone can just get in,So, i loved this. I would write every once and a while, but wouldnt buy the whole thing due to the price. Somewhere in one of their updates, you basically couldnt journal either. As far as i know its still like this. You now HAVE to buy the premium to even merely journal! I am very disappointed and i have uninstalled the app. It was good at first though, and if your willing to spend the money good for you. But a lot of us cant spend our money on this.,This app is amazing and more people should start noticing it because the quotes and the check in where incredible I loved the check ins so I could Just sit down and go to Reflectly do the daily check in if I wanted to but the quotes are amazing they are motivating!,This app is one of the best journal apps I’ve ever found and trust me, I’ve tried literally all of them. It’s simple, yet so detailed. I love the daily prompts it gives you. The only thing i wish they would change is that you have to pay for some features, and it’s pretty expensive.,I have ran into this app very randomly when I was just scrolling in the App Store, and I read the positive reviews and thought: hey this would be nice to download! \\nAnd so I did. Everything was was great so far! I typed in my name, picked out my theme...but then it asked for a Subscription!\\nAnd I really didn’t want to pay every month...so yeah.\\nI really don’t want to ask for much at all and this is really the app’s choice but, I would re-download this if it was free :)\\n\\nThank you for reading have a good day/night 🙂,When there is no one to talk too this app has helped me in many ways, I love writing and reflecting about my day, people don’t always stick around to talk or to listen and this app is a sage space for me to talk and write all I want with no judgement!,Keeps me making sure my mood is good, I get quotes throughout the day and they make me feel more determined. There\\'s a lot of quotes and you can be able to check in with how your feeling. Reflecty is there for you when nobody else is.,It made me go from Sad to happy! It feels nice to write your feelings down and not keep them in! It also gives you daily quotes that make my day!😊If it wasn’t for Reflectly I would probably be crying and keeping my feelings inside!! Thanks Reflectly!,Yeah you read the title i love this app it gives me motivation through my pretty hard life and makes me smile even during the rain and its fun to see how my day was going two months ago and others times as well,When I feel sad happy or down I do a mood check in and it helps me clear my mind and helps anxiety a lot I recommend trying it because it’s for everyone so please do yourself a favor and download it 😉,I loved the old way of the journal entries being special little books that you could open. I miss the daily QOTD and the notes you could add at the bottom. Since the attachments are now just stuck over the notes it’s just there and there are no title photos anymore:( I used to totally love the app but the new update got rid of the things I’ve loved the most and it’s not even allowing me to write anything anymore.,I got this app thinking it was going to be a simple writing how you are app but it wasn’t!! It gives you reminders of positive messages, it lets you check in your mood too. I love this app so much and if you want to download it, DO IT!!,I started Reflectly a few years ago, and just picked it back up. I feel a lot better about things on my mind because of these simple questions. Thank you to the creators for making this app ❤️❤️,Tho I want to write my thoughts in a  hardcover Journal..  I know people will go threw it. Or my hand gets very tired. On here I can type for as long as I want :) and no one tells me stop typing I’m bored I don’t want to here ur story =“),I was journaling a bit then it asked me to pay. I couldn’t journal anymore until I did, and honestly, if you want your app to get the full five stars, maybe make it so you DONT have to pay. To be honest, it’s sort of disgusting. Because this app was so nice. And would probably help a lot of people, but in stead, it’s like you have to pay to be happy.,I love this app! It is so helpful for venting or just a daily mood tracker. You also don’t HAVE to buy the membership which I think is great. They also have night mode which I really like! Over all definitely worth a download:),This app is very useful for me but to get to do more on it you have to pay money witch on most apps you do but you wouldn’t think that this app would because there’s not much to it and one thing about the payment it always pops up on your screen and you pay $60 I recommend the app but the payment is to much,Its because if i want better quality i have  to pay and i don\\'t think that thats nice just because the fact that you cant to a-lot of stuff because it is always telling you you have to subscribe,I have been struggling with really bad mental health and wanted to be able to freely express my feelings. I seriously thought this is going to be it but with a broke 13-year-old with no money in her account doesn’t have the time to spend $24 a month to talk to a computerized robot. I’ve seen this app pop up on money social media platforms and saw many good reviews but once I saw the trial notification I was truly upset.,It’s easy to forget what our values are and what direction we head in, especially in stressful times. This app helps me keep a close eye on my goals, feelings, and overall strengths and weaknesses as a person.,I’ve been looking for something like this and it’s perfect so far! Not to much and not too little (: I really cannot wait to see how the journey unfolds and to have help with organizing my thoughts. It’s hard but I think this app is capable of a lot!,I love reflectly I log on everyday and put what I’m feeling to get my emotions out if I’m having a bad day. It calms me down and it makes me feel better about my self scrolling through all the little quotes they have. If you have a lot of bad days like I do I definitely recommend solid 4 stars! 🥰,I’ve been using this app for a long time because it was good for my mental health. Over time they’ve started reducing the amount of free features, which is already disappointing, but now I can’t journal AT ALL without paying for the premium version. it’s sad to see an app that was genuinely helpful turn into a scam, but y’all are better off finding another journaling app or using the notes app on your phone to write down your thoughts.,I have been enjoying this app so far. The free version is ok but I have more fun with the premium. I like the prompts and the daily inspiration, and how you can customize how frequently you get notifications, if any at all.,Overall this is a really good app and I love it but I have depression and you have to unlock it like pay to unlock it and depression is the number one cause of kids killing them selves like I’ve tried many times and this app has helped me get out of it but yea overall this is a good app I just wish the depression one wasn’t locked,This app helps me think about the good things that have happened in my day. Makes me feel better about myself and the day! 5/5 would recommend to family and friends,I really love this app except for one thing. When i try to click no thanks to the offers, it wont let me go back to the app since I’m on an iphone 11. Please change this to an “x” at the top so i can actually use the app.,This app is good to have and it is good if you need to let something out but don’t know who to tell. For me personally I sometimes forget to write but if you turn on your notifications then it will remind you to!,It’s a pretty good app it help you feel happy when  your down and gives you quotes/advice that can help you life even know it wants you to pay you can click X or say no thanks for me I don’t know about you.,The things that look like they really help you are not free, but at the same time it is a good tracking device to help you stay consistent and see statistics about your emotions and inner mental health which isn’t something you come by much so I do love the idea of the app but it’s one of those things that are only as helpful as you let it be,They are basically my therapist I write down my moods and how I am feeling there. And it makes me feel safe. Like someone actually cares. A really cool thing is that they put some inspirational quotes and you can look at new ones everyday!!!,I havent used the app too much yet, but it has gotten me to write more things down than I have ever before. So for that I am grateful. So far it’s a cool app and I believe it has potential to continue to help me in the future.,you know i’m kinda disappointed. i downloaded the app , expecting it to be like what it said on the description ,\\n\\n“be prepared for stress relief , reducing anxiety & depression in your life. your self-care and mental health should always be a priority.” \\n\\nwell that obviously was a lie.\\n\\nthat is only IF you have the money to pay. \\n\\ni understand you need money to run the app or whatever , but for a mental health app ?? seriously ?? cmon now.\\n\\nwe want to journal for our health and for our well being , but we obviously can’t do that with you constantly asking if we want premium.\\n\\nno i don’t want premium! i want an app where i can just write and not worry about paying for stuff.\\n\\nthis app had potential , a lot of potential actually. but still terribly failed.,This app actually helps me a lot I’ve been through some things and just need to vent but without people knowing so I use this app and it has made a difference in the way I talk to people and handle things,This app makes me confess how I truly feel and it just makes me so happy. If you are having a hard time confessing or being your true self or having a hard time finding your path, get this app. Trust me!,It’s a very nice app to have and use everyday, especially with school i get kinda stressed and it’s nice to know i have a little quite to push me through the day. I can also express my feelings with just writing which is nice:),This app used to be really great! But now you have to pay for everything. I understand needing money to be able keep the app up, but I can’t do daily check-ins anymore because I need to upgrade my thing, however that requires paying money. This is a personal Journal to record stuff. I used this as a coping mechanism back when I first started using it. I’m not going to spend money on a virtual Journal.,I’m feeling pretty down but I don’t want to talk to people, and I don’t want a diary because people like to snoop. So this is a good way to share my feelings without anyone knowing and no one can snoop because I have face ID passcode on. Love it and I do recommend!,It’s amazing! It helps me everyday. It has amazing quotes and awesome ways for me to express my feelings. I don’t have premium yet but I hope to get it soon.

It keeps me grateful for the things I have and get to do. This helps to realize that even on the worst days you can find something bright.,Wow, what a wonderful app! I love how it helps me write down what I’m feeling. One suggestion is, maybe have less cost money? I know that for me, as a young teen, I might not feel comfortable asking my parents to buy me something for an app about emotions. Thanks!,I love this app, but you have w to pay for stuff and I don’t think people need to pay to be able to help their metal state some people can’t afford it, if you reading this and want an app that is 100% free and super helpful download Mood App you can do more stuff and is all free!,This is something that I really recommend if you have depression, anxiety, or any mental health that affects your mood. I have been tracking my mood and it has helped me and show my therapist when I am feeling like this and where.,The app itself does run a little and the premium features are slammed in your face however, I do think this app has made me feel less stressed out and in fact motivated me to be even happier with myself.,I just got this today and it makes me feel more better about myself already. The fact that it makes you look at quotes and you tell it about your day makes it like your talking to a friend.,It’s really useful and calming to write out things, but it would be even better if you could add nots to pictures and voice memos and pictures to check ins. But it’s still really good and i recommend it.,i wish you didn’t have to pay to be 38% more happier as the app says plus that just makes you worry about what if you accedentally payed! \\nplus it’s a lot like 48$ a MONTH\\nbut it’s nice to have something to help me stay calm and happy,I feel that this app is like someone who you can tell anything that you need to get off your chest but they can’t judge you! You don’t have to fake a smile for them! Be honest and watch your growth. A total 5 starts FOR SURE!!!,This helps me with my anxiety because I never wanted a diary because my sister I’m always nervous if I get one then she will go through it so this helps a lot with her not being able to see it,i am in love with this app it really gets me and it gives great links to help with your anxiety please get it if your stress or anything it also asks about your day and how was it. It even lets you look at some nice quotes and best part it’s all FOR FREE. Love this app!,It is free btw, tap the x in the corner of it says to pay. When your done setting up and it asks you if you wanna buy premium stuff, scroll down and click the “no thanks” button. Hope I helped! :],I love that I can relieve stress and find out what are the things that I hate and love and more with this problem that we have going I really think that this app should have mostly everything free but it’s fine,Reflectly is so helpful when I’ve had a bad day I just get to tell something about my struggles and they will understand and ask no questions it also gives me a lot more confidence with the inspirational quotes,Your guises app is awesome because I struggle with some stuff and it actually really helps because you see a quote that no one else sees and it’s also really motivating because some people struggle with some stuff and I deserves 5 stars,Although you have to pay for premium, it’s quite good. I feel the need to check in everyday and it makes me feel genuinely happy doing so. This app makes me feel some other way. Thanks.,It really is amazing because it’s like a diary but I can’t ever keep up with it so this is much better and more efficient for me and it helps regulate my mental state and it helps me let out all my emotions so 5 stars is only fitting,Helps with  my thoughts and helps me feel a lot better just logging feelings. And telling how I feel. Totally recommend because it makes me happy to do this and makes be feel weight lifted off my shoulders.,I feel like it’s very limited what you can do. And I understand they need to make money but i feel as if they can give you more activities without the premium then they do,Reflectly is honestly an amazing app. Yes you do have to pay for some stuff but overall it’s really good. Most apps make you pay for the whole thing but with reflectly you can actually use a lot of the stuff!,I have been using this app for like I have no idea it’s a really good app even though most of the app you have to buy things but otherwise the mood check inns and voice note they are really good,I use this everyday and it feels really nice to write my bad thoughts done so then I just forget about them. This app has helped me so much in the past week because I’m getting things off my chest and it feels amazing!!,Thank you so much for the support cause for me it’s nice having someone to talk to when the times are upside down but even if the time is upside down I can atleast make it a bit better with you \\n       (: I’m happy...,This app is great! I used the notes app a long time ago to write about my anxiety with COVID, but when my bestie recommended this app, it changed me a lot! I love this app so much and I recommend this app to anyone who struggles with anxiety, depression, etc! Great app! 5 stars 😄,Day 1 of using it I see myself being happy and  having a great time I feel like if your losing yourself this app is just for you or for anyone in your family who needs it,This app really made me feel like I had someone to talk to so it made me feel really nice like I could talk to someone and I wouldn’t be lonely anymore even tho it’s on my phone Bc I always feel alone and like no one is there for me :),It really helps with venting, it makes me feel good once you get all of those emotions out. Although it’s not someone responding with “ok” and things, it’s better off where nothing is said. I recommend this app.,So far I’m pretty happy with this app. It took me a long time to find a journaling app I felt like I would actually use, but I love all the features and have found myself super excited to sit down and journal with it.,Reflectly is such a great app and helps you through a hard day to open you up and make you feel unstressed. I feel that Reflectly is really calm and make you feel like you are a great person on a very big earth.❤️,It’s a little sad that we have to pay for quite a bit of stuff, but it’s honestly not a lot! I love Reflectly! It helps me write down my feelings without fear of someone laughing or knowing how I really feel. No ones else finds out what you write and it’s really amazing. Three cheers for Reflectly!!!,I have very bad issues with my anxiety but this app had helped a lot one thing though in the check in they could add a little more to it but otherwise it’s amazing,This app is amazing has a 13 struggling with mental Heath and insecurities it helps except I have a issue I have to pay for writing done my thought at first everything was all good but after a few days I can’t write the question of the day and that made me upset because they gave really good questions,I don’t have much to say other than it’s a pretty good journaling app. I’m a child who doesn’t feel comfortable venting to people in person so I usually vent to random strangers online but this app is very helpful and I’ve already gotten a lot off my chest:)),I loveeeee this app it’s amazing and helps boost your day and makes me feel appreciated and I would definitely recommend this to a friend the only thing is that you have to pay for somethings but it’s soon a great app!,i downloaded this app almost a year ago and enjoyed it at first, but recently all functionality is locked for basic users. it’s no longer a freemium app, but purely a paid subscription. for an app with a focus on mental health that’s marketed towards teens & young adults, locking existing users out of their content is shameful. many of the people you market to cannot afford $60/year for a premium membership & taking away a helpful tool from someone struggling with mental health is a sure fire way to worsen the state of their mental health. this cash grab shows that this app doesn’t truly care about mental health, but rather profiting off struggling people during a time of hardship across the world.,I had this app in February 2020. It was great it’d ask you how you’re feeling how your day was and then let you journal about it. And then it’s ask you a little personal question and you get to know yourself... but hen I stopped journaling, and now that I came back and rediscovered it in January 2021 I can’t even write anything down without paying??? And I’m just like.... Okay?????? I have to subscribe and pay money???? To JOURNAL???? Ummmmmm.  ........??????????????,This app helped with my anxiety and my depression by motivating me with quotes! It also helps solve problems with family, friends, etc. I really recommend this app for others if they get stressed a lot and need some motivation!❤️,Once you understand how to set everything up using it is quite easy, even setting it up is easy! And the quotes and daily reminders always make my day.,Even though somethings cost money most things don’t you quotes and get to choose what times it can send you them you get to do daily check- ins anytime you want and a lot more.,It is really good to just write something down but the one reason I did not put a 5 stare is because you have to pay for some stuff and I find that kinda annoying but if it did not have that it would be awesome,It works perfectly for my bad days and I\\'ve been using it for one day. It does not pops up every second adds to buy things and it increases my motivation for the day.,This helps with what’s on your mind and anxiety becauseyou could express your feelings. And it keeps it between you. But you do have to pay for some stuff but you don’t have to.,I love how it sends u quotes, but I think they should send quotes based on what your feeling or what ur mood is. It’s not like it helps u with what’s going on or gives u advice. To be honest it just checks in like it’s supposed to. And since I don’t have people normally doing that it’s very helpful.,This app is really good it helps with my mental status it also talks about things that could be bothering you or things that you feel are goo. I would recommend this app to everyone!,It has helped me so much to keep track of my mental health. Writing it all down in the moment and then being able to reflect back on it is amazing!!! Super helpful when it comes to inner work and realizing patterns.,Fun and actually helps me make good habits for myself, so I highly recommend downloading this app. It’s free but if you want you can pay like $20 for monthly subscriptions if you want more advanced stuff.,I haven’t even had it for a day yet I love this it help with all the stress I’ve been through and the quotes are amazing! I even made a simple one and put it in my pictures! I recommend this app!\\n\\nI can’t see my status yet but it’s still one of the best apps I ever had!😁😙✌️,This app is so great when trying to convey your feelings, but I wish that instead of advertising the app as free and then saying you have to pay for it just make the whole thing free. Some people just want a place to vent and having this app is amazing but when you have so many restrictions on it, it’s kinda stupid.,Reflectly really doesn’t care about helping you anymore, it’s just like any other app that just wants to make money. You have to pay for literally everything now. It’s asking me to pay just for a check in. There is nothing you can do except read quotes unless you pay for it. It used to be where everything was unlocked but now I’m definitely going to be using a new journal app. Thanks a lot, reflectly,The reason I like this so much is because when I’m sad I don’t like to talk about it and so my boyfriend knows to grab my phone and look on this app so he knows what has happened that day for me,This app is beyond amazing! Yes you might have to pay for somethings but otherwise they give you the essentials for free! Lately I’ve been down but now my life is so much better thanks to reflectly🥰 thank you so much reflectly!!!,This is the only thing that cares about me for once I finally feel d for this app gives me so many notifications just to check up on me I recommend it so much,I absolutely love this app and the prompts that come along with it!!! However, I wish the free option had at least a password protection option, as I don’t think faceID is always to most secure option. Other than that I absolutely love the app,This app gives me a chance to think about why I’m feeling a certain way. Also you can get a good amount of stuff with out having to pay!,Reflectively is good but a lot of the stuff is premium which makes me upset I shouldn’t have to pay for something that’s supposed to make me feel accomplished, and some of the quotes can be repetitive even if you choose a different category.,I’ve had this app for like five minutes.... I’m already in love. A great feature is the quotes and inspiration that it can send you throughout the day! I’m a dancer and this will come very handy for me! 10/10 recommend this app!,I love the app it’s helps just write things down in my head like thoughts that I just have to get out and it helps because and I know what I’m feeling when I write these notes,This app is very good, it’s useful as a journal and I really like the concept. Only thing is I wish a few more things were available without having to pay. Still a great app though!,My friend introduced this to me, and I was interested. Once I downloaded the app, I feel better now using it. Other apps are just not enough, but this one is like someone talking to you. And helping! 5 out of 5!,I think this app is awesome, it’s like me telling a person my personal problems. I can trust this app cuz this app can’t tell anyone what I am going through, this app is more then just an app. it’s like something I can fully trust🤍,This app is definitely the app for you if you are looking to spend ur money to be happy. But be sure that this is the app for you because I had barely 5 mood check-ins and it had something “special for me” where if I didn’t pay I couldn’t do mood check-ins anymore.,I love the app, five stars but... I feel it promotes the premium version way too much! It has built on ad banners and other things related to that. I love the check in reminders though!!!!,For people who are down like are I’n a breakup this app is for u and other stuff the thing that’s bad is u have to pay for it u have to buy premium to get the loneliness quotes if they made this whole thing free it would’ve been way better for people.,Really helps me get my words out I’m not to good with speaking and making sense but I can type it out and get it out of my system and the quotes sure have the best ones exactly when I need it,I just got it yesterday so I can’t say to much but so far I love it! You don’t need premium to use the app. There’s a lot you can do without it! Which is great since I can’t pay for it😅 I even has nice quotes! I really love it!,It helps slow down and feel in the moment. I’d recommend it to people going through a rough patch or if you have problems with days mixing together.,Okay so, I LOVE THIS APP\\n\\nReflecty is a very calming place, where I can reflect and tell reflecty about my life struggles and over all my day, the character is really cute and the whole ✨aesthetic✨ of the app is so calming and refreshing! \\n\\nThank you for making it!,Just not the best I’ve used for journaling. I used a different journaling app last year that actually encouraged me to write. The other app allowed me to attach photos to my entries as well; that’s helpful for gratitude practice for me and visualizations.,I love this app! I am only 10. It helps me when I get lost in my thoughts! And that’s not always a good thing for me! I got this app because I have a hard time telling my friends and family my problems!,This app has made me feel so much better about myself! I downloaded it yesterday, and I feel amazing! I love the quotes so much! I read them all the time, and it’s an amazing app! Keep on doing what your doing Reflectly! 😁👍,This app used to be such a great and calming app. It used to help me with calming down and give me motivation. I went on for the first time in a while after having a horrible day and found that almost everything in the app costs money now. I thought they were an empathetic, helpful company, but they are nothing but money-sucking leeches. Don’t download unless you want to be disappointed.,I have been using this app for a LONG time. I checked in this morning to journal and it says I have to pay. They want $5 a month just to write out your thoughts. It used to be free unless you wanted the premium version where there were little quizzes and stuff. This app has REALLY gone down hill. It helped keep me stable and now with the new update it won’t allow me to use it without paying. Trash,This app overall has helped me a lot, I’ve been going through some things that’s I can’t really tell to anybody else and it feels good to have an outlet without receiving other people’s pity.,I give it a 5 star review because it’s a good way to get stuff off ur mind if ur sad about something or mad about something. Great quotes! Like I said its great to get emotions out of ur midn u don’t want or something that u may feel guilty doing! Its a great app!! I DO RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THIS APP ASAP!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️! ❤️❤️,This app is amazing! You get to tell how you feel and how your day has been. It even had inspirational quotes and more! I rate this a good 5/5 stars! If I could I would rate it 10/10 stars. Download this app!,I have had this app for over 2 years and I love it. It helps with my anxiety and depression and it makes me feel better. Thank you to the developers because you have helped me so much,It’s great but why do you need to pay for some things? I just want to be able to keep my thoughts and everything without having to pay for it! Come on, can I just have good mental health without losing money at the same time?!?,great app. i love it. i just want one thing changed. can the voice note be an actual voice note like leaving a voicemail per say? i really don’t get why it’s called a voice note if it just types what we say. we could do that on our own by pressing the microphone icon in the bottom right of the keyboard. please consider letting us actually record our voice when choosing to create a voice note. it would be greatly appreciated. and this would make the app perfect!!,I love this app! I plan to journal about me EVERY day! Although it’s kinda sad how there’s a premium version you can buy, there’s still many options for you to enjoy! 10/10 recommend!,It’s very calming no ads so far and it helps me throughout my day. It is convenient bc if your feeling upset ab anything you can write down your emotions without talking to someone if your not comfortable 👍🏼\\n\\n10/10,The app is very good, but you have to pay for almost everything. I downloaded the app mainly for the stats part, and after I “unlocked” my stats I had to pay to see them. Overall the app would be better off if there were way less in app purchases.,I love this app it’s helpful and also very convenient I do the checking every day But I wish there are no premium I hate paying for apps Thanks for reading I hope this is helpful,recommend if you have anxiety, and it really helps when your having a bad day. Has tons of quotes that are great. only thing is whenever I open the app it asks me to get premium, not that annoying but still. Overall it’s great,It gives me motivation to start every day and the quotes are everything! \\n\\nEven without buying the premium subscription they offer the all is still awesome!,Sure there is premium and what not. But other than that it’s pretty chill. So if you wanna get it. The go for it i guess. You are your own person and I can’t tell you what to do.,Its an amazing app and it really helped me... and then it forced me to buy premium for mood check-ins. Mood check-ins were the only thing i was using and they helped me a lot. But, for some reason they turned into a premium feature? Its a great app don\\'t get me wrong, but its only a great app if you have premium.,Ok I don’t know about you but whenever I’m stressed I always go on Reflectly and calm down. I think it being in my routine has helped me in my life on many occasions. In conclusion I think you should download this app.,I’m going to keep this short. A few days ago I wanted to start off 2021 good and keep track of my feeling and thoughts. Reflectly was perfect for this (not only because it was free) and at first and I loved it. After 4-5 days of tracking my mood everyday it said that to keep using the app that I would have to pay. The Bottomline is this app was and is great if you are willing to pay for it.,I downloaded Reflectly just to try it out and to help me wind down and it helped me reflect on my mood and I love the motivation thing we’re it says quotes and it can give you notifacatipns of quotes and i love thay it does that! 5 Stars,This app helps me so much, I am a every anti-social person but I love sharing my thoughts and day with others! This app helps me share my thought with someone without making me feel uncomfortable!,It gets me through my days and if I have a really bad day I can just scream at my phone and put it in the app I think you should get this app just to document if you had a good day or bad day are you OK day,I’ve seen many ads for this app and I’ve gotta say I’m not disappointed. Just the idea of being able to evaluate on my day is already making me feel better.,Very easy to use and you do not have to pay to use it although yo unlock more options in your motivational quotes you will need to pay for premium but that is not necessary:),I love this app but the only problem is that I can’t buy the offer so I can’t journal like I could when I first got the app. I have really bad anxiety so journaling helps me. I’m just not aloud to buy the offer.,It’s a pretty good app for motivation and everything but you have to pay a lot of money for stuff that isn’t even worth that much. But after all it’s good for journaling and much more!,This app allows you to do so much self-reflection!! In moments of stress and despair, this app really makes you feel heard and helps you understand yourself. definitely recommend:)),I can get out my whole life into this app the only thing is it does show you the ad to upgrade many many times and limits what you can actually do in the app a loooooot,Reflectly is actually fun and so positive. I love doing my check in each day and unloading photos! The quotes are all so good!! I recommend this app as someone who has depression and anxiety. It’s overwhelmingly great even if you don’t pay!,I’ve used Reflectly for a while and up until recently I had no complaints, but now I can’t view my Check-Ins because the main page is just a grey square, and the only way to contact support is through Facebook messenger. No thanks. Look for an app that works until Reflectly decides to fix it’s app,I got this app thinking it would be life changing. I wanted to come out a new person. I got a few mood checks in, and it was telling me I had to pay to do more. I’m a very emotional person, and my parents can’t afford real therapy, especially with my moms cancer and stuff. All I wanted was to get better. And I can’t. I have one person who’s holding me to this earth and even they can’t help at times. Thanks a lot.,I’ve used this for twenty four hours so far and I have found that I am enjoying it as it is helping to get some of my thoughts and feelings written down in a much easier way!,Refectory refreshed s my life because I get to let my feelings out on this app it’s amazing and just please read this\\n, if you are always thinking oh wow I can’t ever let stuff out to my family ,try refectly,When I first downloaded this app I could write my thoughts, rate how I felt, and such and I was satisfied with that. Overall I wasn’t too interested in the other features that you had to pay for, and now I can’t write without paying, which is disappointing since the only reason I downloaded this app was because it was a set spot that I could write and rate my day for free.,I downloaded this because I’ve heard of it on tik tok and I really like it because it helps you with your problems and is asking why you feel like that,The app is so good, but you have to pay for some things. Personally, I’m not gonna use my money, but the experience without everything is still amazing.,First couple of days was awesome and I loved it but now I can’t do anything, it won’t let me do a mood check in or see morning motivation unless I get the premium. Which is just not in my budget.\\nNow the only thing it’s good for is seeing quotes but even with that I don’t get to pick very many options on what type of quotes I want to see...,I like Reflectly so far it seems pretty helpful when it comes too the basics of organizing you’re feeling but it does seem too REALLY only do the basics not very many options,I love this app so much and here’s why I have a lot of anxiety and I suffer from depression so this app whenever I want. To say something to some one or just let something out I can and it’s such I great app I really recommend just try it and there’s no fees you can have a subscription but YOU DO NOT HAVE TO you don’t have to have a subscription it’s the best app ever 10/10 recommend,I was really into this app before it said that in order to keep journaling I HAD to upgrade my account & pay. I figured the free version just didn’t have certain features & was fine with that. But after journaling for three days, I was starting the habit, and it said that I can’t keep journaling unless I pay. Very frustrated.,This refectly app really helps! I love it so much because you get to journal in it and everything,but there is a problem,i think everything on this app should be free because this app is for mental health matters. Thats all!,This app really helps me with stress and helps me get though the day when I am stressed or mad or just feeling down. All it’s quotes and the check in’s help me a lot to keep track of my feelings. this app is amazing,I like Reflectly,what I do is make a reflection of how I feel and why then I like to look at the quotes it helps me calm down a little by seeing the quotes and getting something off my chest when I’m upset and angry I say this is good for people who needs the extra support.,I haven’t had the app for very long but I like it being in my phone. The app almost feels like an outlet or a casual friend that you can talk to. Definitely well designed.,I love this app!!! I like how it sends me little notifications it’s like a little spice to make my day even better:)! I also really like how I can track my day . I find it oddly satisfying to complete the little test. :),This app is amazing! I definitely recommend it’s I think it’s a great reminder to be you! If your ever feeling down you can go on to the app! It has a bunch of inspirational quotes and more stuff like that!,For a free app, I really enjoy it. It’s like a best friend you can always rely on. The quotes calm me down, and I like to confess how awful I feel sometimes. If you need something to talk to, this is definitely the app!,This is amazing I used to have major stress and this app has helped me get through all of my stress plus my problems and all of the things that where in the way of me having a great life.,Hi. I’m writing this review because I think this app is amazing. All of my bffs had it so I wanted to try and can I tell you this app is AMAZING!! I expected something wayyyyy less good than this. If you’re reading this review, give reflectly a try 🥰,This app is sweet and simple. It helps you journal every day multiple times a day. You can reflect on yourself and set daily goals. All the right things to help get you on the right track in life.,I love how you have a space where you can speak your emotions. It’s also private and the cute overall and simple set up makes it easy to use. So far, the free one does wonders,I love this app I have used it for a week and it has shown amazing results there are no problems with this app you don’t need to pay to do anything on this app like most apps I love it.,It’s nice to write down what is going on in your head. The app is very aesthetic and simple to use. I feel encouraged to write down what I’m thinking throughout the day as well as tracking my mood.,without premium it doesn’t help, but with premium it’s amazing!! as a teen having to go through school and a pandemic my mental health has been very bad. this helps because everyday it gives you a notification with a quote and you get to journal and answer self reflect questions as well as reviewing your progress. i normally don’t stay on track with these kinda things but this app helps you stay on tract!! premium is totally worth it. 🍄,Ive only had it for 2 days but the first day I was down. The next day after I saw a quote i felt appriciated the rest of the day, definitely going to recommend it to my friends.,I really like this app, it’s really relaxing. It gives you motivation, quotes, and you can just write down your thoughts. definitely recommend this app if you really need someone to talk to, or even if you just want to get into some good habits :),Honestly I could never keep a journey even tho I tried but this is way easier but I wish it wouldn’t spam the buy premium things,Great way to reflect on your day, you can actually do that multiple times, you even right a reflection of why you feel that way. And it reminds you that bad days are totally fine, they help you acknowledge the good days.,Its fun but i feel like there here for money cuase basicly you just write your fellings and what happen not much but there here for the money and prob like to take what happend do not write PHONE NUMBERS OR ADDRESS cuase there here for the money not to people,So I am one of the many people who don’t write reviews but this app has helped me more and I feel like I can express myself without being scared that anyone will find out,I really love this app it really helps you understand yourself but it costs money and usually i dont spend my money on apps you get five days free so i enjoyed my five days but if you aren’t looking to spend money then I wouldn’t recommend but overall i would give it three stars :),It’s a really good app because I feel like there is finally someone listening to me who won’t make fun of me and I feel so much better because I can get out what’s been bugging me.,i personally don’t have a strong enough relationship with my parents to tell them how i’ve been feeling the past few months. and i definitely don’t have enough courage to tell them i might need a therapist or just someone to talk to. this is kinda a heartfelt review i guess, but this app makes me feel supported. i have no one else to talk to so i can just pour all my feelings into this app and not be judged at all.,It’s really nice how simple it is to use, just would recommend that you don’t have it suggesting to buy the expansion so much. It’s not a lot but maybe tone it down by half.,This app is so friendly there is a option where you can link your fingerprint on the app so nobody can get in if you want to write personal things on it!,Overall, it’s a useful tool. I enjoy having an outlet to write and reflect, and seeing that in a timeline. I do see improvements for the UX/UI though, and opportunities to expand on content that would be helpful to upload.,This app is overall really good but...there is just one thing I hope it could do.  That thing is help with anxiety and stress because I get a lot of that but I think It’s a good app overall that! Your very much welcome for not making this a long speech!,I think that the app is awesome, and I love using it. But if I ran this game I would change the premium pop-ups to a setting do you don\\'t have to keep kicking the \"X\". Thank you for reading. Also it isn’t fair that we have to pay to get almost all the stuff (that is better).,I love this app because it can track my mood and track my progress of my mental health. I recommend this app because you can right how you feel and it’s private.,I think that is a good idea to do a digital journal, because I prefer to type rather than write because writing for too long makes me tense. I love the positivity and relaxed vibe and I think it is a very good app.,I have very low esteem in myself and I have no one to reach out to so I have to write everything down and this really helps me it’s the only last thing I have hope in,Reflectly’s design is simple and intuitive. I was honestly getting into it, but then I got slapped with the “subscribe to continue journaling” feature after writing five entries. I’m not willing or able to pay a monthly fee for it, and by taking away the main functionality of the app for non-subscribers like me, I have no reason to keep it around.,I can plan and tell reflectly what I have done today and it’s awesome and I always tell it everything even if it’s super private and it keeps everything a secret no one can see,It’s great, like any app they try to push the premium version on you any chance they get but other than that it’s a great simple easy app to do daily check ins,I can’t seem to log into the app, it says my email is invalid, when it’s not. It makes no sense, but it seems as though maybe the email recognition software needs to be fixed. Please fix this because I feel like I could really use this to help me keep track on my mental self-improvement.\\nIt might also just be with me, so maybe the Reflectly team could help me out.,I was having a great time with this app and enjoying it A LOT! Then it started telling me to buy a premium version of the app. I got mad and just did some mood check-in’s instead of the different daily things.,I’ve had this app for like 1 hour and I already feel so much more content I really really love this app. it’s a good break from social media and super calming I recommend to literally everyone <3,Honestly for me it’s good self therapy but it’s just utterly stupid that it makes you pay for everything but other than that it lets you write whatever you want and you can make your own things and stuff so yeah.,I’ve been needing to start a journal and this was the best option. This is an amazing app and its runs perfectly. 10/10 would recommend,When I got this app you had to pay to use its best features but it was still really good I spent months writing on this app and I left and returned some months later and now I can’t access a single thing this app was great but unless you wish to spend money to just write thoughts just go elsewhere or write in your notes it’s never worth the money,It was so fun to see my happiness and sadness in a phone. Although you could to pay for some stuff but your allowed to just skip. It’s like a Diary that no one can acces except you and you can write down all your feelings,This app is really helping me through these tough times especially since I have no one to talk to about these things. The inspirational quotes throughout the day helps as well,Helps keep track of my mental health and is a very good way to cope with things and just right something out with privacy,Today, I downloaded the app. I opened it and immediately felt very comforted. It is simple and smooth, which makes you feel still and calm. 10/10.,This is probably the best app for inspiration and expression I love it. New quotes each day and new questions that really make you think 10/10 definitely recommend,When you join, they will give you an offer for only $20 per year. It’s usually $60.,I\\'ve been on this app for one day and feel as though i\\'m speaking to a best friend! The app is very welcoming and all around fantastic! i 12/10 recommend this to anyone and everyone!!,I have suffered with depression for around 4 years, and this app made me a little bit happier, and now all I finally get to look forward to something everyday!:),I want everyone to know I have been using this for 4 days and so far it’s working it’s like someone giving you a big giant hug! If I could rate 10 stars I would!😁,I love this It helps me a lot its like your dairy but it helps you and you can put a password on it to keep your account private from people who goes on your phone.,It’s really helpful for my mood and you can set it up so you can have a password but to have the whole thing you have to pay like $20 with a discount each year so that’s annoying \\U0001f972🙃,Nice interface. Would like to change some of the options or at least let me write in melancholy.,It’s helped me keep track of how I felt say...last week. Like I can remember how I felt and makes me realize how big those things felt only for me to be laughing abt it now. Anyways, I love it.,I really like the setup, but for $60 a year you really could just track this yourself and look up some quotes on Pinterest. But if you’re unmotivated and depressed, this is makes it really easy,I’ve been looking in the google play store because the App Store doesn’t have recent reviews and realized that this has been happening for everyone. I can no longer write my Reflectly. I have been using this app every single day for over a year and now I can’t write my Reflectly and I am devasted because this is a daily thing for me, Reflectly PLEAse please please please change this.,I used to love this app. I’d always vent and write down everything I wanted whenever I had nobody to talk to. I was about vent but it told me I had to pay to use it?? This app used to be the best, but I guess I don’t really have a choice. I miss when it was free and I would just write down anything and know that nobody else could see it and vent when nobody wanted to listen to me. Just please change this.,It’s a fine app but I don’t have money as a teen without a job and all I want is for this app to help my mental health but no! I have to pay!!! And would my parents pay for it? No!! I just want to express my feelings and just feel better someday. I don’t talk to anyone about my feelings and honestly I thought this app might change things. Im disappointed.,Best app ever but I cant get any contact support and some stuff in quotes you have to buy them and I really don’t like that but the app is awsome and if your reading this you should totally get it!!!!!:),I love this app, it is so convenient if you are feeling down you can download this app and show your feelings and it makes you feel better :) love this app 5 stars,I give a five because its a amazing app where you can text personal thing and to calm yourself, Reflectly is like an online someone who talks to you. when your bored you can talk to reflectly!💕💕💕,This is the best app ever !!! 😊🙃 (*^ω^*) you can reflect your feelings and it’s kind of like a digital journal.

Anyways I hope u enjoy this app!,It is wonderful for people who have anxiety depression adhd ect but it helps you understand yourself so much better,This app has really helped with my depression and I love it. I look back at 2020 and think to my self wow I’ve really grown. You guys can grow with me! Just download the app and get started with your new journey 💖💖,If I could rate this a two and a half I could. This is overall a great app, but the majority of things I can’t do without paying a monthly fee. I get that the people who made this app are doing this for a job, but I can’t even do pretty much anything anymore. I don’t even think I can do daily journals, and I used to be able to do that.,Reflectly really helps those who have mental health struggles really gain some clarity into themselves which I know always makes me feel really collected and calm,I love using this app to track my moods, but i’m a little upset that i have to pay to do so. Either way it does not get in the way much and I can still use the app!,It’s like your at home therapist! Right before I go to bed I make a story about my day. And it helps me become more relaxed and relived before a day tomorrow. I would without a doubt recommend!,I like this better than jour because you can add photos, use voice recordings, and set multiple reminders!!!,I love this app so much! It helps me pour out my emotions. I can tell this little guy everything! I used to be so close in because I had nobody to talk to. But i don\\'t feel like that anymore.,The problem is this app does help in way but after using it for 2 or 3 days you have to pay in order to keep using it, I deleted it immediately after finding this out so honestly don’t even bother,I love this app but the only thing is that I keep getting pop ups for subscriptions which I do not want to but I would just like talk about my day and not buy anything but otherwise this app is amazing!!!,I think this is a cute app to just fill out when I think about it. I’ve been told that I need to do better with keeping track of how I feel throughout the day and this is helping me a bit :),This is a fantastic app for anyone who needs to get stuff of their chest or express any emotions really!! My only request is that we get a yearly or all-time chart in addition to the weekly and monthly!,I love the app, it helps me with my daily mental health check in’s. And I feel like I can put it out there because I know that the robot isn’t just going to yell at me. Though options are very limited if you don’t have a subscription so it’s not as enjoyable as it could be.,this app started off great but it took a turn. this app helped me cope with a lot of things but when i got on today it tried to make me sign up for premium. and said i couldn’t continue journaling without premium. i hate this because i liked having my own little journal in my phone and now it’s gone. thanks a LOT reflectly.,After using this app for some time, this supposed free app is telling me to pay to keep using it, without further explanation. If the app is going to charge for for a simple journal entry or photo upload, at least let the users know beforehand of this sudden change. Extremely frustrating.,I love the app. Its the only journaling app i really like and its helped a lot with stress and its easier to vent than bottling it all up now. But tonight i went to do a check in and i have to pay ? Why do i have to upgrade my account to vent my emotions? This app has helped soooo much but now i have to pay $15 to even write a paragraph? Thats dumb.,Reading the notes and titles just made the memories comeback and coming back even more then I just kept thinking about it again and again and again and every time I look at it again it made me feel worse about myself and breaks me down,I love this app it so useful and really helps me. It is free for the most part except for special offers. Overall I definitely recommend getting this app.,I love the idea of the app, but it doesn’t really help me. I have to pay for things that might help me a bit which I’m not going to do because it’s pretty expensive. The only thing I can really do is use it as a diary which doesn’t really help at all.,I only had reflectly for one day and i love it it really help me with my problems that i have and makes my days better than any other days,Keeps track of my mood and the things that cause anxiety, happiness, sadness etc. simple tool to reflect on what things make you happy and what things cause stress in your life.,Please get this app, it is amazing and it gives motivation and self love quotes. I use this app twice a day and I definitely see a change for the better in my daily life.,i just started a few days ago and i actually find this very nice! i like the daily challenges they put cus in competitive, it helps me stay in the challenge and usually i get through it! thanks Reflectly!,When I’m stressed about something, I feel like I finally have someone to talk to. It’s like a diary, but on my phone. I rant all the time there, and I haven’t told anyone I have the app.,Okay so this is a really good app. I feel like I am able to talk to someone when nobody is listening to me, cause nobody ever listens, and it’s nice to have something to talk about, and write about my day :),I wish you didn’t have to pay to get certain things on the app. I understand they want to make money, I personally don’t want to have to pay 60$ per year.,You used to be able to write journal entries for free. The only thing you really had to pay for was the stats and extra daily questions. But now you have to pay to be able to do anything in the app. Journal entries are no longer free. Why? At this point, it just makes more sense to write your journals on paper or in your notes app.,I’ve had this app for almost a year now, and I’ve never been disappointed with it. I have the free version and I love it. It’s calming and very customizable, I recommend.,It truly is but I wished there was more interacting in this app like you know, getting up and moving and suggestions for what to do today. 💖💖💖 Other than that it’s awesome,Love it.

It jusT lightened my day the first time I tried it. So I recommend this app.,It’s great app, it helps a lot, just why not have a one time low pay, or just free! It would be so much more helpful to anyone’s mental health if the app that’s supposed to help them, was free. Not needing an annual pay, causing more things like anxiety.,This app has gotten me through so much! I’m 12 and I don’t have many people that I trust enough with my feelings; this app let me get things off my chest that I needed to say.,I have been keeping somethings all to myself when I need to let them out.

Now I only get to write a main prompt and can’t even answer the daily question. It’s messed up. Only for money now. 😥,This app is amazing, today I had a good than bad day but the Stuff they send you makes you feel better I love this app and you should get it!,Title.

I have only used it a little and I already love it. I have lots of thoughts throughout the day, and Reflectly somehow helps me organize them.,I got an offer for a premium membership but I don’t want to pay for the app. When I click “no thanks” it won’t let me make anymore journal entries until I buy it. I wish I just could continue writing in it without needing to pay :( really ruined the experience for me,What a scam you have to pay to be happier. But the stuff that you have to pay for are the things that you mainly need help on. All you get are quotes and write your feelings. How trash is it that you have to pay for essential therapy needs. I’m going to find some better apps made by people who genuinely want to care for my mental health for free. ✨DELETING✨,I expected more from this little app from such awesome reviews. It really is just a place to track your mood and answer little prompts. The interface is pretty and it does what it does well. It would be great if it offered more personalized insights or deeper reflection opportunities.,the new update is so unfortunate. you can’t change the dates anymore so if you make a journal a little after 12 it’ll count as the next day, you no longer have cover photos, you can check journals for individual feels and activities etc, you can’t look at the journals for specific dates, you no longer have daily questions, (for regular users at first), and most importantly you can’t favorite days/ journals and or view them. incredibly disappointing, i used to love this app:(.,It’s like you have your own little friend/buddy to talk to about what’s going on in your life.

It seems decent enough. I guess time will tell right.,I LOVE reflectly! I feel calm around Reflectly,I feel secure.

I think if they were gonna do that they should have said it in the beginning or at least had warning,I’ve used this app for about a year. I ended up taking a break from it and when I come back, I have to pay a subscription just to use it!! There’s no point of having a journaling app when you can’t even use it with about paying for a yearly subscription.,When you first get it, it’s a great app. But after a couple days, it will make you buy something. It’s overpriced and if you click on ‘no thanks’, it keeps popping up. If you wanna pay 15 dollars a month for a app, go ahead. But if you just want to use the notes app in your phone to do check ins, it is not the app for you.,Reflectly gets me away from my stress and struggles. Reflectly makes things easier in my life, it makes things easier to share and I love that!,I used to love this app, but now it’s just way too greedy. You cannot do ANYTHING without paying now, it may as well not be a free app. And it would be one thing if it was something inexpensive but they’re trying to charge you a ridiculous amount of money per year. Unless you want to waste your money, find something else.,I had some major problems that I could get through my self but this app helped/is helping me!!!

Is a awesome app I recommend it too you if your reading this it’s a awesome app really good,I wish premium was free because some people could use it and need it if there very down. Like they should make it free so that they don’t yknow. Possibly harm themselves. This app has helped me a lot but I want premium,This app helps with anxiety and you can just get all your feelings out so you don’t have all this stuff on your mind to worry about,I love having a friend to finally listen to me but it really doesn’t help me at all.

But other than that it’s a really great app!! ♥️♥️,It’s a great way to just cool down or write your feelings. It’s helps when you don’t have anyone to talk to and you just want to say what you are feeling,It’s ok, yeah you can write about how your day and how you’re feeling about it, get a few inspirational quotes here in there, but overall to really reflect on it and look back at it you have to pay for the premium, and I’m poor😂😅,I like this app because it helps me a lot it more not help you but it helps me if you download it it would mean a lot to my thx,I paid for the subscription because there’s so much going on in my life. I thought this might be a way to sort through it. After paying for subscription, I can’t even access everything. The daily quote has been the same since the first day. I’ve tried to “swipe up” to change and can’t.,It feels amazing to have reminders,motivation,and be able to journal if you have problem like overthinking I highly suggest this app,I have bad anxiety and ocd and this app really helps me cope when I have no one else to vent to.\\nI definitely recommend this app for anyone who can’t afford therapy.,With this app i can really know how i am truly feeling and with the mindful quotes it helps me get the motivation to keep going.,This is actually a really great app, coming from a teen.

Free use was cute and simple and really all I wanted was the graph and journal but apparently the really free part is you can look at a couple quotes and that’s it.,Okay, I’ve only been on this app for 5 minutes.

I wish this app was free so it could be more accessible to everyone, and not just people who have money to BURN!!!,I have been using Reflectly to keep track of my moods and mostly journaling, but now I have to pay money to journal..? it was convenient for me to just use reflectly because I carry my phone not a book.

Don’t get this app unless you have $20+ just laying around.,Amazing app but absolutely horrendous customer service. Takes 2-3 days per response. Per. Response. Doesn’t matter what the response is, it’s going to take days. Simplest questions take days before a vague response is given and then days more for it to be a complete response.,I though there’d be a free version of the app but you have to pay to do more than five entries. Also, just a suggestion, maybe don’t make the advice for mental disorders a pay thing? Just saying.

I didn’t know that I had a limited amount of journals so I kinda just did them whenever I wanted to. I’m a little sad too that there aren’t that many quote options that are free. I’d be great if you could select multiple types of quotes so you could get them all in your stream and personally, I think the sections of quotes that are sensitive like eating disorders should be unlocked for ppl who have that and don’t know how to get help. Honestly an overall great app and the price with all the discounts isn’t really that bad. I just wish there was a way to unlock stuff with like time or activities so people who can’t pay can still get all the qualities of this app. Because I’ve maxed out my journals, I really don’t know if I’ll be able to use the app anymore because I don’t have the ability to pay for now. Later, I’ll update and see where I’m at if the free journals come back or if I pay for it.\\n\\nUpdate: after looking at other reviews it seems this app was better before the update. I didn’t know the app before, but I know that the way it is is asking for so much money that I cant do a simple journal entry. I’ll probably have to delete it and find a different journal. It’s such a good app but everything is locked :(\\n\\nUpdate: there are plenty of other journal apps with a basic unpaid version that seems to be better than this one’s, so I will be using those instead. I’d rather not have to spend money to do something that should be free like writing. Hopefully the people who made this app can think of a more friendlier way to help people and earn profit.,I downloaded this app a year ago and it was really good. Now I have to pay for premium just to write an entry??? May as well make the app cost money..,I couldn’t make it past the paywall even just creating an account.

The clean, aesthetic design and the little clicks when you finish a note really help to incentivize mood-tracking. \\n\\nThe only thing I would want to change is some of the user interface. Specifically, setting up new activities/emotions is awkward; instead of having to archive them if you want to make any changes, I feel like you should be able to edit the ones you’ve added in your settings so you can change the name or icon. I also think it would be nice to have the option to change the icons for pre-existing activities/feelings, or even archive the ones that aren’t relevant to your life. FINALLY! I think you should be able to choose multiple categories for the quotes you can get, but that might just be in the paid version, I’m not sure. Because of all this, I’m rating it a four out of five stars. This is a beautifully built, satisfying app, so these little issues end up standing out. \\n\\nI also have some suggestions. The lack of these features isn’t detrimental, but I think they could go a long way in improving the app. First, it would be great to have a simple goal tracker. I’ve seen these in other journaling apps and I can’t help but want them on your app. It wouldn’t have to be much, just a simple list of goals, maybe you could go in and press a button to say if you’ve succeeded. A second suggestion — you should be able to write quotes to yourself! I find the pre-existing quotes don’t really work for me, and I would love to write myself messages that I know I will need to hear in the future. \\n\\nI will also say that I think the price of the full version is a little much for what this app is, but since the free version isn’t too restrictive and doesn’t have ads, it’s not something I’ll complain too much about or take away stars over.,It really helps me focas and in class iv been gsting good grades cuz of it!🤍🌱,I like it it’s very calming!,this app is amazing and has helped me so much with starting to overcome anxiety,Agree with me,im just putting 5 star so i can get the acheivment,It’s so amazing!,Helps me with my social anxiety,Big sad,at first it was great, but i have to pay for premium in order to write journal entries. which is stupid. i understand if premium cuts off some things, but journaling is the whole point of the app.,Pretty cool I guess,It dosent even help and it only does help if you pay 😒 terrible app,ILVIT,I can’t get off the premium page,i may have accidentally spent money on it tho,I can’t add any more entries because the app tells me to upgrade!,Idk,Cuz it doesn’t give advice,that’s amazing it helps me calm down and is encouraging it’s just very nice,this is an amazing app that i actually use!,The app concept is great but the app gets boring,Very calming and helpful to relieve stress,It’s like a diary, that talks to you..,I don’t like how you have to pay for it,I have this and it’s good.,it’s a really good app it helped me to check in and keep my mental health good,lol i used to use this during quarantine as an outlet because i was at rock bottom and had nobody to talk to and i redownloaded and now 15 dollars a month.. to write how u feel?? online?? very sad,This app is so great I love it,I love this app,It’s pretty pog,i love this app!,really good app. i honestly recommend,Very helpful!,I love this app,Hello developers of Reflectly, \\nI’ve been using your app for a while, and feeling Hello developers of Reflectly, \\nI’ve been using your app for a while, and feeling little bit more better managing my emotions reading positive affirmations, check in my recording my mood, and so on and so forth. Some things which could be improved is include more emotions, and unfamiliar emotions when logging to check in with how you’re feeling. There isn’t good selection of moods or emotions so I would appreciate if there’s a feature to record down the emotion or add way more moods, and unfamiliar moods. \\n\\nAnother one is many developers who makes apps includes subscriptions, and I appreciate the discount to pay per year. I think it would be more fair if there’s one time payment that’s not overly priced, and affordable, there are people still out there who can’t stand subscriptions, and instead of complaining I use the free features, and it would’ve nice if you include a one time payment which is affordable to get access to all the features. \\n\\nOverall it’s a well built app, although I like to recommend the developer if we could customize, or add our own images we get from the internet to our own liking for positive affirmations, and customizing your profile where every iOS users sees an image of their profile picture, and other wonderful things on the app. It’s a really well made app and I’m glad there are people who actually cares for peoples mental, and emotional well being.,HS helped me a good bit,I love this app,i love the app it has helped me a lot,the app is amazing but is it lagging for anyone else or is that just me? the app seems to run really slowly.,Cool, I like it so far!,This is a great app!!

I understand making an app takes a lot of time and dedication, and I only rated this two stars because up until three days ago I loved this app. It made me feel productive and more relaxed once I went over my day. I LOVED IT. However, I guess with the new update, now we have “limited space” to journal. That is really frustrating because we already don’t have all the features for free, and now you take away the free journaling altogether? That’s pretty lame. I don’t want to spend $59.99 a MONTH just to have an app about journaling. I understand you need to make money as developers but come on! I loved your app because it provided a good service FOR FREE, and now it doesn’t. Simple as that. Get this app. Go ahead. But just know time is going to run out and you’ll have to pay to journal with no perks. I loved Reflectly, now I hate it. Come on developers.,I’ve been using this app for about a week now, and I love it already. The look and feel of it is really nice, and I just generally love the aesthetic and all the little things you can do with the little emotes in mood check-ins. However, I wish that reflections weren’t locked behind a paywall, but I do still love the app though, especially the reflections. I love that it gives you a more specific question to think about and write something about that isn’t just “How are you?”, and I wish I could use it more because it generally puts me in a better mood.Overall, love the app and would recommend, even if just for keeping your thoughts straight like I use it for.,First, they charged me $30 for a premium subscription when I first opened the app. (Quick background, I\\'m a 32 year old engineer and understand how to use an iPhone, but still somehow accidentally paid for a year long subscription.) After two days of not being able to use the app, I was finally able to create an account and log my first journal entry. \\n\\nAs soon as I finished, I was offered a \"special deal\" for a now $60 premium subscription marked down from some even more absurd amount. After turning that scam offer down, I was finally able to use the app from the main menu. Only to find out that I had apparently only paid for a basic membership, which I was under the impression was free. That\\'s when I noticed the \"just for you\" button with a heart at the top of the screen.\\n\\nWell, just for me, was another offer for a premium membership.... This time a little cheaper at only $18 for an annual membership. Clearly this raised some concerns so I found the settings/menu of the app - which confirmed that I only had a basic membership, contrary to my credit card statement that clearly shows a $29.99 charge. I immediately went to my subscriptions through my apple ID to see what that said and, of course, it showed that I have a premium account. Go figure. Now, not only did I have a premium account, I had a $60/year premium account. That was the final red flag for me. \\n\\nI\\'ll be filling a complaint with the app store and immediately notifying my credit card company of this fraudulent charge. \\n\\nI came here for help. I\\'m extremely disappointed. I strongly suggest not submitting your mental health to this.,Good,The good things about this app:\\n\\nThis app is like a therapist but without talking to someone if you are shy and is super easy. My life is very stressful but with this app it makes me feel so much better. There are quotes that are so amazing and can sometimes make your day! \\n\\nThe bad things about this app:\\n\\nYou cant see your stats before 4 to 5 days of checking in to this app and telling it how you feel.\\n\\nBut over all this app is AWSOME!,Therapeutic,I got a deal on the premium for 14.99 instead of the 59.99 I think they should offer more for that price,The app advertises an in-app discounted subscription for 19.99 then bills 59.99 to your account. I\\'m working in filing a charge back now. I did not authorize a purchase for 59.99. WARNING: FRAUDULENT APP.,I wish this app was free or low cost because I really need it for my anxiety and as a helpful journal, but now it has you paying $30 a month or $59.99 for a year! What a scam. I had it downloaded for a while because I forgot it asked for the premium plan, yet it still sends me notifications like crazy!! If these issues were fixed, it would be perfect!,I would recommend this to anyone with depression anxiety or ocd maybe even adhd it is so nice and it’s free!but if u want premium access it’s a little expensive.otherwise it’s amazing 😩✌️🍓don’t forget tpwk✌️,This app is nice but no way it’s with the price tag,I really like the app and it helps me keep track of how I feel, I just wish it would let you use the whole app without buying a membership because I shouldn’t have to pay just to help my anxiety and depression.The app could be better if I could use more of it but overall it’s  okay,The app says it’s free and the reviews would say the same, but in order to continue past the welcome screen you must buy the premium version for $29.99. There’s not even a short free trial, and once you reach that screen you can’t go any further. I love the GUI but I’m deleting it since I can’t even trial it before paying.,This app is amazing. I don’t get stressed or any of that but just for something to write out how i’m feeling and look back on it to see what i need to work on is amazing!!! I use the free version but it gives you a discount instead of $19.99 a month you can get $1.79 a month for premium! I don’t think i need it though the free version is all i need!,GissgjstidtuztiztiIrstizfoxypztiOtTp,Swaggyyyy,Okay so I wrote this review to share because I have A LOT of anxiety paranoia and insecurities basically I am a messed up person and I honestly found this app and I downloaded it I feel honestly great because it allows me to share my feelings and it makes me feel like I don’t have to hide it anymore making me feel better, if you have any anxiety depression or anything else i suggest this app! It really helps and I think it deserves 5000/10 stars but I really hope this review helps some people who struggle with these things like me :)! Have a good day and I appreciate you reading this and whoever made this the developer thank you!!,Ahhhhhhhhhh,i honestly don’t know why people would rate this lower than a 5. this app helps me explains my emotions and helps me with my depression and anxiety. you can set it up where it sends you motivational quotes throughout the day, and those are my favorites. they really make me feel special and important. 100000000/10 recommend getting this app! won’t be a waste of your time.,this app said that i will get 1 week free trial of the subscriptions if i cancels the plan before March 20th and if i purchase monthly it cost $1 something after registering by email, but why they charged me for $21.59?!! ridiculous,I didn’t get the premium access because I don’t usually spend money on apps, but even so, I’m glad this app doesn’t bombard me with adds like most.it’s been helping me a lot with stress and my anger, i recommend.,It’s seemed like a very good journal but I download it thinking “it must be free right” no I download it ready to write how I feel then suddenly it gives me a free trial and I have to buy it! I am mad because it never said anywhere that I start with a free trial then having to pay $30.00?!?! Unbelievable.,This app is very helpful.I now feel calming,peaceful and creative.This app is a big change in my life I LOVE THIS APP!!!,Its a good app!I wish there were more free stuff tho.Like when the app asks you “where do you see yourself in three years” those things are cool,This is like the best app ever to track and keep a record on how you feel.Love it! Would give 💯💯,I was offered $19.99 annually but it charged me $59.99 that’s false advertisement,It’s like having a friend to talk to. It’s so relaxing and I really love this app. Thanks for this app. 100/100 ✅😀,amazing app, helps me to understand myself. i can write the deepest things in here and i know it’s safe. 10000000/10,It’s not worth the time.You have to pay for daily reflections, along with most of the other features.I have only found two or three things that you can do on the app without paying for premium.It feels more like a chore to me, and doesn’t help my mental help whatsoever.I will say the mood tracker feature is pretty good, but that’s about it.,It’s cool............................bye...................bye...............is u still here...................................………………............ok is u stalkin me or sum!?!?,I opened this app today to try and help with some thoughts I had. I started to fill out the questions and then found I had to pay $29.99 for premium access (apparently it is usually $59.99 which is ridiculous) but as I got to the full register account, it said I already had one! So I figured it out and when I logged in, it said I had a deal for the premium to be $19.99. That seemed fine enough for me but turns out they charged the first $29.99 AND THEN the $59.99! I was already a registered user and they used that opportunity to screw me over. I contacted their support (which went through FaceBook Messenger) and surprise! I have yet to hear back.,This is exactly like a free therapy session! It is such an amazing app! 100000000000/10!,This app has given me a sense of hope amongst the chaos that I have been enduring lately and I just would like to say,thank you.You should definitely download this app!,yeah,I love this app more then anything!!!!!I love to write down what I’m thinking when I have no one to talk to at the moment .I love how it gives me options on what I’m feeling and why mad even lets me add new different emotions.please get,___      ___\\n         [  *]   |   [  *]\\n                   \\\\\\n            -_____-\\n\\n:),Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome app,This app is cool.It helps me calm down when I’m mad and when I’m happy I can write it down in the mood checking tap,—————————————————\\n\\nNever thought I’d be writing a review but here we are, reflectly let me start by saying helped me through my anxiety. I had anxiety problems since 2020 September, 9, 2020. What involved me into anxeity was because of the 9/11 attack, me being myself I looked up on that day about 9/11 on YouTube. I watched these movies trying to make a remake of the movie, I watched clips and it made my brain at the time feel sad but never scared. That night, I couldn’t sleep I never new why or what it could be cause I can always sleep. I also had no sugar that night, it was strange. I kept breathing heavily but I didn’t notice it, I couldn’t sleep for a long time till I had to take a sleep pill. I was shaking and it was bad. This anxiety lasted for 2-4 days. I tried looking up calming videos on YouTube but they actually never helped me once, not even a little. I this staying up late messed up my beautiful sleep schedule to the point where I almost stayed up all night. It was bad, I was flunking school and on top of it with covid 19 I thought this was the new me. Luckly I never had a anxiety attack. I started looking up apps to help me sleep and then I came across reflectly. I downloaded it then tried it, I started to written my feelings and I saw quotes. They helped me calm down. They also had friendly calming reminders for me when I needed it through the day. I do recommend reflectly because not only did it help my health, but it’s kind of fun! After a few days of the app my anxiety faded away \\nthankfully. Thank you reflectly, I appreciate your help. 5 stars ⭐️.,I kinda wish it had a code as password and not fingerprint so that my parents cant get into it but otherwise amazing,I used this app to periodically journal my thoughts and monitor my moods and experiences so I was shocked when I logged in after a few months to see it was paywalled and now the app is forcing you to pay a 59.99 premium for a journaling app. That is appalling and the price is unreasonable for the service. It looks like it’s time to find an app that is similar to what this app used to be and offers a more reasonable price.,At the beginning, for the first four days it was amazing! But after four days… IT MADE ME PAY! Literally all it is is a little book you can write online. You’re better off buying a five dollar book at Michael’s to write down your thoughts then purchasing the in app purchases for 59.99 a year🤬🤬🤬🤬,I personally love r̆̈ĕ̈f̆̈l̆̈ĕ̈c̆̈t̆̈l̆̈y̆̈ because i feel loved.And like i have someone ro talk to\\n♡´･ᴗ･`♡,No description needed great app! But I have a question for the makers of the app.when you make a new Reason for your emotions why can’t you type a space,I used to be able to write my notes down in here for free but now everytime I try to write them down it tells me to get a $19.99 plan fix it please!!,I just download this app and I already love it! I found it by TikTok and just made a video about it! My TikTok it @petite..rae,I wish I could rate it 10000000000,Gggg,Guuuude,It’s fun but I wish it did something to make me feel better I am not the most precise person when it comes to journals or writing.But this is good if you are enjoy!!,Definitely 100/10,The app itself is very good. This review is in relation to the in app purchases. First of all, every time you open the app you get a prompt to upgrade with some sort of discount. I understand the need to make money, but it’s quite pushy. Moreover, every time I have clicked on one of these “discounts” the purchase prompt shows a price of 59.99. Now I’m not going to make any assumptions and assume that this is some sort of bug. However, if it’s not, this app shouldn’t be getting anyone’s money.,With most apps you can try the basic and then decide if you want to upgrade to premium. With this app, as soon as I input my name and choose a color scheme there\\'s an ad for premium ($29.99/year) that you can\\'t close without paying for it. I\\'m not going to pay that much without even seeing how it works,:) good app 10000/10,I was having an amazing experience with reflectly until tonight when I tried to use it.Every time  I’ve opened since Christmas, I believe, there has been an add about reflectly premium. I have skipped over these ads because I do not want to buy and have no intention of buying it in the future. I skipped over that add today and was about to write a check-in when I then get the message saying something along the lines of “Woah, we see you trying to write so we’ve decided to make something special for.” I believed that this was going to be a nice note or just something sweet for the users but it was actually an add for reflectly premium again, however this time, I couldn’t get around it. I am actually not able to use the app anymore unless I get reflectly premium! If this was you intentions the whole time, just make the app not be free. That way people know what they are getting into. I knew that I wasn’t going to get all of the best features but I didn’t know that after a certain amount of time, I would not be able to make entries. Reflectly has been my way of relieving stress and after everything that happened with the US government, I was looking forward to it. This was just a major slap in the face after I had been having a very good time on the app. Other than that, reflectly has been amazing. It’s very helpful for me and allows me to write all of my things down in my head whenever I want which is very helpful.,They make u pay to write anything now. \\nI truly like the calmness/chill and time line based design of the app. But I can\\'t even use it now. I ain\\'t dropping any money on any app period and for those you were helping, me included, might possibly b feeling dropped off bc we can\\'t do anything. Nothing. \\nI know it\\'s cheap but, I\\'m just disappointed. In my opinion You should have features like at least the \"mood, voice, and photo\" options in the \"+\" tab b free. \\nThis app really helped me express things when I couldn\\'t talk to anyone it put things into writers bc of the way it walks through things- but sadly I\\'ll b in the market for a new free app. That I can use. ❤️\\n2 stars bc u were (past tense) useful to me. And I do appreciate that and that I can look back on what I was feelin back then.,Good \\nGood \\nGood \\nGood \\nGood \\nGood \\nOk \\nGood \\nGood \\nGood,In my opinion it’s a great tool to be more productive in life.it has impacted me in doing more tasks each day ....soo THANK YOU REFLECTYY!!,This app is the best it helps me with my thoughts and get me though stuff it gives me nice quotes and gives me courage to do stuff it gives you messages on the app on what to do when you write down how your feeling it’s a 1000000000/10 For me !!!💕💕💕,Some of the clicks aren’t working.like I will press on of the little buttons and it will not work but other than that it’s good,I wish I could do no stars,Provides easy and immediate access to coping strategies and techniques that users can rely when experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Users are give information to understand their feelings and emotions, as well as ways they can break the cycle of feeling this way. However, forums should be better controlled. Anyone can post anything, which can be hurtful to users, especially teens. Although it is said that the app is for anyone that is 4 years old and older, children that do not know how to read will not be able to use it. Individuals that are visually impaired will not be able to use it either.\\n\\nAn interesting point that was made by Steinberg (2014) is that the pain that adolescence experience when they are social rejected “closely resembles physical pain in neurological terms that taking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, actually can help alleviate it” (95). Being socially rejected is a painful experience for teens that can definitely make things worse for those that are already struggling. Based on the review criteria above and my own experience with What’s Up, I would rate this app a 3 out 5. What’s Up has many different coping strategies and techniques that users can access whenever they are in need of it. However, individuals can post whatever they want on the forums that can potentially harm users.,The most dynamic component of this app is its active forum receiving posts from users every couple of minutes. As Murphy writes in her article on teens usage of social network sites (SNS), “SNSs can be used to help adolescents form an identity…When used correctly and monitored well by parents or adults, adolescents can effectively use SNSs to explore themselves and construct identity (Murphy, 2013, pg. 4). This particular forum site may not be the safest kind of SNS available for adolescents. The purpose of this forum is for users to chat with others experiencing struggles similar to them, and there are various categories a post can fall under like seeking advice, rant, asking for help and other but there no safeguards, like app moderators, in place currently to protect vulnerable population, like teens, from experiencing the negative side of anonymous posting. This can result in further damage being done to an adolescent’s identity formation and the learning inappropriate coping skills to dealing with their emotions.\\n\\nSource: Murphy, L.

It has actionable methods that it walks you through as you do them. It had great positive quotes but that’s not all the app is unlike many other anxiety apps. My favorite section is the grounding techniques that lead you through the five senses. It helps me calm down so much. Thanks so much to the creators of this app.,I was looking for a CBT app that could help me understand and cope with my intrusive BDD thoughts. Instead, I got an app full of basic platitudes and an option to journal (wow so revolutionary). The fonts are ugly, the layout is not user friendly, and the options for help are extremely limited. Go with something like Youper if you’re looking for habit/mood tracking, because this app was just... not it.,I have been struggling with anxiety for a while trying to figure out coping mechanisms when I found what’s up- I got it during an anxiety attack and used the game to help- it was amazing 10/10 recommend this app,I didn\\'t even know there were apps like this and I found this one by accident. It\\'s helped me put somethings into perspective.,The app seemed good, but every time I tried to post something in the forum it would say I needed a valid account. I’ve been trying to create an account by filling in the username section, email address, etc, but when I hit the create button it just gives me an alert message. It won’t create an account for me.,I bought a one week trial period and after one day realized it was not something I wanted or needed. It’s a mediocre app and I didn’t want to continue with the membership after the trial period. No big deal... I wasted $5 but that’s the chance you take in a trial period. I stopped using the app after the one time I checked it out and emailed to cancel that same day and was told I didn’t need to cancel anything because it was just a trial period. The next week I was charged again so I sent another email with no response. The next week I was charged again so I sent yet another email and received no response. The next week I was charged AGAIN so I finally opened another line of communication and got a response that the membership had been canceled and that someone would reach out about my refund. It took a long time for that email to come but when it finally did they gave me the option to have 6 months of a free membership (a membership I don’t want or need) OR I could choose to get half of the money back, that they weren’t supposed to charge me. I am not asking for my trial period money back. Just all of the money they charged after I canceled multiple times. This is crappy customer service. There are plenty of other meditation apps that are better and have more to offer that are free or significantly cheaper and won’t rip you off!,Idk what I just spent $20 on to then ask me to pay even more for what I thought was apart of that “limited on time offer” and the 1st article I read which was about rage and anger already stopped reading after number one because it says to tell him “ you know I don’t like it when you do this” and you statements. As someone who has been in an a hold of therapy since I was young due to depression I know that you’re not supposed to make statements like that especially when you’re talking about an angry situation you’re supposed to make ice statements it makes me feel this way because then you’re just making that person think that you’re attacking them. I will be turning off the subscription I kind of want my money back already. I did really like the sound feature though how you could turn up the fireplace or like the other noises I did really like that. That was neat.,So I had been wanting an app related specifically for realigning chakras and I believe I saw an ad for this one. So after purchasing two separate things which total to almost about $15 I finally tried it and unfortunately I was not impressed. There’s a couple of 7 day courses you can take voiced by a woman or robot, I can’t tell, but her pace is so unnatural and monotonic that it’s hard to differentiate between her and Siri. It actually is so distracting, you lose focus on being in the present and I found myself wondering when it was going to be over. And at the end it just abruptly cuts off after stating to continue to meditate. Totally the opposite of relaxing.I’m not sure how to discontinue this subscription since it’s not through the App Store but I will not be renewing.,The app was directed to me through Instagram. Finally caved in and clicked the link to see what’s it all about. \\n\\nRealized I had to have a subscription to even view most content. Closed out the app without any purchase. Later received a discount for $20/year plan and decided to go for it...\\n\\nTook roughly 48 hours for me to get login information from the support team. Stressful and disappointing. Albeit there was a delay, however we got to a solution. Finally, day three after purchase I could to use the app. \\n\\nThe GUI is ergonomic enough, but there is little guidance offered. No description or tutorials, where to begin directions, you’re just kinda dropped in this meditation box.\\n\\nThe features aren\\'t plentiful, but there is enough to get you going on a meditative road to less anxiety. The hardest aspect to overcome is the narrated guided meditation practice that is voiced by a robotic, mono-tonal computer. Being told to do such and such, think such and such, by an unempathetic robot voice is tacky feeling.\\n\\n3/5 stars. Would use at $20 yearly subscription for one year, unlikely to resubscribe. Would not suggest this app to my IRL associates.,Yo this app is life-saving. On this app mediations dont tell you to think of positive thoughts, or to “just let go of your day”. They give you exercises that help you take a look at your thoughts & I have seen the growth in me. This app compared to the Calm app is incomparable because they actually help you with your anxiety depression and happiness. The world is at its most crazy time right now and this app can save lots of lives. I accidentally bought it because I thought it had a weeklong free subscription… But it did it and it was definitely worth the $70 hands DOWN.,This app is very okay, not worth the price though. I bought it based on the ads i kept seeing (silly me); it seemed like it would be personally interactive like a few of the other apps i’ve liked. I took a chance and was very disappointed that it’s nothing like what was advertised. The meditations themselves are okay- but the robotic voices make it harder to relax when listening. There doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of content, but I’m still exploring (since i’m now stuck paying for the year subscription 😅) and I will try my best to get what i can out of it- but i would recommend looking for a different app or free meditations instead of this. Anything you would find on this app is out there for free, and so much more!!,It would be preferred to have multiple options on sleeping sounds to adjust with the volume bars and not just three, but i really adore that feature itself. additionally, on the white noise sleeping track, there is an audible loop that causes a gap and throws off my relaxation lol. other than those two things, this app seriously helps me remember to focus my breathing and meditate daily for self improvement. the payment is worth it for all the amazing features,Highly recommend trying ANY OTHER meditation app. I gave 2 stars because the sound mixer is the only thing I liked about this app. The voices in the meditations are awful and super distracting. I usually don’t have a problem with guided meditations, but these sound like the person reading them aloud has never instructed a meditation before. The delivery is rough and sometimes hard to understand. The meditations themselves lack substance and don’t really help. There are way better apps out there. My one regret is that I didn’t cancel my subscription before my free trial ended. Now I’m out $10 for an app I’m just going to delete anyway.,I agreed to pay 6.99 for a 7 day trial.  As it were I had some medical issues and never opened the app. Not only was I charged the 6.99, but I was charged for an additional month of use!  I tried to open it to make sure I wouldn’t be charged again and can’t get past a payment screen.  I tried contacting PayPal and can’t get a refund through them.  They’ve obviously got the legalese covered.  PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A REFUND!  I downloaded the app because I had a stroke and I’m trying to keep my blood pressure LOW.    Wish I could create a warning system for others who think this is a safe bet. I’ll amend this review if I hear from the developer personally with a refund.,Saw this app on an Instagram ad, and signed up. Enrolled thinking I signed up for a great deal of $9.99 subscription. What they don’t tell you is that it’s the WEEKLY price. Now I’ve had to remove my bank information from this company’s site so they don’t charge me again and have yet to hear from anyone at the organization about canceling my account. I’ve tried to remedy on my own but because of how I set up the account they never gave me a login, just took my bank details so they can profit off of people like me who got duped. Extremely frustrating and sad. THIS APP IS A SCAM. There are better, more honest apps for mental health. My time with this app has honestly done more harm than good.,I canceled this the same day on January 29, 2020. All I received was an automated response saying will be in touch within 48 hours. No further emails received from company. I’ve since  sent three cancellation request with no response received at all. Today I tried calling the phone number that they have listed with my credit card company, and the phone number is a “out of service“ number.I also found that their so-called headquarters is listed in Cyprus not in the United States. Since they have failed or refused to cancel discharge, I will be filing further complaints with the necessary agencies.,The application is beautiful and well made. The price of $10 per WEEK and still to have locked content was ridiculous for what you receive. When I went to cancel and explain that the pricing had been unclear, the person that emailed me back refused to give a refund (even a partial one). \\nI thought I was paying $10 one time. Even $10 per month would be more reasonable for this application. It has made me wary to purchase other things from the App Store, afraid I’ll be repeatedly billed.,**9.99 PER WEEK** Clicked on thru an ad. Listed as 9.99 flat price, not clear it is a subscription until final page, and even then does not tell you what the renewal period is. It’s not till you get a welcome email that you find out it is $9.99 PER WEEK. Will allow you to cancel but will not refund full price of initial payment even when canceling within 12 hours of purchasing. So lure you in with a low flat fee, and if you don’t notice they rake it in every week, and if you do notice you can’t get all your money back.,I saw an ad for this app online & thought I’d check it out so I signed up for what I thought was a monthly fee only to discover (when I obtained my receipt) it’s a weekly fee. With a one year sub that fee would really add up. I just filled out a cancel request because I have other meditation apps that don’t mislead customers and work just fine. I tried to find ANY indication on the app it’s a weekly fee but could find nothing. This leads me to conclude that this is intentional to scam more money from people. Not cool.,They offered a year-long membership for a couple dollars a week so I bought it but IT CHARGED ME FOR THE WHOLE YEAR!! I don’t even know if I like the app yet because I didn’t get to preview it and now I’m out $70 even though I cancelled right after I subscribed. I’m literally crying I can’t afford to lose $70 right now. My whole week is ruined. I only got the app to try out a test I saw an ad for and I can’t even find that test in the app now. Not only that, but this app is for relaxation and mediation, BUT NOW MY STRESS IS 1000% HIGHER THAN BEFORE!! I WILL UPDATE IF I GET A REFUND!,I have been charged $9:99 and $6:99 on Jan 20 and on 28!! That’s $34 in under 2 weeks!! This is criminal! I haven’t even used the app!! Just downloaded it on the 20th. Kindly ensure you return my money! This is criminal! You want to create more problems for me instead of solving it! \\nMy comment wouldn’t post until I gave you more stars! If I had my way you won’t get any at all!!,Thought I was paying 9.99 one time for a specific personalized meditation. Not only did I not get my specific course (despite multiple not useful exchanges from customer service) but I was also alarmed to discover it was a repeating WEEKLY charge of $10! Thankfully I noticed the charge in my account after a month and was able to cancel but could only get refunded half. So $20 for nothing I wanted. Feels like dishonest business practice despite the nice email responses allowing that 50% refund. Nope.,I sent an email about a month ago regarding the “quizzes” this app claims to have in the ads I always see. I never got a response. \\n\\nI cancelled my subscription and dealt with some billing issues and reached out to customer service again to see if they would be any assistance. Well they were not, just doesn’t make any sense why I wouldn’t get any response. Just a robot telling me they got the message and a human should be replying in 24 hours or less. Sike, they lied.,My biggest complaint is that many of the meditations sound exactly the same, despite the intended use. The meditation courses should also pick up where you left off after you have completed them, instead of jumping to the last session every time. Other than that? I use this app everyday. It’s great!,Liked the app and the customer service was helpful in resolving my issue once they were able to understand the bug.,Nearly everything on this app is locked behind a paywall. I was only curious about the chakras, only to find out almost all the courses require you to pay. That is not wanting to help people, that is wanting to make money. \\n\\nWant some free help with meditation and mindfulness? Download Audio Dharma. They have excellent Buddhist teachers that give daily Dharma talks for FREE. You can donate if you want to help their cause as they are volunteering. THAT is quality.,Very disapoointed. Not user friendly. After only 3 days they started charging me 9.99 a week. (They make it very difficult to read their terms and conditions... very small print.... several clicks to get there) I feel completely scammed. Please refund me the 3 charges of 9.99. If you were confident in your product, you would state up front the terms and conditions. Who ever heard of giving 3 days to review before charging. Shame on you.\\nTeri Medley,Very disappointed with this app. It’s been helpful for my sleep; but it doesn’t allow me to log in, (I’ve tried resetting my password to no avail) and even though I’ve paid for a subscription, some meditations are still locked.,The app was for the most part pretty good . I signed up for a trial  for a specific amount  and was charged 5 times that !! Yes I read the specifics for the trial basis (1 month) and my subscription had the correct amount for the monthly payment ,  however when I tried to contact customer service on several occasions they  never responded !! Very disappointing!!,I revise my comments to: thank them for being responsive and quick.   I do recommend this monthly service, but know you must follow a path for cancellation...it’s not as easy as it could be with a “click here to cancel “ option.,The app advertises “which chakra is blocked” like they’ll assess that for you. I figured I would fill out some kind of questionnaire and then get recommendations on which chakras are blocked with meditations to use tailored to me. That’s not it at all. All you do is answer what you’re looking for stress relief, sleep improvement, and a couple other general things. Very disappointing.,The people who run this app are thieves! They charge you the initial price to obtain it , then not even a week later you get charged again for the same thing!! No where in the “ fine print” does it say that they will do this! I find this disgraceful especially in today’s economy when people really can’t afford to be spending money much less having it taken from them!!!,I was really excited to try to this app out however when I was filling out the basic questions it ask if my goal was to loose weight or to stop overeating. I think these questions could be worded differently to be inclusive to all people since everyone has different body goals.,I was locked out of the meditations I paid for so I emailed customer service twice for help but got no response.  Then I tried hitting ‘restore purchases’ not realizing that it would charge me again for the meditations I already paid for.  I’m still waiting to hear back from customer service.  I don’t recommend this app to anyone.,I never write reviews & this app is a scam. It does not make it clear what it charges you. Then you cannot login to cancel your subscription. You request your login info & it sends you nothing but numbers. You reach out to support & you have to wait 48 hours to hear from someone.\\nI’m extremely upset & disappointed. For a spiritual app .... it’s a scam. I’m infuriated. Stay far away.,I took a online quiz that ended with the offering of purchasing a “meditation plan” for my specific quiz. The next day I received an email stating this was a “weekly subscription”. No where in signing up did it mention a subscription of any kind. I dont care if the app is good or not, I will not support this type of luring of customers. Be transparent in what you are selling.,I bought this app with the advertisement that it was a one-time charge of $9.99 They then began charging me $9.99 a week. Unfortunately, I did not take notice until 6 weeks later. Who in their right mind would pay $9.99 weekly for this! It’s not even that great! Most of the programs are just repeated with a different name, just with a different computerized voice.  Total scam! Beware! False advertisement!,They say the app is for free. You subscribe, and next thing you know... you are paying $9.99 per month. You try to get rid of it... but you have to end up going through PayPal or your bank to be able to cancel it... I just did ALL of these... they said they cancelled it... we’ll see... they are based in Ukraine... not around the block...,I had high hopes for this with where I am in life, but I was VERY disappointed with the narration!  They all sound as if they are an AI of some sort with no “passion” in their voices.  I have tried a few other meditation apps that are FAR better than this.  I tried to give it a chance but if the narrator doesn’t believe what they are saying, how can I focus and believe it myself.,After being forced to buy a subscription and only being able to choose between 12 weeks and a half year I foolishly wasted almost $100 then when I go to look at stuff it wants me to pay even more money this app is a scam and isn’t what it appears to be,I got the 6 month paid $70 to have access for 2 months then I email about my problem they asked for proof I showed proof then they wait 3 months before they tell me I need to contact apple of course apple said I waited to long. So they keep my money and I wasted months thinking they were going to do the right thing,I downloaded the app and instead of monthly charges I have them coming out all the time. I have had several repeat withdrawals of 6.99 and 9.99, which I thought would be a monthly charge. I have deleted this app and I expect to no longer be charged and I want a refund of the overcharges.,I saw an ad for this so I did their quiz and then it said it would charge me $9.99 for results. It tells me I have to download the app so I did. Then it makes me take the quiz again and charges a completely different price. I want my $9.99 back. Don’t promise to help people and then charge ridiculous prices, it’s evil. Please give me a refund.,You’ll download this app for free then get charged $10 every week! What a scam. This company doesn’t care about meditation or making the world a better place, just making their pockets deeper. They send you notifications... but not to take a breath, or to meditate... to give them more money. Do not download this app.,Under no circumstances should you download or subscribe to this app. They charge you $10 or more every week, but hide all that information. Support emails go unanswered. It’s website from your receipt page is full of broken links. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS.,I’m so disappointed with this app. I NEVER pay money for apps, but this one seemed to have a lot of cool features so I went ahead and got it. I have access to like 3 things. EVERYTHING else they want more money for. Nothing that I have seen is great enough that I’m going to dump more money into your app.,I paid $9.99 for the app but was offered a 30 day money back guarantee. The app just didn’t work for me so I requested a refund to only be charged a second time at $9.99 just 7 days later. Only refunded $9.99 once even though I sent an email requesting a full refund based on the 30 day money back guarantee.,There are MUCH better mediation apps out there. Many of them are free, and provide way more features. The quality of the audio is just bad, the meditations are the same every ‘day’ of the program. It’s just cheap all the way around. \\n\\nThis one is charging me 9.99 a WEEK, and the response email from their support team was ‘they made it very clear and detailed’ that I was going to be charged every seven days. \\n\\nI found the app on Instagram, and was asked to take a quiz, the quiz results said I could obtain the custom meditation program for 9.99 and made me\\npay via PayPal. Nothing about a weekly charge.,I tried getting in contact with them many times over a subscription that was accidentally charged. It took them almost 2 months to reply and by that point they could not do a refund because it was “too late”,This program is worth maybe $3.99/ month. A computer voice is a poor choice for the speaker. One 5 minute lesson a day for meditation is hardly worth the money. Very disappointed and Apple won’t refund ☹️,The app is very cool but guys, why did you use a robot voice?? I can’t stand it and for that reason I can’t use it, it bothers me so much!!,Find another app. You’re going to lose money eventually, unless you don’t check your statement and don’t realize they’re charging you for things you don’t want or need, nor did you intend to pay for them to begin with.,I got this app through an ad and was never told of multiple charges in one month. I have yet to use the app and I’ve been charged twice within this month. I no long want this app and I want my money back.,I am a certified insomniac my whole life and started using this app. LOVED it at first until I realized they’re a charging $10 weekly...not worth $40 a month, I’ll find a more inexpensive way to manage my insomnia,Very disappointed to be charged $15 for only a “7 day trial” with no time to even really use the app. It was VERY shady. I have other less expensive apps that use the same features. No thank you for the deceit.,This app charged me $17 for three consecutive weeks. I was under the impression that it was $17 for a one time charge. Nowhere did did mention that he was going to be $17 a week! I wouldn’t have even agreed to $17 a month, let alone $17 a week!,Do not buy this app. They will charge you $10 weekly even after you cancel!,I was charged twice for a week I want my money back and I’m canceling my membership I want my money back now both charges just because you charged me twice,This app is good but no one can afford it. They now have ads on Facebook that redirect you to PayPal and you make the “subscription” agreement with no allusion to how much you will be charged in the future.,New to the app. First thing I listened to was narrated by a female humanoid-like robot voice. It was creepy. I tried to listen a few times and still a no. I’m expecting a soothing, calm, hypnotic voice not an animatronic program. 👎🏼,I did t have time to use it and cancelled it way before the 7 day trial. Even though I cancelled I was still charged the subscription fee. Refund my money!!!,I never writes a review for any app but I must say this is the worst app I ever tried the woman who speak is so annoying and I cannot focus with her she had no emotion she speak like a robot … I want my money back !!!!,I saw this on an ad and signed up. I figured I would try it. Then I was being charged $9.99 and $6.99 every freaking week. It’s not worth that!!! Don’t waste your money. Use any other app.,I don’t know how anyone can find that woman’s speech pattern relaxing or soothing. Terrible to listen to, and while the words she is speaking are good, she is robotic sounding and jarring. Awful.,Very disappointing when you sign up and cancel but are still being charged everyweek. I have emailed and no response,This app is keep charging money from your account! It shows that 9.99 per month but it charged three times in a month!,If I could give 0 stars I would! This app has charged me 3 or 4 times a month with no response and no way to cancel through apple. Garbage scam. Don’t do it.,You pay for the subscription then have to pay for mediation courses in the app. Rip off.,I just wanted to explore the app and\\nBefore I know it, I have subscribed for a year without the option of cancelling.,Once again, we have a meditation app claiming it wants what’s best for you while trying to bleed it’s clients of all the money it can.,Beware.  It seems like you are paying for a lovely app for 9.99 but that only covers the first 7 days.  Cancel ASAP!!!  So disappointing.,No. Just no. This is actually more distracting than the thoughts and feelings I’m running from.,Please do not download it’s a scam. Look at trust pilot reviews. They have taken 38 dollars out of my account in the last 4 days and will not stop.,This app is scammy. Just don’t use it. Not impressed so far. I saw an add on Instagram and I got excited by the chakra quiz, but it wasn’t worth my $10.,Unless you are subscribed you are not getting anything... just move on.,They charged me, downloaded the app and then tried to charge me again,Can’t believe I have to pay for someone to help me. What about for the people with no money?,This is not an app with “in app purchases”, but rather, a subscription based app.,The voice for the meditation is to robotic be mechanical,Don’t waste your money. They charge $9.99 per WEEK! Absurd.,I cancelled it.  Would like a refund.  Just isn’t for me.,Refund me now I never use your app,This app is supposed to help you meditate but the guided meditators have SUCH ANNOYING VOICES IT PISSES ME OFF I CANT EVEN FOCUS,I would like to cancel,Not free,cancelled my subscription when i didn\\'t know it would be $43.99 after it told me $3 a week. apple refunded me but now they have charged me again after i have unsubscribed. ONLY GIVING 5 STARS SO MY REVIEW CAN BE SEEN ‼️ i will be reporting this company to the BBB.,I ignored all the offers for discounts until I was offered $19.00 for the year...but you don’t get much more than the free version...if you want any specialized meditation it costs another $20+ ...I will definitely not renew past my year- The daily posts rarely change from what I’ve seen...It definitely could use some added features if I were to continue beyond this year I’ve already paid for....,I purchased a year subscription on 8/23/2020 for $19.99 and the company charged me $39.99 for a new 6 month subscription in October 2020, which I didn’t catch then and a renewal of that for 6 months $39.99 in April 2021. They are insisting their records are correct, despite the photos I have sent them indicating otherwise. They have effectively stolen $80 from me and are refusing to refund the unauthorized charges.,This is an absolute scam. I was charged a different price than the website quoted for a 50% off deal. I never used the app and emailed to question the charge. There resolution was to cancel my subscription after never using it and then say they were sorry but do not give refunds. Nice! So I paid $21.99, for what, for nothing. I just lit $22 dollars on fire. Poof! Wish I could give no stars!\\n\\nUPDATE*** I was asked for my automated email response number for this issue. I’m not sure where I send it to or who I get in contact with due to the developer comment not explaining that, so I will just place it here on my review. There was several back and forth emails and I have all of them still. The request number is 1312700.,I used to like this app when I had it on android so I decided to get it on my new iPhone.  It had been awhile since I had it but was excited to use it again.  Long story short this is the most boring app I’ve ever had the displeasure to use, and I guess I didn’t cancel the free trial in time so I got stuck and locked into a 6 month agreement 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ I paid for sixth months of basically an app that is nothing but complete ridiculous nonsense.,You do not get what you think you pay for it just directs you to buy more programs very misleading and disappointing.Now I get an email stating they never got my review hopefully this one will go through. I’m trying to figure out how they did not get my review but they could email to tell me they did not get my review.,App doesn’t give you a choice but it doesn’t deserve even a 1 star...\\nI love this type of app, meditation and the music, peacefulness it provides. But the charges made for this app are outrageous. I downloaded the app on 4/7/21 and paid for it. The following charges from this app have appeared on my bank statements.\\n\\n4/7 $6.99, 4/7 $19.99 plus a processing fee of $.20. On 4/24 another charge for $28.56 plus a processing fee of $.85...,it gave me the option to pay $2.69 at once and cancel later. before i even tried the app i got a charge for $70 and customer service won’t refund me or contact me back. their only reply was that they can’t make it free because it’s a good app?\\n\\nmy case number is 1142983,I saw reviews calling this app a crook and I took the chance anyway. DON’T be me. They charge you two different fees WEEKLY and then don’t accept your password that you’ve made to allow you to cancel it. Don’t allow you to change your password to an already existing password and ignore emails about asking to cancel and rape your card account until end of times. Biggest app scam ever.,I payed 20 bucks for a year. I switched phones downloaded this app and it would not allow me to log in at all. I tried to switch my password but i was getting no emails. The peoples voices are very annoying and he said” try not to think about any negative or fearful thoughts” like are you dumb mentioning that makes someone think fearful or negative thoughts it was harder to sleep. I did enjoy some of the breathing exercises but i didnt need to pay 20 bucks to find how to breathe. And theres YouTube videos for free doing better than this app.,I requested cancellation of my subscription and received an email from Support where the sales person tried to convince me to keep the app.  I again asked for my subscription to be cancelled so that the weekly payments would stop.  \\n\\nWhen I requested a refund because I confirmed not once but twice to cancel my subscription I was informed of the below statement from support@betterme\\n\\nSure it looks like I’m getting 3 months free but I’m sure the charges for the app will start again at a higher rate.\\n\\nFor those of you using the app and Enjoy - but for those who download the app just to test it out — BEWARE!\\n\\nConsidering the situation, we would like to offer a solution for you. Your plan is going to be renewed on 2021-02-07 for the next week. We would like to prolong it for 3 months with no additional costs. This way you will be able to give the app another try and experience all its benefits and advantages. \\n\\nKind Regards,\\nTeam BetterMe,I’m mostly doing a review to ask more different levels of the paid version. I don’t want/need every thing in the fancy version, there are just some sound options I wish I could have. I’d be willing to pay (reasonably) a 1 time fee to get the extra sounds. But right now the only option is a 1 yr subscription that includes a bunch of things I don’t need. Others may, and may they enjoy the option. However, it wouldn’t surprise me if there weren’t others who would be willing to pay a smaller 1x fee for a partial upgrade rather than the $60 for everything that only covers 1 yr. Also, would love more low pitched sound options. I rather like the brain scan sound that’s on 1 of your other apps.  Positives: really like the flexibility in this app, particularly the timer. Works great as a. Reverse alarm clock.,Been using this app for a long time, I like the music and there\\'s very good recordings of nature sounds which helps me fall asleep. I just wish the music didn\\'t loop so soon, would have liked the songs to be at least 5-10 minutes long. Also, I would have liked to see more frequent updates with new music and sounds but it seems like they discontinued support for it.,I love that I can customize my meditation modes. Thought I had purchased the lifetime years back but can’t restore my purchase. It’s worth it though being able to customize each mediation to the sounds needed to sleep better or put you into a receiving mode focus.,I have loved this app for several years, having used it strictly for the white noise function. Now I can’t access some of the sounds, such as brown noise and pink noise. App says it’s trying to download them. Never does. \\n\\nI’m pretty confident the developers can help, so I’m putting this out there. Thanks for your time!\\n\\nSteve,I love this app so much. I upgraded to premium months ago and the isochronic tones help me sleep so much but I keep getting a message that says “some of the sounds are not downloaded. Download them now?” So I click yes. But they won’t download I keep getting the same message. PLEASE FIX THIS😭🥺,It helps me sleep and makes beautiful sounds. One problem I’d that for some cool sounds and mixes, you must get a subscription which means paying. But other than that, there are many things to use for free!,I’ve been using this for years. I have recommended this to many patients. And And have use this when attempting distraction and relaxation techniques with critical care patients,I use this app all the time. It helps mask sounds wonderfully.  But also provides soothing background noise to help me sleep. I just love it!,.,I love this app. I get to custom make my meditations. It is definitely iteky worth giving it a try.,This app is pretty decent. But, the whole “pro” thing is stupid. Half of the good sounds you can’t even unlock, and the ones you can unlock aren’t good sleep noises. This whole thing is just to get your money. Don’t buy it, you’ll regret it.,I use it with my clients and while at home. Very soothing.,Had this app for years, never failed, never crashed. Great tool to relax!,I love this free app. Helps us sleep when our thinking keeps us awake.,Already Great and keeps getting better,Great app. I highly recommend it!!,I love this app been using it since I was like 13 highly recommended,Lots of free options for combining relaxing sounds. I love it.,This helps me get good sleep while I am on the road for my job.,The sound just puts you on another plane of reality,Bait and switch. I bought this a few years ago as a lifetime member. Now many of the features I liked are now available as an upgrade. No customer loyalty. Buyer beware,This app has helped me with my sleep and calms my mind.,You’re doing great! Keep going! Thank you for the gifts.,Puts my mind away from everything else great senses,Cool app with allot of features with different sounds to help you mediate,I love your stuff and I Even take the classes on there to and i love yall,So amazing keep up the amazing work!,So I purchased the pro some time ago and it’s telling me to purchase it again!! It also locked the stuff I had saved, beyond mad!!!,Nothing to complain about. It rocks!,The ability to choice what works best for YOU to relax!,This app completely drains my battery on my iPad 4 when used overnight. Never had this issue on other devices.,Must get!,Good,Me encanta, todas las noches la utilizo y me permite dormir tranquilamente.,The review button on the site is broken and users are no longer able to update old reviews that we have written or leave new ones. This problem started about 2 weeks ago. I have emailed the app about 6 times over this period, but nothing has been done to fix the problem. \\n\\nI am in the habit of listening to new meditations and then leaving reviews (which are never negative) so I know which meditations I have already listened to, which I love or merely like. I enjoy reading the reviews of others as well. So the fact that this review button is not working is a problem. \\n\\nOtherwise, I love Insight Timer. I have been using it for 3 years and 3 months and have clocked over 10k minutes of meditation. The topics are varied and interesting. I bounce around a lot to new meditations based on the topics I am working on in my life. I find some of the meditations to be incredible and in the style I enjoy and others to be just good, in my opinion, but not my style. That is why the review button is so important, so I don’t unintentionally begin a meditation that I have already listened to in the past and just found to be ok, but unmotivating to me.,Insight Timer is by far the best meditation app available, I’ve tried all the top apps and nothing compares. Most of the other major meditation apps are focused on selling you hardware or a subscription - Insight Timer is free and has additional content you can pay for but it’s not built as a “money machine” the way the others are. Plus, there are legitimately excellent, experienced and trained meditation instructors like Tara Brach who post free guided meditations to get you started. My only “complaint,” if you can even call it that, is that there is now a TON of essentially worthless “woo-woo” visualization exercises and “healings” posted by an increasing number of “meditation teachers” who clearly have no training or credentials and are just using the app to build an audience for their personal brand. It didn’t used to be like that, but now it’s common to see three pieces of new-age nonsense for every one actual guided meditation. I worry a bit that beginning meditators would easily get sidetracked down an endless rabbit hole of “mind candy” and miss the core point of meditation - training the mind to be present, empty, and completely open.,I really love this app. I’ve been using it for several years now, paid and unpaid, and it does not disappoint. I have tried other products and they do not work as well. Unlike other consumers, I do not want a social network, I want a sleep app, and this one absolutely does the trick. The problem is data collection and an utter lack of any privacy rights, including third party giveaways. I was completely prepared to renew the paid version, and then I fully read the, in my opinion, wholly illusory “Privacy Policy”. \\nHowever, I have requested opt outs and “shine the light” under the California privacy rights laws TWICE and I have heard nothing. (I understand that this app uses Google Cloud AI; there are cookies that can stay in place for two years. This, it seems, has added to the value of the app due to automation eliminating costly pesky customer service.) Now, perhaps other people are just hunky-dory with giving literally all of their personal information out with no limits, but I’m not one of them. I’m waiting to renew until I hear something about addressing my legal California privacy rights. (I’ve read in other places that there is little customer service for this app and I believe it.) Just do the right thing.,Truthfully, there is no better app for meditating whether you are just beginning your journey or have already found and are simply improving your zen. You’ve found the app you are probably looking for. The guided meditations are my favorite because my brain has a habit of wandering off to things I need/want to do later, maybe a conversation that already happened, where the person is going whose loud car just drove by... so listening to someone else guide my thoughts into focus by following my breath is EXACTLY what I never knew I needed. They have tons of instrumentals you can choose from, which I have used before and practiced yoga or just worked on something with it playing in the background. Oh my, and endless sleep sounds like will knock you ouuuuut. The actually timer within the app, I honestly probably use the least. So, if you are on the fence about if this should be the one you download because you don’t just want to delete after a few weeks or months because you didn’t get out of it what you thought... you do what you choose. ✨,I love so many things about this app. First all the meditations, playlists and live feeds are free. It’s really important to me that everyone can have free access. That being said, I upgraded to get the extra perks, but mostly to support IT, so it they can continue to offer all the free stuff. That’s the goal. One can also contribute to individuals teacher, one can support that way which starts at 1.99 (US). Drawbacks: it can be overwhelming when one first encounters it, but the daily suggestions, playlists, and live feeds introduce new teachers & meditation types, mitigating the overwhelming number of meditations. So do the search features. The other drawback, in my opinion, is it’s seems they aren’t vetting their contributors as carefully as they used to, and some teachers don’t have credentials in meditation, mindfulness, yoga...., but they consider everyone an expert. Still I highly recommend it for beginners & novices. It’s changed my life for the better, and I recommend it to my therapy clients, many of whom have started their own practices. I am grateful a friend recommend it to me.,Overall I think Insight Timer is pretty good.  There is a ton of content you can access for free.  It can be a bit to dig through to find what you like, but once you do, it’s a great resource.  However, if you’re listening to a talk and want to skip back a few seconds so you can write something down, tough luck.  There are ‘skip back’ and ‘skip forward’ buttons but if you click them you’re redirected to subscribe so you can access the ‘advanced player.’  The abundance of free content means I’ve never felt a need to shell out $60 for Member Plus status.  I’m certainly not going to for the privilege of rewinding.  Also the rating system is weighted towards good reviews.  I started listening to a 45 minute talk that turned out to be very amateurish and condescending.  I discovered that Insight Timer requires you to listen to at least half a recording before you are allowed to review.  I understand why they do this, but it seriously skews results.  No one is going to sit through 23 minutes of that talk just so they can leave a review.  With this policy in place it’s highly unlikely you’re ever going to see less than a 3.5 star average review.  Just something to be aware of.,I have been on IT for a few years now and I upgraded last year because, well, why shouldn’t I? I’d been using it for free for years and honestly it is a good price for the fact I use it every day. The benefits are wonderful, I really love the features like the playlists and the free courses. My eight year old also uses the kids section and we do meditations together because of this app. I don’t really go for the “online community“ aspect, but that is active if you want it. The range and selection of meditations is phenomenal and IT has expanded amazingly over the years, now with live classes and yoga... everything I try is great. Music is also a feature I use. I recommend IT to a lot of folx with insomnia, you can reach for your phone in the night and turn on a sleep meditation, it works! Not to mention always being free for everyone to bring meditation to the world! What a gift! I am happy to pay and to support something so valuable in my life. Thank you!!!!,I have been using insight timer, on and off, for a couple of years but never without difficulty getting the timer set the way I wanted. I wanted interval bells and got them but never at the intervals I had them set for. Recently I decided to contact insight timer for help with this issue and the only thing that they found appropriate was to send me two notification emails with nothing in them except the automated response that they received my email and someone would contact me, they never did that. I try to meditate, partially because of almost nonexistent self esteem. It took a lot, for me, just to ask for help and then, for all intents and purposes to get completely rejected didn’t help at all. If a company isn’t interested in helping a customer then why bother with having a customer support contact in the first place? A giant let down from another company pretending to have customer support.\\n\\nUpdate: While I did receive two email replies to my request for support it is still disappointing to me to think that it took leaving a negative review to get that support. Nonetheless, thank you for the support you did end up providing.,This app has literally changed my life, I do martial arts but always struggled with the spiritual, meditation part of it; I have a very stressful job in crisis torn countries and was wondering how to bring more calm and mindfulness into my life. I started listening to daily insights, only for 10 minutes a day, and  I discovered fantastic teachers through that daily activity and that led me to taking courses and it has now become a morning ritual for me: instead of reaching for my phone and getting all upset about work stuff first thing in the morning, I now take a class and do 10 min daily insight meditation. This ritual lasts 25 minutes. And I love it. On top of that the yoga classes are also fantastic, there are so many resources on this app that it is worth every single dollar spent on a full membership for the year. I have recommended it to so many people, I hope it will transform their lives and outlook the way it transformed mine. Zahra,I’ve been using this app on-and-off for the past couple years now. So far it is my favorite meditation app because it gives your hundreds of meditations to choose from, a large majority for free! The fact that many meditation apps are paid is what held me back from getting into meditation in the first place. I love that this app is mainly free and that we don’t have to follow a given meditation plan (if we don’t want to) and that has helped me discover what meditations I like and don’t necessarily like. I’m personally very bad at keeping up with a streak and there are times when I don’t meditate for months, but Insight Timer is always the first app I go to when I try to pick up the habit again. I even recommended this app to a few patients (I’m an OTA) who wanted to improve their mindfulness and increase their emotional regulation (and because it’s free so there’s no reason not to download!). Can’t recommend Insight Timer enough!!,As a recovering evangelical, I am extremely allergic to all forms of woo. But I’d had so many friends talk about how great this app is, so I finally decided to give it a try, starting with the sleep meditations. I don’t have a hard time falling asleep, generally, but I do struggle a lot with falling *back* asleep if I wake up in the middle of the night. The sleep meditations saved me. Every time I’ve used it, I go right back to sleep. I’ve started using them at bedtime, and it might be psychosomatic, but I’m definitely waking up far less now than I did before I started making the sleep meditations a regular practice. \\n\\nThe regular guided meditations are really great as well. I have never been good at keeping my mind focused (which was why prayer was always hard for me, lol), and I’ve tried meditation on my own, but never really hooked into it. There are several absolute beginner’s courses which have been a great starting point for me. Looking forward to getting into it a lot more! \\n\\nLiterally the only change I wish they’d make is being able to filter individual artists’ offerings. Like: I can go into the sleep meditations, sort by the longest, most popular, etc. But if I go into a specific artist’s page, there aren’t the same filters available. It’s a minor issue, and doesn’t detract from my love of this app at all. \\n\\nAnyway, great app, highly recommended.,Unfortunately recent updates have made the app more glitchy and less useful. I have used your out for a while.  But it seems that it\\'s become more difficult to use the simple timer.  The need to constantly tinker with things and the inability to leave things as they are seems to be a problem with all technology. It seems that you have missed the point of what you\\'re trying to teach. Less is more.  Just to use the timer now, which I find glitchy and sometimes pauses for no reason, it is necessary to be asked if you want to do a daily check in. Why? I want to start my meditation and first I have to answer a question.  There is something wrong there. Why complicate very simple thing?  I think the assumption is this everybody needs guidance, but please don\\'t interrupt something that is so simple with what you think someone might need.\\n\\nThank you.,Folks, hi. I’m a longtime user of the app, and have seen a lot of nice improvements over the years (I haven’t loved all of them, but that’s beside the point), however, today’s update was a real bummer. I suddenly have a ton of old (deleted long ago) presets showing up, many of which have something in common with current presets, so there was a vet & delete process to go through to be able to do my practice this evening... and that was not easy because the updated user interface is *reeeeeally* jumpy. If my finger didn’t hit the center of the very small ‘delete’ button **dead** on, I’d be taken *out* of edit mode, and the preset would load up as if I’d chosen it for a practice. I had to backtrack from that jumpy accident about a dozen times to be able to fulfill the ‘delete’ mission. Not the end of the world, but also not my favorite moment of usage within this app. I hope it can be calmed down a bit (without reloading any deleted stuff). Thanks!\\n\\nTL;DR: New UI is way too jumpy, and old deleted presets have come back from beyond the grave.,I have always tried to meditate and felt like I could not calm my mind and thoughts to really tune in. I felt I needed to have a spot in my home start first thing in the morning, laying down or sitting, etc.\\nThis app and more importantly Mindful Mornings has been a game changer. Some meditations that I listened to told me if I couldn’t lie down or find a quiet spot to just do it where I was. So I have meditated in my car with this app on my way to work....I have meditated while doing the dishes...I have sometimes meditated in bed before starting my day...and I have meditated a couple times with my 3 year old. Having this leniency with myself has made meditating a habit for me. If I don’t start my day meditating it’s on my mind or I do some breathing and affirmations of gratitude, etc. \\nSo thank you insight timer for your mindful mornings challenge and starting my journey of meditating 🙌🏻🙏🏽,Used to be great. Now great again. This has always been a very versatile timer with an unbelievable selection of bell and timing features. For a brief time someone rewrote the access mode in a really annoying way. I complained and wrote the negative review below. Amazingly they quickly responded and I now again have normal access to their simply wonderful app. To write a useful program is very good, but to stand by it and have the humility to correct mistakes is the mark of actually good human beings. A rare gem. Thank you.  \\n\\nGreat Timer and bell selection ruined by forcing the user to navigate intrusive “check-in” page. Just when you decide it’s time to meditate THEY decide it’s more important to make you do something else, namely answer their survey. And if you don’t you can’t get to the Timer app. For a supposed meditation group it’s beyond stupid.,The first time I tried this app I was completely overwhelmed. I had no idea where to start. I got rid of it because the stress the overload was causing me wasn’t worth it. Years later, I finally found an initial teacher and I’m able to come back to the app with a little more specificity. But unfortunately it falls pray to every other tool that thinks content is king. The paradox of so much content And an app that is not truly free… Constantly pressing you to donate to buy to upgrade… It mirrors the problems with every other social app or Tools. And because it’s a meditation app that is all the more troubling to me. I am learning to take what works and leave the rest but I wouldn’t recommend this to a beginner without giving them some guidance of where to potentially start. Even though I’ve been engaging with meditation now for almost 2 1/2 years I still have to be very careful with this app. Use with caution or better, a mentor’s support.,The Insight Timer is far from just another meditation app... it is a spiritual, mental and emotional college, or “higher education”. They offer a MASSIVE free library, AS WELL AS the FREE live sessions making mindfulness, meditation, NLP, live yoga, and even tarot readings accessible to anyone with internet and a device. BUT that is not even the best part! It is the community of beautiful souls who dwell there. Always supportive, present, you can always find a space held when you need it! I have met dear friends from all over the world AND finally made friends with the one who dwells within ME! I have been introduced to professionals and content that is taking me places in my life I never dreamed possible, AND I AM A BIG DREAMER! CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS APP ENOUGH! Plus it just keeps getting better! The staff are absolutely wonderful as well!! I truly hope you try it.,I have used this app daily for many years.  I use it to meditate.  Over the years it has become filled with hundreds of “teachers, “ many of whom are now live.  There is a constant aspect of selling, either the membership or teachers or something. Over the years I have developed folks who I often meditate with at the same time, not by design, just has happened. They are throughout the world. Since your update, that feature is no longer available, so I can’t see who I meditated with or thank them for meditating with me. I don’t know if removing it was by design since I am not a paying member or because it is an error in the update.  I am really saddened by how far off course the original developer of this incredibly fine app has veered.  Honestly, it is shameful to me that the original intent of this app, to help people meditate has become a glitzy and glitchy undertaking. For someone who has recommended this app to friends and students fir close over eight years, I am hugely disappointed.  Please reflect on your original core values. Please.,So many amazing features are free on Insight Timer—thousands of meditations, talks, and music performances. I love that it features teachers from all walks of life too—all colors, all ages, and both secular teachers and teachers from all faith traditions. \\n\\nA wonderful unique feature with Insight Timer is its live sessions. At almost any time of the day or night, wherever you are in the world, you can drop in to a live meditation, music, or yoga session. For premium subscribers there are also courses of study available. \\n\\nTeachers are supported by free will donations you can make using the app. My one quibble is that I wish they had an option to create a regular recurring donation for favorite teachers, so I don’t have to remember to click donate every time I attend a live session!,I have been an Insight Timer user off and on for several years. The pandemic not only brought me back to it but I also became an IT teacher. The live feature makes it easier to build a community of like minded people with zero trolls like on other platforms. I have contacted customer service at least 5 different times with questions or to resolve an issue. They are very nice, very helpful, and are really good about updating open issues. I also love that I can easily share my meditations on Instagram. Aside from my own meditations, I spend a lot of time listening to other meditations while I work and connecting with a lot of awesome people during the livestreams. I can’t wait to see what new features you add in the future.,Someone to speak to everyone about anything you may be going through. Just keep an open mind. This is the best for an adhd mind so I can get all kinds of help here with whatever I’m going through and time frames. Most important - 1 minute breathing to over an hour. My practice has grown exponentially with this app. \\n\\nMy only disappointment is that I so love this app and would have purchased it as a gift for so many friends (nurses on the front line that would have benefited as it’s really helped with trauma I’ve seen). Sadly a lot of other apps either had free or discounts for other apps that I see other people are using. I really wanted to share the gift of the amazing teachers on here (not just send them a link that won’t/ can’t open).,I downloaded this app on my phone per a counselor’s recommendation for at least a year without touching it before I finally opened myself up to trying it out. What makes it so great is just how diverse the guided meditations that you can choose from are. You never have an “excuse” or can say that nothing will help, because every flavor of spiritual food is within your reach on this app. I think the reason it is so good and helpful is because how genuine the resources are. They come from people who have worked their own journeys and decided to give back to the community. It’s really a beautiful thing to have this open platform available for all to access and connect and heal on it. 10/10 recommend.,Really enjoy this app. That is until I tried listening to some of the music in the background while still using other apps. Went to play a video and muted it only for it to stop the music through this app then crash when I try to resume it. Had to restart the hour track I was listening to since I can’t pick up where I left off without paying a large yearly fee. Then almost at the same point on the second go, I accidentally clicked on a video but clicked out as fast as I could, but still same thing. App crashed an had to close out the whole app, again. Extremely frustrating it’s so sensitive. Like god forbid I try to use anything else on my phone while listening to this app.,I’ve been using this app for a year and a half now and it’s the best one I’ve come across. There was a recent update, though, which I’m not liking at all— it affected the functionality and it’s no longer as user-friendly as it used to be. Additionally, my logs are not automatically updating— I’m having to go in and manually enter my sessions. Editing playlists is more complicated as well. I hope these things are improved on, as they made the app so stress-free. Since I’ve never previously had any issues or complaints about the app until the update, I’m still giving this 5 stars. Highly recommend it and I’ve already gotten several people to join the Insight community.,I was searching the app store and was getting quite annoyed by how many meditation apps are subscription based and limited unless you pay money. This app seems to truly care about people and their ability to meditate and access their app without having to pay. The parts where one can pay money is shown to go to the creators who create the mediations, and makes the money aspect seem more genuine and wholesome like you\\'re supporting actual humans and not a money hungry app. \\nI also love how there\\'s literally thousands of free meditation options, they have calming livestreams, guided meditations, a community aspect, timed sound meditations, and it keeps track of your progress. Truly a perfect app!,I’ve been with Insight Timer for 6 years and I can’t imagine my meditation life without it.  Connecting to other meditators, poets, and Beings having human experiences from around the world.\\n\\nI continue to suggest to family, friends and clients to give this app a whirl if they do not have a meditation practice or if they struggle with the one they have.\\n\\nThank you for being out there and here, every day.  Thanks to all 9,000 - that was a year ago!  Now how many? plus free meditations.  Blessings to all who gather here, wanting a more awake, aware, authentic and connected existence and a more balanced Universe.\\n\\nOf course there are levels now which is understandable but frustrating.  Kind of like boarding a plane and knowing I am not a gold member.  But part  of my practice is not to compare so it offers opportunities to learn. \\n\\nI am finding for  me, I need to find more time for silent meditation as I am wanting the guided more and more with so many choices.  Of course I find those that resonate with me and let go of the rest.\\n\\nI am enjoying the January challenge and it too reminds me to add silent meditation to my day.,I don’t often write reviews but this has to be said; this is a great app. It is intuitive to use and even the free version of the app has several guided meditations, talks, and music tracks to listen to at any point. \\nThe timer itself offers customizable options (start/stop sounds, intervals sounds, etc). Very good timing functionality. \\nMostly what I use are the guided meditations and the addition of sleep mode makes using this app worry free for battery usage and timing. \\nI could go on, but each feature this app has, even the free version, has been well engineered and well thought out. Great user interface and great user experience m,If I could only have one app on my phone, it would be Insight Timer! I have used it for years and it only continues to get better. I’ve healed and awakened more through use of this app and connection to the community than any other single resource. \\n\\nThere is something for everyone - guided meditations, talks, courses, livestreams, yoga, community connection, yoga nidra, music. I’ve discovered things I didn’t even know existed and now can’t live without! Insight Timer has the most supportive and compassionate community that share nothing but love and their unique gifts. There is no toxicity or comparison like other platforms and the best part is, most of it is entirely free!,Insight timer has everything you could ever need. Whether it be sounds to help you sleep, guided meditation, or binaural beats. It is a very positive app whose users are just as positive and as friendly. You can pay for a MemberPlus account but I just use their free sounds. Even without paying there are a ton of free sounds and guided meditations. This app also offers a personal journal where you can make entries and it will record the date and time that you created an entry. It also now features group meditation where you can join friends in a meditation circle which I think is very cool! 10/10 recommend this app for all of your meditation, journaling, or calming needs.,There is something for everyone here. The array of teachers reaching traditional meditation styles, body scan, shamanic journeys, and have found I really enjoy sound baths as wel as a variety of music styles and instruments!\\nThis app is a wonderful tool in so many ways whether you are looking for something to help you wind down for sleep to live music and yoga sessions. \\nI’ve a daily user of Insight Timer now for over a year now and find deal value in paying for the premium. I highly recommend for anyone who is curious in learning more about themselves and humankind with an emphasis on kind. \\nThank You Insight Timer for great work toward making the world a better place! 🙏,The annual premium is beyond worth it. \\n\\nLet your monkey mind chatter all it wants about spending money on an app that creates time to be silent. Yeah, okay.\\n\\nNot so productive it seems? Well, this app has been around for many years. I have had it for many years, and while I didn’t always pay for premium, the free version was always there for me when I needed it too, and it has taken care of me for a long time. I respect their offerings on the free version, and the upgrade encourages me to use it even more like a utility app, a part of my every day.\\n\\nIf you’re a beginner meditator or a long time yogi you’ll ALWAYS find something. Keep searching and the one you need will be there. \\n\\nYou’ll be more in control of your mind and your life. Who would not want that for themselves? What’s not productive about being centered every moment? And having a full and grateful heart?\\n\\nThis is my first review of the app. I didn’t cherish it (out loud, in a written review) for almost a decade but now I look back and wonder where I’d be without it.,Out of all of the meditation apps out there and all of them which I’ve tried. I’m sorry to say but this one of the best out of all of them. I’ve been using Insight Timer for around 5-6 months at least. It massively help me with anxiety, stress, and schoolwork that was too much for me. I felt more connected to myself and more at peace. I feel less energetic and more calm. I love all the new features on this app. I’m really considering getting the premium edition of this app because it’s really great I usually don’t make reviews for apps, but again this one I had to. Thanks Insight Timer for making such a great app that actually work and is great.,I can’t say enough good about insight timer. Unlike other meditation apps, insight timer is free. It’s unbelievable really, because the quality and diversity of meditations and courses are incredible. Have 5 minutes to focus on gratitude? There’s a mediation for that? Like to chant 108 mantras, there are lots of meditations for that. Like yoga nidra? There are so many to choose from. There is a timer for silent meditation, music to accompany meditation, work, sleep. Honestly, I use the app almost every day, and I have never run out of new meditations to explore. It is a constant companion on my journey in life. I’m so grateful for the beautifully curated material. Many thanks to the folks at insight timer.,I love this app! This is a great personal and community tool to access all kinds of mindfulness materials mostly for free! I use it every day or more. You’ll love it! \\n\\nThe mindful mornings challenge they promoted helped me build a good daily habit and they promote black teachers in support of BLM and Black History Month. I love the milestones to track your progress, that there’s now live yoga, that you can donate but you don’t have to, and that there are community circles for discussions (as well as in live sessions). You can tell everyone - literally thousands of people each - “Thanks for meditating with me” individually if you want.\\n\\nThe only things I’d suggest are \\n1) make the meditations count toward your milestones across all devices (my friend lost milestones across devices with the same profile) \\n2) make the live sessions count toward milestones (I lost 50 consecutive days of progress because live didn’t count and I didn’t realize it), \\n3) maybe add an exercise component (cardio), &\\n4) add a mindful dating piece for mindful singles. \\n\\nThanks for your service! #EvolveTogether,I have been using insight timer for year and I won’t use any other app! I have tried a few other meditation apps and nothing compares to this one! Do you live meditation and class offerings are such a beautiful new addition. The offerings on this app are endless. I love the fact that you can make friends and send messages to other people worldwide. I mostly use the meditation timer and make sure to thank a few people for meditating with me each time. I love that I can see how many other members across the world are meditating with me at a given time. I never feel like I’m meditating alone, and that’s a wonderful feeling!,Since the last update I can’t get anything to play in Insight Timer. I am a paid member and want what I paid for to work. Fix it please and I will change my rating. \\n\\nI like Insight Timer, it is one of the better meditation apps. One of the things I do not like is the “non privacy” aspect of the app. Meditation is a sacred private thing, “Mind and body practices focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior.” I do not want a friends list, I do not want to communicate with other meditators or teachers within the app. Communicating with others makes this a social media app not a meditation app. If you must have it then have a one button to disable all aspects of social media communication. I do not want others using this app to communicate with me. If that makes me a bad person, so be it, I want to use the app to meditate not make “social media friends.”,I have been trying and trying to meditate for years and have never been successful. This app has helped me immensely. I find that I am able to meditate when I participate in a guided meditation. This app helps me with that. I have become familiar with different teachers and have my favorites now that I go to.  I also love  that if I am having a problem I really want to focus on, I can search for that particular subject and come up with an appropriate meditation to target my issue. \\n\\nMy only issue with really jumping into this app 100% is the cost of $60 a year. I think that is a bit steep. If the price was les, I would totally join.,I downloaded three meditation applications on my phone and yet this is the only one that I use daily. It is truly free, offering hundreds of meditations for every emotion, for every time of the day or night and every symptom. When I am anxious or happy, stressed or under the weather, recovering from an injury, need a boost of confidence, need to go to sleep or have too much on my mind, there is a tailored meditation ready to support and help ground me. I feel the difference daily! In gratitude to Insight Timer for truly changing my perspective about meditation and mindfulness and connecting me to so many different styles, practice and techniques.,I have been using Insight Timer for a few years now (4 or 5). I used the free version for at least a year, and then I realized how much I love this app and wanted to support the creators and have access to the classes, too.  Win-win. But even if you only ever use the free version, there are *thousands* of meditations available to you.  My all-time favorite is Sarah Blondin, although there are many famous teachers here. And your experience can be customized in so many ways, with many options. I have tried many of the meditation apps out there and this is still my favorite! I recommend it to everyone.,I have used and loved this app since 2012, but for the last few months I have been very frustrated with errors/changes in the My Progress section. \\n\\n1.  I can view my log of sessions, but the Delete buttons do not work. No way to correct an error?\\n\\n2.  In Weekly section, the week no longer starts on a Monday, but is a rolling average. I prefer the old way so I can see my time build up during the week. \\n\\n3.  In Monthly, the current month display in bar chart does not match the time spent in meditation so far for the month. Looks like a flat out bug. \\n\\n4.  In total progress section, and in others, the app no longer calculates and displays the percentage of total days (hours) with meditation during a particular time frame. Please put back the percentages (with tenth of a percent displayed in Total section) or at the very least provide a valid denominator for me to calculate my own. In the Total area, that would be the total number of days since I first used Insight Timer. \\n\\nSeeing my progress over time is the reason I have never considered moving to another meditation app. Please fix soon!!!,I’ve been using this app daily for years, back when there was only a few hundred meditations. Up until this recent update, it has been smooth and flawless. I feel a bit upset, my presets are gone - along with some other settings from bell timer. Meditations aren’t loading. The new interface isn’t as smooth as the previous one- which was fine the way it was IMO. Why improve what’s already been improved? It’s hard to navigate. This is my most used app. It lost a lot of value from this recent update. This app has helped me (and many others). I hope the developers truly reconsider changes and address the recent flaws. The app has changed a lot over the years (sometimes, drastically, sometimes imperfectly, sometimes for the better), but never have I felt the need to speak up about it.,Been using this app for almost 7 years now, the latest update is terrible. Changed all the screens and a bunch of misaligned text and statistical numbers that don’t seem to correspond to anything. A great app that did not change for the better. Might have to try something else now.\\n\\nYou should not have to troubleshoot a meditation timer. Never thought I would complain about the most mundane task to track but, I didn’t design the app. I’m not the one who changed it for the worse a couple months ago. Weeks now of no updates even though the developer says, download the new version, it will be all better….\\n\\nIt’s not, just need a timer that can give me my overall time spent, nothing fancy. It worked for over 7 years, now it looks like a 5 year old designed it, no offense to 5 year olds.,I like and use this app a lot, but some recent updates have introduced a few annoying bugs that haven’t been fixed with subsequent updates. Force touch isn’t working (I used that feature frequently to get right to the part of the app I wanted to use). Also some UI changes make editing a playlist a little weird. Also noticed that a session I manually logged in Insight Timer didn’t sync mindful minutes over to Health. None of those issues is a deal breaker, but each is a distraction in a meditation app. (Additionally, I submitted a support request and haven’t received a reply.) 😕 Please fix soon. Thanks!,My favorite part of insight timer was that when I would get a phone call, the timer wouldn’t pause which happens in a lot of other meditation apps. \\n\\nHowever, today when I meditated, I set a timer for an hour. I had somewhere to be at 10, and I did not open my eyes from the bell. It never went off. I got a call 20 minutes in, which I usually just disregard, but I was in so much pain I thought there was no way that was an hour. I sat for meditation at 8:55, it was 10:36 when I opened my eyes. Any way to fix this back to the old way before the update???? Thanks,I use this application every day. I don’t fully understand some of the improvements for paying members since i’ve always just used the free membership. I have donated to a few of the people who provide guided meditations. One of the meditations I used to frequently use has a chirping glitch in it that makes it useless. The social networking features are pretty rudimentary. For a free application though, I think it still deserves a five out of five rating, even though there is a lot of room for improvement. I\\'m so grateful for the developers. Thank you so much.,I learned about this app through connections with the Mindful Self Compassion group I began to meditate with shortly after Pandemic stay at home orders were in place. Both the group and this app have been silver linings during this challenging time of loss, environmental crises and social political upheaval. This app offers so many types of practice and many diverse teachers. I especially appreciate the attention to current life issues in our common humanity. I recommend this app regularly to my colleagues, clients and friends. I am continually grateful for the creativity and many spiritual informative offerings.,I paid $60 for a year subscription. I’ve not been able to download a single class for offline use. I tried all the suggestions from the help/support section and nothing has worked. I sent an email through the “contact us” link on the app. They want a pic of receipt of payment to assist them and get a response to me quickly. That’s their job to keep track that I’ve paid for their app. Even further, they’ve got some weird set up where the password used for the app is not the password used to access the actual website so that they can be contacted for issues. Whatever. Not renewing and wish I’d followed my policy of only signing up for month to month apps. The pay for the year apps generally have poor customer service - thanks Insight Timer for reinforcing that for me.,I am so thankful that this app was offered as a free option with no strings attached or constant reminders about money.  It allowed me to experiment and find out how much I really enjoyed it.  It’s also helped me meditate more frequently than I have in the past even when going to classes.  I downloaded this app a couple years ago and have used it on and off when I’m stressed. It’s always been here for me and never asked for anything in return.\\n I’ve been needing it more recently with the pandemic, where I found it extremely helpful and calming myself and getting a great meditation experience right here at home.\\nThe teachers are amazing and the amount of content is spectacular. Again Thank you so much for offering this to us for free. \\n I did sign up for member plus today mostly because of my appreciation for this app and it’s generosity and compassion.  I also appreciate that half the donations generated goes towards the teachers.  \\n\\nThank you so much,\\nJosh 🙏,What a wonderful app! Probably the best aspect is the fact that you don’t have to view promotions, you are not pummeled with video ads, there are no banners. You can actually use this app for free and get a lot out of it! And if you want additional features or if you want to purchase some of the courses, you can do so without hassle ... what a breath of fresh air!\\n\\nFor me, this app, and more importantly the community connected through the app, has been a godsend.  I knew little about meditation until I got Insight Timer, now its an important of my daily routine and well-being!,Wow!  I can’t believe this app has so many meditations and practices for free.  Wanting to blend my daily workout with mindfulness, I downloaded this app.  Best decision ever!  I ended up subscribing.  It’s just that good. They have monthly challenges which feeds my “A” type personality.  Lol, I’m working on it!  I have ADHD with underlying depression. This app helps me refocus when I am unfocused and feeling overwhelmed. Amazing what breathing does to calm my mind and my nerves. I even use it right before meetings to help calm me. Can’t say enough good things about this app. I even shared it with my Facebook friends and they love it too!  Thank you’,This app is life changing. This is an incredibly loving and supporting community of Meditators and they have live events of teachers who give talks and teachings, meditation sessions, yoga, live music day and night. These teachers are all extremely well Studied, and experience individuals who love what they do and who truly care about facilitating ones study in meditation and yoga. There are groups to join to feel connected to others in the community and previously recorded teaching, talks and mediations from all the teachers. Best of all you can access it at anytime. This is a truly special app.,I’m about to give up on this app, it was recommended by several friends, but I find it extremely difficult to find anything useful. Today I was looking for a 15-minute brain-entrainment OR guided meditation with binaural beats on pineal activation... impossible. When I choose the time, I can no longer search by keyword. When I search by keyword, then it’s impossible to choose the other features I want. There are 90,000 free meditations but most are for mundane subjects like ‘relaxation’, ‘sleep’, I have difficulty finding any quality meditations on more esoteric subjects, and when I do, they are lame. I’ll give it a few more tries but so far, it always ends in frustration, and an ineffective experience.,I loved this app...so much that I recently decided to become a plus member.  I use it every single morning for my meditation practice. In the past two weeks (since the latest version updated), the app randomly freezes several times during my guided meditations. I contacted support, and they asked me to take a video screen capture the next time it happened. Annoying, but not hard to do, because it happens every day (different tracks from the same course). So I sent it to them. They responded, make sure you have the latest version—it worked for us. I have the latest version of iOS, the latest version of the app, I uninstalled/reinstalled...all of the things. I will reluctantly move on to an app that can make it through my meditations uninterrupted.,I had to remove a star because I miss the older version of this app! Even though, yes, the added content is nice, I’m mainly here for the timer, and it has changed. You used to be able to set the starting and closing bell sounds to ones of your own choosing. Now there is a preset and rather annoying high-pitched pinggggg of a bell rather than one I’ve chosen. I try to work around that by setting my own for a second after and a second before the start and finish times, but the ping interrupts. Also my old presets were wiped when I updated this app. Please restore the ability to set start and finish sounds and I’ll put back a star! Thanks.,I\\'ve been using and benefiting from Insight Timer since it was called Zen Timer. Love it.\\n\\nBut from the beginning and to this date (June 2021) the app has suffered from low-quality programming and poor quality assurance. The number of little behavior glitches, and deviations from basic human-interface best practices, remains frustrating, and is especially surprising for such a venerable app with so many millions of users. \\n\\nI could easily list obvious problems in the current version… or send a list to the developer… but you know what? That\\'s the job of the QA team that Insight Network Inc needs to hire.,I keep getting the same list of friends after each meditation. The app says these friends are currently meditating and they are the same people each time for both daily mediations. As such, I am unable to see at a glance who is actually meditating with me and how I can acknowledge them. It also appears that no one is seeing me either or not like it usually is.\\n\\nI don’t see a proper support feature to directly email you so I have to unfortunately state this issue in the reviews. Overall you don’t deserve this rating but I’m frustrated. \\n\\nI don’t even know if you’ll know who I am and how to respond back to me directly. If I have missed a direct support feature my apologies but I want my app to work as it has for the last six years.,I first found insight timer in 2016. It was simple and gave me all I wanted from a mediation at at the time. It’s evolved over the years and I LOVE how interactive it’s become by helping connect me with other like minded people in my area, and around the world! My new found favorite setting is the automated journal prompt. I’ve always struggled with this step of self reflection and this helps me put my thoughts into words right in my phone after a mindful mediation. This app has become apart of my daily morning ritual and so very grateful for it! Thanks insight team!! 💫,It’s been very helpful. Has so much variety and so many choices. I have been using it for months and still discover new things on the app. Love the live yoga classes, meditation classes, soothing music and bedtime stories. What’s even better, is that some of it is live giving us a more community feel when participating. Other apps I have used I have listened to everything after a few months, don’t think that will be possible with Insight! I am so happy to explore and find new classes and teachers all the time.,I absolutely love this app! I simply used it for the great chime sound for a couple years to time my meditations. More recently in the last year or two I’ve delved into the social aspects the app has to offer and have benefited so much from connecting with others, dabbling in guided meditations, and attending live session. I’m truly grateful for all this app does and how I’ve been able to expand through it. I hope all who are interested/curious give it a try and that it finds those who are seeking/open to what it has to offer.,Truly life changing. I love that Insight Timer offers so much free, high quality content to its users w/o stooping to the predatory business practices so many other “freemium” wellness apps employ. Do yourself a favor and download it.\\n\\nP.S. please improve social and history features! I would love to be able to click through to a teacher’s or other user’s profile when attending an events or course. I would also like to be able to see my history of attended events and profile achievements of some kind. Thank you!,I started my journey alone. But since a dear friend showed me this app I don’t have to do it all alone. I’m so thankful to be able to join people from all around the world that are doing what I’m doing. I also appreciate the fact that I get to not only learn about mindfulness and meditation but I also get to learn about Buddhism. This isn’t to say that’s all there is here. This app is for everyone. Whatever you believe or don’t believe it’s all here. What a joyful thing.\\nThank you to all that teach and participate on this platform. \\nLots of Love and gratitude. 🦋☸️🦋,Insight Timer was recommended to me about a week ago and I’m in love. I’ve deleted the three other meditation apps I’ve been using for the last few years because this one has it all and more! The options are endless, the instructors diverse and I now look forward to my session every day, sometimes even doing multiple sessions in one day now. I also appreciate the donation option which allows me to donate (or not) to instructors who are allowing me to make a difference in my life. Full of gratitude.,Several years ago I bought a subscription from these people. Their service was very good, apparently so good, at least according to them, that it warrants a one-sided, non-negotiated increase in the existing membership fee, to $59 per year. Ok they have good stuff, but it is not worth getting screwed around with by having to repay a contract I had already bought and reasonably assumed would be grandfathered, as such contracts normally are, and should be. What they are trying to do is immoral and unethical. Does anyone think there are similar services out there that are better and, at least, that don’t try to screw their customers out of what they already paid for? Please be aware. You may get screwed on your subscription. Is it worth it?,This app as literally saved my life.  I have been riddled with depression and anxiety for most of my life.  I am in midlife and have recently experienced major trauma.  The live interactions with therapists, classes, music, and others from around the world has brought me hope, stimulation and has provided me with new tools and knowledge for a better day, a better night and a new gratitude for life. It is definitely worth the money to become a premium user!  Please download. Thank you to the developers and the teachers.,I absolutely love this app, but the most recent update has all but ruined my meditative practice. I had about 10 meditations that I rotated between and listened to. After the update, I can’t listen to those anymore- I hit play and they start at the end, with less than 10 seconds left (it varies, sometimes it’s just two seconds). I can only try new meditations, and those seem to work for some reason. I have tried restarting my phone, deleting and redownloading the app, nothing seems to work. I’m really hoping I’m not the only one with this issue and the developers fix it soon.,I used to frequently listen to the guided meditations, but recently, they have not loaded at all. For example, I started a sleep meditation before bed, and when I woke up the next morning it was STILL loading. I’ve tried to start the meditations in different rooms of the house, which is where they used to work. I’m not having any other issues with my data and wifi. The timer still works, but that’s it. \\n\\nI tried presenting this issue on the Insight Timer website, but the Contact Us page doesn’t give reporting a problem as an option, from what I can see. Hopefully the people who run the app see this and help. It used to be a great app.,I absolutely love Insight Timer. It is the best app on my phone and I use it three or four times a day. The interface is easy to use, the tabs are easy to get to, your stats are easy to get to and they\\'re very detailed. The communities are wonderful, and you can join communities of like-minded meditators. This app has really helped improve my meditation practice and in turn made me a much calmer person. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to learn how to meditate. A must have for mindfulness!!! Thank you Insight Timer!!,I’ve enjoyed using this app for years but in the last month insight has stopped working. I used two features 1. Timing and tracking my meditations. 2. Silently seeing a community I practice with and sometimes acknowledging or being acknowledged by others.\\n\\nFor years the app has worked pretty well but recently has stopped. It doesn’t track my sittings accurately making errors everyday and hasn’t shown my friends or others activity.\\n\\nWhen I reported these failures I received an email stating a new update would address these issues. It hasn’t.\\n\\nI don’t know what the problem is but suspect management is more concerned with capitalizing on the apps more complex advanced features than taking care of its basic core features.\\n\\nUnless this app is repaired soon I will abandon it. It doesn’t work as well as a timer. I’ll miss my friends from this app but since this feature has stopped working using the app doesn’t provide any benefit other than practice dealing with frustration.\\n\\nI’ll try to update my review if the application starts working again before I give up.,This app is absolutely amazing and helps me every day and I have recommended it to others and it helps them everyday with challenges. So meditating and keeping consistency with these healthy coping methods has been great. \\n\\nThis app is truly incredible and my favorite. I use to use another meditation app. But left it to use this one. This app offers so much more even live features of meditation not just recorded which is amazing. Especially during times of a pandemic. I won’t be leaving this app anytime soon.,I have been using this app for 3 years! My favorite app and I am an app junkie! LOL They have the most beautiful meditations and talks absolutely free. I have the paid version because I enjoy the amazing classes connecting with community and built in journaling. It is worth every penny for my serenity. There are a multitude of mediations for adults and children for any style any amount of time. I highly recommend this app and have shared it with many family and friends. We can all connect right inside the app if we choose.,I’ve been very happy with the Insight Timer app over the last 18 months. I’ve been using it on a daily basis to keep myself sane. There are so many guided meditations, classes and music pieces for me to turn to depending on whatever I need that day. I’m looking forward to what else I will find. If there was any improvement I could offer, I’d say it would be to include some little feature that helps you to regulate and follow your breath, a cyclical and regular in-hold-out graphic and soundscape, like they have in the Calm app.,It has some good stuff so far (I’ve only tried three at this point) but there is a lot of content that you can not access without paying $60 and that’s just for one year. I long for a return to the days when you purchased the whole thing for a one time payment, that was generally less than what they are charging annually. Sure then they could not offer you an ever expanding library but let’s be honest, most of the new stuff is just more of the same, altered just enough to seem novel to you but that novelty site wears off quickly!,I have been using insight timer for a few years, regularly for several months then sporadically and now am back to regular meditation. I love how many options are available for practicing mindfulness. The guided meditations are nice but I also appreciate the simplicity of the bell timer. The live yoga instruction has been so fun, particularly with limited access to exercise options in the winter during COVID. Start practicing meditation a few minutes a day with insight timer. You won’t regret it!,Love it! I am so glad I happened upon this app. There are many great instructors and musicians leading various kinds of meditation, yoga, and inner work sessions. It’s helped me feel more connected during the pandemic with a spiritual/introspective community. I am using the free/donation-based version and regularly support instructors with a donation if I feel they have helped me (which is quite often). It’s also great to be able to connect with people from all over the world—this opens up many more opportunities for spiritual growth!,I have tried all the major meditation apps on and off in the past 4 or 5 years. This is the best one. I’ve been using it a little over a year now. \\n\\nInsight Timer has all the features of the other apps, but is free. Having access to thousands upon thousands of searchable guided meditations and also customizable bell timers has made it easy for me to build the most consistent meditation habit of my life. \\n\\nWith the help of this app, I have meditated more in the past 12 months than in the previous 3 or 4 years combined, and this is coming from someone who has been consistently trying to build a meditation habit for more than half a decade. \\n\\nI have not yet paid for a premium subscription, but that has never hampered my experience. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor, download this app, and start investing minutes into the improvement of your mind! :),I used the free version of this app for nearly a year which allowed access to bedtime stories, soundscapes, guided meditations, courses, etc. The free was chock full of wonderful, wonderful tools for relaxation, growth, learning, and even connecting with others in a controlled way. I find so much value that I did the “right” thing and actually purchased an annual subscription as I want to support the developers and teachers... what they provide is priceless, and the purchase means the world and my better life!,I’ve had this for a few years now & I love it. The thing I love the most is there are so many great free aspects of it. Most apps only give you so much that’s free before they get you to pay, not these guys. Of course there are some things you can’t do unless you pay but honestly it doesn’t bother me. \\n\\n I have so many wonderful meditations saved & I live that there are so many to choose from! I sometimes get pretty sensitive to certain noises/sounds so I love that there’s a huge variety for those days.,I get so much from this app... my fav app for the past 6 months! Everyday it helps me going and it also helps me get calm for the end of the day with lots of reflection.\\n\\n**Years later...I still LOVE Insight Timer. I am now annual member and I enjoy every component within this app. Not a day goes by that I am not on it. I believe that it’s truly changed my life in so many ways I could go on.  \\n\\nIf you are looking for a good app for meditation, self care courses, yoga, etc this is the app. Try it, you’ll love it.,Of the many mindfulness apps out there, Insight Timer stands out for its gazillion free, quality offerings (and options for donations in thanks) of talks, meditations, courses, yoga, music, and more on pretty much whatever spiritual / mind-body topic you want. No ads or gimmicks for your free account & use but there’s also the option of a premium account with annual fee if you want even more access. The platform feels private and respectful. Worth every penny of any (pressure-free) donation you might choose to make!,I’m changing my original review to 5 stars from 2 stars.\\n\\nThis app has great free resources and is like the Wikipedia of meditation apps. \\n\\nThey recently made some changes which confused me with user interface. I couldn’t find anything and was being automatically thrust into their paid content every time I opened it, they have since fixed this.\\n\\n There’s one more problem I see. They use an icon on the bottom right in the section where a search option would normally be. This leads to their “circles” section which is an application I don’t fully understand. But you have to set it in your mind that you need to click on a different part of the app to find searches.  I would like searches to be on the first page when you open the app because it’s a big function of the app.,I went through a terrible breakup. I couldn’t eat or sleep. The only thing getting me through dark lonely fitful nights and night terrors were meditations. \\nI wasn’t alone as long as I had a familiar voice telling me I am okay and it would be okay.\\n\\nToday I fall asleep in no time and one still healing from that heartbreak, but IT helps me focus on what I want and who I am and where I want to go... it’s the only app I gladly pay for! Worth every penny!!,This is the ultimate in meditation apps. Free free free with the ability to purchase downloading your favorite meditations for when your device is offline, and other minor upgrades that completely DO NOT affect your use of the app under normal circumstances. \\nFREE TO ACCESS EVERY SINGLE MEDITATION, and there are thousands, with new meditations being added every single day. You will not be without a meditation for your specific need at any given moment. \\nDO NOT LOOK FURTHER, this is the best of the best.,I have a very stressful job & life so this is a Godsend ! There are so many options to choose from you never get bored!  Feeling different everyday ( stressed, tired, thankful)  you always have variety to choose from .  Every teacher has different techniques so if you find one that really works for you it’s so easy to find just that !!\\nI recommend this app to everyone that needs to quiet their head & find pure joy in relaxing . Best time ever spent ❤️,So helpful. I feel more peaceful and comfortable with myself. Thank you.\\n\\nMark, you were one of my first teachers when I began to learn about mindfulness and started a practice of meditation. You have so much knowledge and wisdom. That comes through all your immensely helpful books and audio contributions. Listening to you is always such a pleasure and opportunity to grow in my practice. Thank you for bringing more peacefulness, presence and awareness to me and your millions of listeners. Blessings and love.,The most buggy and inconsistent app ever. It worked the first two times I opened the app and now it just says “something went wrong. Please try again. Reload” every.  single. time I try to open anything.  Then it worked on my lunch break today when I went to check it, but I didn’t want to do a sleep meditation during the day, so I waited and now I can’t get any of the guided meditations to open again. Nothing but error messages. I’ve quit and restarted the app numerous times. I’m on the latest version. The link to their “help” is useless, it’s just a bunch of “canned” responses and nothing to actually address the problem. So disappointed as I was excited to try this out.,I have been searching for a way to be accountable in my meditation practice. I have tried other apps but could never stick with them and did t feel represented by them. With Insight Timer I am able to easily navigate a slew of meditation courses, practices, music, etc to help me every day. I recommend it to everyone and I love the option to donate to the instructor because I know they’re giving their time to help others out on a free platform. Great!,Meditation app part of this app is a terrific tool to use in a meditation practice. The timer has graphs to trace your practice along with a library of sounds and who is sitting with you world wide. With use you will recognize folks who sit when you meditate so you know you are not alone. There are guided meditations galore to pick from including yoga . The live part of this app ranges from Buddhism to yoga to shamanism to music to meditate to . This is a great tool to help you build a meditation practice . 🙏,This used to be a simple, useful meditation timer with beautiful gong sounds! \\nNow it\\'s hard to ignore the irony of a meditation timer app that has now become a social media platform and marketing tool for self-styled gurus selling their egos. \\nI actually only use the timer for its functionality, have never been here for the social aspect, and now have to scroll past annoying and distracting prompts and ads. \\nI would be more than happy to pay for a version of this app that has just the timer portion without all the other fancy social options and music.,I’ve been using them from the get go for their wide variety of completely free meditations and have nothing but the best to say about them. They seem incredibly devoted to making meditation accessible to everyone. They recently included a relatively cheap yearly fee to access their new courses, but their yoga/meditations/talks are all still free. I love that there is so much variety and the opportunity to learn from different teachers. It’s wonderful.,This app was recommended to my by my neurologist, who is trying to help me learn preventative things to manage migraines. I am not at all someone who mediates and always say “I don’t do it well”. But, I do find this app easy to use with good selections, short mediations I can do right before I start work in the morning, and am finding it super helpful in relieving some anxiety and easing stressful thoughts. Would definitely recommend to someone who has not been someone to meditate.,I’ve used more than several meditation apps/programs, and Insight Timer is my daily go-to. Whether it’s a mediation to help me settle at night, listening to soundscapes, participating in a Live Event or Course, or just needing a grounding meditation during the day- Insight Timer has you covered for what you need. The app is well organized with its recent update this past year and meditations are easy to find and use. Love, love, love all the teachers I’ve listened to so far.,There are so many light workers here to help you navigate your journey on earth.  These awesome teachers help you open your heart so you can hear your inner being and come to know how loved you truly are.  I have been meditating with the help of this app everyday for 5 years and I always find answers on how to live with peace and understanding through the difficult times in my life.\\nI am grateful. I am blessed. I am loved.\\nBlessings and Light,\\nRita Ann Maloney,I’ve loved insight timer for the last couple of years! It has saved me in some really rough times. This last update I did for May 2021 had made the app run really wonky though. I’m not fond of any of the changes. The mediations start over where I left off. So if I ended it with 3 seconds to go, clicked finished and then then later that day want to go do the meditation again, it just keeps opening it up to me having 3 seconds left. So I play the last 3 seconds and still the same thing. Help.,I have tried several others. But this is the one if you’re looking for a one-stop shop for guided exercise and meditation and journey to sleep, and interested in the peace and enlightenment that a diverse chorus of voices can offer.\\n\\nI LOVE that you can provide direct appreciation via contribution to those who provide content for the app. And I love the simplicity but absolutely thoughtful user-friendliness of the timer.\\n\\nI am truly grateful to have discovered it. Cannot say enough good things.,I have been meditating for more than half my life.  Insight timer is my favorite meditation app.  I have grown in my practice in the past three or four years I have used this app. I started with the free version and last year I switched to the paid. Both the free and paid are wonderful. So glad my mom shared it with me. I have shared Insight Timer with many friends, as well. Get this app, it gets better and better and you will be glad you did.,I love your app so much! I am so stressed about many things and sleeping was something that was getting harder to do. This app has helped me tremendously. I wish that I could set my favorites and delete ones out. Also sometimes the ones showing as favorites have disappeared and show up again later. Not sure why that happens. If I get another job soon I would consider a subscription and I don’t subscribe to many apps.\\nUPDATE: you were a favorite until you just deleted all my favorites and bookmarks! Gone from 5 to 3 stars now.,I’ve been paying for insight timer membership plus for about a year now.\\n\\nI just noticed... that the app never registered that I pay for a membership. \\nI’ve had limited access for this entire year.\\nI can only listen to the free meditations. I cannot join classes or download. I constantly keep receiving ads to buy the membership, when I press it, it tells me that I am already subscribed, then I try to chose a meditation and it goes back to saying I need to buy membership. \\nI literally cannot do anything that they promised I’d be getting when I pay. \\nIt’s been an entire year and I’ve been ripped off. I’m so upset \\nI’ve emailed, called, wrote on Instagram, wrote teachers, I have no idea how to get what I\\'m literally paying for. I loved this app so much it helped me out of a dark time.\\nI’m sad to take my money elsewhere. I hate paying for absolutely nothing. I feel like I just donated to insight timer lol. Tired if these online companies ripping me off and not correcting their mistakes.\\n\\nThis stressed me out more than anything,There is so much free content on this app on a myriad of platforms- music, meditation, from many different disciplines, secular, Buddhist, Christian, etc. There are even things for children. There are lots of courses you can ‘buy’- which look really interesting and informative. You can even filter by how much time you have to ‘practice’. A wonderful tool for people looking to be more mindful and lead a more content and calm life.,So many powerful and enlightened teachers. I use it free and have not even scratched the surface of all that it offers. I found one teacher Andrew Johnson who transformed my life. I now can choose happiness, feel worthy, loved and safe, filled with gratitude and joy when my life had been grey and depressed. And the great thing about that is I can bring that out to share a more LOVELOVELOVE ing attitude with my community. If more people used it we could change the whole world.,I attempted to contact insight timer but there wasn’t an email address or a way to do so without asking I pre-written question.I really love to meditate and to use this app. And it works great...when it works… It is very inconsistent in terms of the different meditations loading. They often say “something went wrong” try again. And I have to sign out of the app multiple times and sign back in and sometimes some meditations still don’t load. And...I have a subscription.,Thank you so much for providing such a high quality product to the world! I love insight timer. It has helped me more than anything else I have found to stay consistent with daily meditation. I look forward to each practice as I know there are so many amazing choices. Thank you for making the practice of meditation more accessible for everyone! Highly recommend!!,I recommend this app in my meditation classes. Great way to begin and to stick with it. Also many guided meditations and opportunity for community connecting. I have written this review twice and I still get a pop up asking me to review and I don\\'t get the choice \"don\\'t ask again\" just \\'review\\', \\'ask me later\\' and \"I don\\'t like insight timer\"   This is annoying.\\nThe app is now dropping my records. I never miss a day. Lol. It’s an ego thing that I’ve got proof I meditate everyday for more than 2000 consecutive days I know.,A dear friend in Indpls, IN recommend this meditation app to me.  I began these guided meditations and it has changed my life.  I did not know how to meditate or be quiet for any length of time, so this has been so wonderful for me.  It is a daily practice now. Thanks so much\\n\\nWe have been using your application for several years and are regular customers.  We love it  it as made a positive dioxin our lives. We have also recommended it to others\\nThank you,This is by far the best of the meditation apps that I have used. And I have used quite a few. \\n\\nThe one thing that is missing and keeping me from giving us a five star review is the calendar function. The calm app has a really wonderful way of tracking the meditation sessions that a user has completed. This app only tracks number of consecutive days but doesn’t show it in a calendar format. The calendar is helpful to see what you’ve accomplished.,I like this because it puts me to sleep and it makes me calm but theirs this bed time story and it’s called the underground train it always puts me asleep I that, I just rated this app a five star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️and another thing what I like about this app like about this app is That don’t have to sign in like all the apps that I try to use always I have to sign in\\n ITS ANNOYING..... but I FREAKING LOVE THIS APP shout out to the person who made it and that’s why you should download this app,I just updated to the latest version of the app and tried to do my morning meditation. Every track I tried to play would cut out around 30s or so and go to silence. the clock for the track keeps going, the audio is just gone. it does it consistently in the same spot for a track, as I tried force quitting the app and retying. I also tried both cellular and wifi networks and the track would still cut out on the same word no matter which network I was connected to. speed tests revealed no issues with my network. seems like a problem on your end! hope you can fix it soon!,I discovered Insight Timer before Covid and the app has absolutely been the cause of my mindfulness and calm throughout the tumultuous past year. When I don’t meditate in the morning, I can feel the difference in how my energy is for the rest of the day. And the fact that there are so many meditations available for free to begin with makes it so accessible to discover it’s gems. Thank you teachers and app makers!,I began to access Insight Timer three years ago and it has been a Go To daily ever since. I have used the chants while walking, sleep meditations at night, meditations for healing life stress, to record my yoga sessions, healing sessions and personal meditation time. I enjoy knowing I am part of a growing movement of consciousness and world community. I even met another member while on a trip to South Africa! All of this and so much more..... Thank You from my heart 💗. Namaste’ M.J. Frost,I’ve used this app for about 4years, when there were only 700 meditations! I’ve grown to love many of the teachers and know which ones will remind me of what I what I’ve forgotten in the moment.  This is a daily practice for me. I committed to 365 days at first, and then just kept going. This group is an important part of my sanity and development. I recommend to everyone I care about and want to care about.,Insight Timer has helped me tremendously with my anxiety issues. I’ve been a Premium Plus member for some time. After purchasing a new phone I’ve had issues not being able to view my past courses, current courses or milestones. I have contacted technical support several times but still no contact back from them. The app is great but technical support is sadly lacking.,Insight Timer has so much to offer! There are many recordings that are perfect to fall asleep to, thought provoking talks, and guided meditations. After using the app for months I decided to purchase the subscription. I like having access to the 10 day courses. Being able to download the sleep inducing recordings means I can disconnect from the internet and still have easy access to my favorites.,Use this everyday. Love this app and yet... Still using this for 2 years and it’s a bit unwieldy. The app has a different design UI on different pages. Groups? Circles? You can’t reply to Circles but you can to Groups? Does have some incredible teachers and talks and guided mediations in many languages - but also lots of so-so ones spread out everywhere. It kind of feels like everyone wants to be a teacher these days. I pay for the subscription.,I love the quality of meditations, functionality and podcasts. However I have encountered some glitches. For example I switched devices bcs of the new phone replacement but settings up a new device seems impossible. Help page with links to specific questions goes to the “page removed” message. So I gave up setting up the account. \\n\\nThe fav can not get unfav... stay in te same section making it impossible to clean up. \\n\\nAside of that, all seems great.,I never struggled with anxiety till Covid. It consumed my life, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, racing thoughts, etc. I turned to anything I could find to help, and this app and meditations helped walk me through my panic attacks. I was able to find great resources to help ease my mind to fall asleep peacefully. I’ve only used the free options available and haven’t even gone further into the premium services and I can’t recommend this enough.,I gave this app three usually I would give it a five I really do like this app but every time you change the format you mess me up I have all my timer set I meditate for an hour every day and now everything is wiped out I can’t even see where to set the timer for 15 minutes I just have a silly little circles and do nothing I need help I want my original format back so I can see my meditations this really is a great app and please help me I don’t know what you’ve done but it isn’t sitting well with my iPad nope nope nope thank you please help help,Can’t really imagining not having this app now that I’ve used it for a while. Nearly every night I have a soundscape playing to help me sleep, I’ve done the trial to do a 10 day meditation challenge, & really love the overall variety this app has. It was recommended to me so in return I recommend it to others since it helps me so significantly. From sleeping to meditation to coaching it’s been great. All in all a great app.,The app has everything I need to meditate. Some bugs I have seen however is when my iPad locks or is purposely locked during a meditation I’ve noticed after the meditation is over the log screen gets pushed to the left a bit. This causes me to have to close the app before I can do anything else on it. I hope this is seen soon so you can fix this. Thank you for the amazing app.,Insight timer is incredibly convenient and user friendly. Having a meditation practice in the morning and night can be easy! I love the encouragement and the mental nutrition that it offers. I recently had a surgery and I’ve been forced into a lot of sitting time. It’s a beautiful thing to feel a sense of community and well being. I’m healing up very quickly and I feel even more resilient than before.,I started using insight timer 8 years ago when maybe it was just a timer. It was the best then. Now it has thousands of guided meditations, teachers, talks, podcasts, and even blog entries on everything from spirituality to types of meditation. This app keeps me motivated, inspired, and educated on meditation. I purchased the year long membership and it is best thing I ever bought for myself. A very powerful tool. Thank you insight.,I’ve been using this for years and the fact that you can use the timer with the bells and sounds (or silence) for our own custom meditation or do guided is amazing. They also have the most in depth and soothing meditations on all sorts of topics so it’s perfect for anything. I love all their teachers and there is just so much to choose from. The bedtime stories are also very comforting. Highly recommend this app for everyone,I love this app and use it every day. I have the paid version and have for years. BUT one big problem is that I can’t edit my profile (the save button does not work and hasn’t for the several months I’ve been trying). There isn’t anyway that I can find to get help with this and I need to put my full name and other details in noe that Iwant to connect with a circle. I’ve been really patient thinking this would be fixed with each update but it hadn’t been. When will this be fixed???,I have suffered from migraines for years. Medications only would mask the pain temporarily. Now if I feel a migraine coming on I immediately use insight timer. With only a 7 minute meditation I find instant relief. Wow. Thank you. I’ve truly enjoyed using your app as it had also helped me get better sleep and overall just feel better about myself. I recommend Insight timer to every now!,I used this app daily for years and loved it. For awhile new updates really improved things. As the app has moved more to monetization and added so many weird features and put courses or whatever ahead of simple meditation it has become increasingly difficult to actually use. I used to be able to solve insomnia issues with a quick couple of clicks. Now I can’t find things even when I’m wide awake, and certainly not in the dark of night when I’m fumbly. I sincerely miss what this app used to provide.,I downloaded this based on a recommendation of a sober account I follow & it has changed my life!! I have always wanted a meditation practice & never felt like I could. I subscribed within 3 sessions. Love how it tracks & I find more useful features all the time! My job gave us a free year to another popular meditation app & I said “hey it’s free it’s the one everyone talks about I’ll try it”…. Doesn’t hold a candle to insight timer!!!,I use insight timer in the morning for guided meditations. As an NYC ER physician involved in Covid pandemic,  meditation and listening to Buddhist talks is not only stress relieving but insightful and mindful to live in the present moment. I strongly encourage everyone to set aside some time everyday to meditate. Meditation and mindful breathing is key to survive and thrive in the middle of chaos. Several beneficial neurotransmitters and immunomodulators come into play in your body and brain when you meditate.,This app is great for meditation. I’m a lawyer and have been practicing Vipassana for 25 or so years (not well). I haven’t done a lot of guided meditation. But this app opened me up to so much more with the offerings. Love it all around. I’ve tried headspace but not calm. I like this one and think I’ll stick with it for now. They could use more established teachers (e.g., more content from Ram Dass, Jack Kornfield, SN Goenka, Pema Chodron, Thich Nhat Hanh and others), but overall the offerings are great.,This divine download came to me in meditation. And I’ve come to profoundly enjoy my moments of connection. Insight Timer makes it so easy with their variety of meditation tools to sustain this daily connection. They have ambient meditation sounds if you are an auditory person, they have self study with a teacher if that’s up your alley. I am always excited to meditate connect and gain a deeper insight to what all of life means.\\n~hugs Jamila🧘🏾\\u200d♀️✨,I just renewed my membership for a second year of this amazing App.  So much to choose from, sound baths, gongs, breathe work, singing bowls, as well as courses and live events. When I do a single mediation it adds the time to the health app; however when I take a course I don’t get any activity credit. My one grip about the app.  Please add option to track course work.  Thanks for an amazing app❣️,I have had this for years alms love it. Many different types of meditations offered. Even though there are options to purchase certain mediations.. I’ve never been forced to, or hit with extreme advertising. The free sessions available have have always fulfilled my needs..  Most of the people that have offer sessions, have a donation button available if you choose to donate..,The live workshops do NOT update. You click on ones saying “Live” only to find they are not, actually. They finished hours ago. There is no way to refresh them. You have to power off and on your phone throughout the day. \\n   B going to is NOT relaxing. The classes also frequently freeze. \\n   It doesn’t have a clean look or interface. More like being at a really busy fair. \\n  There are some amazing teachers. And I like the timer for meditation and the simplicity of that. \\n  Other teachers go overboard in the way they ask for donations, looking almost panicked and some appear passive/aggressive about it. Almost angry. I’m happy to donate to some that seem more professional and sincere. But I’m not going to be guilt tripped into donating. After all we are ALL going through hard times. \\n  The bugs make me question the whole thing though.,I have been using Insight Timer for years and I think it is probably the best available. BUT just when I become accustomed to a really good aspect of this app they change it! So be prepared. My latest example: I had the timer set to go to the aspect of it that I want it  to open to. Suddenly that no longer works! Now I have to go to the homepage, which is of no interest to me, and select the aspect that I want. Come on guys, have a little compassion for those of us who are long time users.,I used Headspace for years and I loved that app and didn’t think there was anything that could match it. I did a big portion of their guided meditations and was looking to cut back on spending so I cancelled a bunch of streaming apps and, after finding Insight Timer, decided to cancel Headspace. Headspace started my meditation journey, which I am very grateful for but I have no regrets switching to Insight. It’s a wonderful app with lots of content.,I really appreciate the features of insight timer. The self timer and its presets are great for self structured meditation. It has enough customization to be useful and not so much to be annoying. The audio meditations are great. I appreciate the variety and all the teachers I have heard are good. I also like the badges and metrics because they help reinforce building a habit of daily reflection/meditation.,I’ve studied yoga for many years, and when I began, there was very little available. There weren’t studios on every corner and there was no such thing as an app. I’m so very impressed and grateful that insight timer has made the decision to make a grand difference in the world. It is such a blessing to be able to study with so many outstanding teachers. From the deepest part of my heart I think you.,Hello, just thought you all should know that while I was listening to a meditation the teacher began a live event and the live event began playing over the meditation. I had not signed up to attend the live event and could only pause the prerecorded event. I finally had to discontinue the meditation because I could not find a way to separate the two. Hopefully this was just a one off. I love the app,Insight timer has truly helped me fall in love with meditating and sitting still. I’ve struggled beforehand to do that, and never liked meditation since I wasn’t great at it. But insight timer has changed that with the wonderful meditations, courses, and live meditations and sessions.\\nThe app was cutting off my meditations in the middle of them, or in the beginning, but that has gotten so much better.,This app is great for those of us who have been searching for simple and accessible ways to meditate, find peace, and accept what we’re all moving through. It is profound moment of change, and it is an unsettling time. This app provides a great way to find those guides to help you on your journey if you’re in search of them.,There is so much packed in this tiny little app. So many different things to investigate so many different types of meditations visualizations classes etc. What a wonderful community! I use the timer to set bells every half an hour and do a tiny little mini meditation just following the sound of the ringing bowl down for just a few seconds. It’s wonderful!,I was extremely happy with using the free app for the first year as my meditation practice was pretty hit or miss. Then I learned about the “courses” available with the premium subscription. In just a couple weeks I have taken 3, and they have been life changing (yeah, that good!). Insight Timer is my go to app for first thing in the morning and last thing before sleep.,I’ve always known that meditation was important, but finding this app and the amazing library of guides available to assist with this process has been powerful. The app is easy to use, easy to navigate and makes it very easy to find suitable people for whatever your needs, such as guided meditation, yoga, etc. I strongly recommend using and sharing this app.,Has become very mercenary, complicated, and “over-technical” over the passed 2 or so years. I don’t like it. It is no longer the simple app, you bring up, and you immediately see the bell screen and start immediately. \\nNope, NOW you are purposely guided through screens with links that “guide” you into more complicated and paid choices with goofy and silly human “programs” with “premium features”. Boy this app sure has revolved. Evolved into a “karma-ugly” greedy, and “just another” subscription hawking train-wreck. So sad. Used to be very nice. It literally has lost its soul.,I had wanted to learn to meditate since I was 12-13 year old. And yet meditating felt like time out every-time I attempted it. It was hard to find a path to calm my mind.  This app is my guide and navigation system to help me along. \\n\\nThis app is packed full of peace, calm and wisdom. I unpack a little of it each morning with my tea and it feels like a gift. \\n\\nThis morning, I shared 10 minutes guided kids meditation session with my 12 year old daughter. At the end of the session, she said “I will wake up earlier tomorrow to do this with you, mom.”\\n\\nSpending 15-30 minutes on this app every morning has become a game changer for me. \\n\\nI am looking forward to this new year and calmer- more focused me.,I’ve used Insight Timer for years, after taking a course online in 2012 and the years after from UCLA MARC center. You came highly recommended and I have done almost 1000 guided meditations according to my log. Although I can’t find my start date and think it is more. But it is so worth it. I feel so much calmer even after 10 minutes!:),This was recommended to me and I decided to try it. I have come back to it over and over again for years now. The paid membership has good perks. With or without paid membership it helps to create a personal and meaningful meditation practice.  I love exploring all the areas and it just keeps getting better.  Thank you!,This has made my life so much better. I found sleep meditations by Kenneth Soares,Christian Thomas & other wonderful meditations and courses that have helped me so much. I recommend it to everyone.\\nPlease try it!!\\nFebruary, 2021– \\nThis app has helped me through  isolation for COVID. I have made many friends on this app, belong to circles and run a   Circle Of my own, and I think it’s great for communication. See you there.,I am a recent college graduate; I\\'ve been struggling spiritually and mentally. This app provides talks/podcast, guided meditations, yoga practices, music, even bell chimes in all different sounds. I have shared it with friends and family who all love it. This is an app that has brought me inspiration and clarity. I 10/10 recommend downloading it and just looking through all the different options!,It’s possible to do so much on Insight Timer without paying, and there are no ads. It functions on a donation basis. It offers a wide range of live and recorded courses, covering a wide range of meditation, yoga, and spiritual topics. Instructors are from all over the world, so there’s a course at almost any time! My one qualm is that I would like push notifications about the teachers I follow.,I have been using this app daily for over nine years and have given it several five star reviews but the iterations since November have failed to live up to expectations. One of the best aspects has been making friends and meditating with them on a daily basis. For months now this function has worked only occasionally and I have been unable to get any support from the development group. It’s sad to see a great app loose track of the little things while focused on adding more and more revenue generating features.,This is by far the greatest mediation app.  It’s effectively a social network and not a cash grab.  I believe InsightTimer with its live meditations and ability to wish others well, personally, actually motivates me to meditate. This app will change the World.  Delete your low vibration apps like the news and social networks, download this and join the most loving community out there.,I have been meditating for the past 20+ years and Insight Timer offers meditations and classes for wherever you are in your mindfulness journey!  I especially like to see how many people around the globe are using the app - it reminds me of our great connection of oneness!  I also appreciate the accountability built in by tracking how many consecutive days I have meditated!,I have been using Insight Timer for a couple of years now. I love that it is so flexible and content rich that you can find whatever you’re looking for in a meditation. From a simple timer with music to bedtime stories it’s all here. I use the sleep meditations every night and have been getting the best sleep I’ve had in years!,Absolutely LOVE the range of offerings in this app. I do morning meditations every day, as well as a sleep meditation, but I have also participated in various challenges throughout the day when i need a pick me up or i need to calm down from a stressful activity. There’s literally something for every person and every situation, and I just love it!,Using this app is terrific. Like having my own personal mentors, gurus, teachers, spiritual advisers, and directors. I look forward to using this app every day. Use it for meditation, courses, yoga, and so many other things that I have yet to try. I highly recommend this app. It won’t do any good to simply download it, you have to use it. And using it is very easy and rewarding.,Now, this app  only shows featured teachers are what about the rest.  I am not really liking it, because it’s not easy to see other teachers Who can share their knowledge and wisdom .  I am not interested in featured.  I want to chose featured for myself and I think it is fair to give all the same attention, I thought the goal of this app is to raise consciousness without putting chosen ones first.  I liked the old version ,  it was NEUTRAL and appropriate for a site that brings mindfulness, yoga, healing to the people of the EARRH. .\\nREMEMBER - we are one !\\n We don’t have to DEVIDE!,Insight Timer it\\'s really quite wonderful. Lots and lots of beautiful guided meditations.. which is what I\\'m mostly interested in.\\nWould love to see some Queer presents here. For me, that is just another level and dimension of connection. Would love to find some Queer Male voices and words to guide some of the meditations here. Having said that, I do enjoy what I\\'ve heard so far. I highly recommend this app and I did pay for a year\\'s subscription!,After many years of straying from mediation and mindfulness, a good friend has guided me here to this app. I’m forever grateful to receive the Wealth of knowledge that is offed here. Many thanks to everyone that participates and is here truly for the benefit of all. I’m remembering how to open my heart again. \\nI humbly Thank each and everyone of you for unknowingly supporting this growth. \\nAs I support yours as well. 🙏 ✌️ 💗,Insight Timer changed my life. Seriously I wouldn’t know what I would have done without it during 2020. Thank you for this beautiful app. The teachers and students on here are beyond amazing and helpful. I was able to work through a panic attack recently with the help of the community which you can speak to live all over the world. Forever grateful. 🖤,This app has been able to get me to sleep on the nights when I can’t sleep. I also have anxiety and anxiety attacks and this has been able to calm me, even on the really bad days. It’s also good when you need to take time for yourself, there are a variety of sounds and lengths of time so if you want 5 mins or 2 hours it’s all there!!,I started out giving this app 4.5 stars. \\n\\nI really like Jennifer Piercy’s meditation. She is really gifted at walking you through the meditations. Every morning I listen to Waking One. I end up feeling so loved after. \\n\\nThe other Jennifer Piercy meditation I listen to at night - Healing Darkness for Sleep. A couple of days ago there were problems. About four minutes in, there was a brief whiny sound. A minute later the there was a longer whine, that kept repeating. It’s unusable. \\n\\nI decided to report it. I couldn’t find any place to report a damaged recording. I checked all over the app and found nothing. I checked the App Store and the website and found nothing. \\n\\nThe customer service is missing in this area. That’s how they lost stars on the rating. \\n\\nI hope they can fix this.,My therapist recommended Insight Timer. I have better days when I use it. I highly recommend it to anyone with intrusive thoughts or anxiety. I love that you can search key words. Whenever I’m going through something I can be very specific and type like “I am enough” or “Metta” and I get so many options. Thank you to all the facilitators!,I’ve been using insight timer now for almost 3 years. It’s a wonderful place to land daily to restore and relax from the buzz.. Many  meditations here. Check out Lisa A Romano.  Great  information dealing with codependency and narcissistic abuse. Thanks to insight timer many are becoming more sufficient and powerful. Taking responsibility and practicing self care and self love.  We humans are evolving to peace and love.,Such a deLIGHTful set of options! So diverse, so useful. Manna from heaven = Insight Timer! I adore the featureS, including the ability to support InsightTimer, the ability to support contributors, the ability to count days, in creating life long meditation habits, the ability to create and nurture a like minded community of collaborators from ALL over the world! In gratitude, B kitten,Never do I review any of my apps but I had to make an exception, insight timer is like no other!! A cliché “life changer”\\nBut it’s true! Where else will you find a community of gurus that are all just wanting to help you meditate and manage stress?? Nowhere. Download this app you will not regret it!! Especially since we’re all going through a pandemic still.,IT is the best of the mindfulness apps. It’s full service selection of meditations, music, and courses provides great comfort in times of stress, while at the same time giving you a sense of yourself.  I highly recommend the teachers that have been afforded a platform to share wisdom on IT, and the meditations, from shortest to more in-depth are quite simply excellent.,I find so many uses for this app. We played some things during yoga, I listen to a meditation every morning, and sometimes during the day, it helps me go to sleep when I have problems with that, and I absolutely love the live events. I have discovered many new meditation teachers all over the world. I am very grateful for this app!,Love the app, it provides a large number of guided meditations and also just timer for people who practice a specific type.\\n\\nLove the network effect, seeing all these wonderful human beings all over the world brings me hope.\\n\\nRecently the app has gotten even better, with live classes and the events from all over the world.,Update again? Seriously AGAIN MILESTONES WENT MISSING! I just don\\'t get why this happens randomly my milestones will be missing. No one contacted me for months too big for the little people? \\nPrevious:You\\'ve updated again and everything has crashed lost 300 plus sessions milestones are not synching at all sessions not being added! Gone from excellent to horribly unpeaceful in one update. \\n I can NOT see the keyboard anymore because it is gray and I am visually challenged who\\'s bright idea was that? Emojis are all messed up change it back please, no one is happy with it.,With all the lovely advances on this app, it is mindblowing that the actual Timer is so glitchy. Bell intervals do not sound as programmed: completely different bell than selected and randomly go off when they want instead of as programmed. I understand that a lot of focus is given on live lessons but please put energy into fixing your timer as it is the app’s namesake. These issues have been present for over a year now!,Hi! I’m Monica! Since starting with Insight timer,2 years ago, I’ve learned how to start my day with meditation 🧘🏼\\u200d♀️.I am learning the importance of connecting with my breathe. I utilize letting go of stress & reconnect with the moments of my day, by breathing. Learning to start my day, with gratitude & clearing away fears & thoughts of worry, that I often wake up with, has revolutionized my life& brought me Peace ☮️,Insight timer is a beautiful service to the human soul. It offers incredible teachers that provide free mediations to help create safety, love and calm wherever you are. I’ve listen on an airplane, in my bed and  camping in a tent. They have met me wherever I was at. They have helped me to fall asleep during a restless night and find my softness after a heart injury. Can’t appreciate this app more.,I use Insight Timer almost every day. The timer options with interval bells, optional ambient sounds, and presets are wonderful. I love the teachers, the variety of meditation styles and lengths, and especially the courses. I recently upgraded to the paid version and it’s worth every penny! Wherever you are in your meditation, this app is an excellent addition to your practice.,This used to be the best Meditation app in my opinion. However after the recent update it is about the worst because it’s not reliable. Frequently the timer stops working in the middle of my meditation so now I can’t rely on it to let me know when the meditation is over. Therefore, if I use this app while meditating, I tend to experience anxiety as opposed to the peace that meditation can bringBecause I have to worry if the meditation timer is working or not. If and when these problems are fixed, then I will update my review. I hope for everybody that they are:-) with metta,This app has a lot of free features but there is a lot more with a paid subscription, that doesn’t really cost that much. There are corses on specific things and you can set parameters on what you’re looking for. It can sync with apple health app that helps me to motivate myself and be accountable for practicing my mindfulness exercises daily.,I’ve been using Insight Timer for about 4 years to ritualize a meditation habit. The habit is formed and I still consider myself a beginner. So much high quality free content from excellent teachers! I finally paid for the premium membership earlier this week to take a course from a fav teacher and am very glad I did.,I love insight timer. I discovered it a few years  ago and have been using it consistently to meditate every morning.\\n\\nThe meditations, practices, teachings, and music are so inspiring and helped me so much to make the most of my mornings and get into a regular meditation practice. \\n\\nI actually feel guilty I’m not paying for this app because it’s got so much to offer 🤍,I used to love this app, but the latest update messed up so many things that I couldn’t keep my previous rating. After years of using it and liking it, I am disappointed. Menu no longer brings me to preset meditation at the start, though it says it should, the text is so big that it doesn’t fit so the screens are messed up... if I want to send messages after meditating. I can’t hit finish or the folks I meditated with are gone... Essentially they tried to make something that worked quite nicely better and made it worse. Bummer...,When I first downloaded this timer, it was just that - a timer. And it was great. \\n\\nAdding guided meditations was a good idea but the sheer volume of content now is both visually distracting and difficult to navigate. \\n\\nThe Circles feature is potentially harmful to users - especially in the case of circles that purport to be for users with mental health issues. Anyone can form or join a circle and use it for predatory purposes. The circles feature is also being exploited for self promotion by individuals offering paid services.\\n\\nThe interface makes it difficult to circumvent the cluttered default home screen and to leave circles.\\n\\nThis app screams “consumption” and “self promotion by ‘gurus’” rather than mindful insight. \\n\\n(Btw - who the heck are most of these people and how were they selected?),(I wish that was still the tagline for the app.) I love this app. I mostly use it for silent meditation with the nice bells and gongs, but I also enjoy the occasional guided meditation. I like being able to track the frequency and length of my sits. The 365-day group helped me to really step up my meditation game a few years ago. Bravo, insight timer! Bravo.,This is an amazing application that I have been using for several years for meditation. I also recommend it to my clients when they are trying to start in mindfulness practice. The app has changed significantly in the last year but I believe it is a incredible tool of transformation for practitioners and the clients.,Ever since reviewing premium subscription I cannot use it.   It reminds me that I must be a premium subscriber.   After clicking the premium subscription it then prompts me that I already am a premium subscriber.  Very frustrating and terribly disappointed.  I essentially pay premium but only have access to basic.,Meditate for 20 minutes, it logs 7 hours, you have to delete and add and should not be necessary. No updates when teachers I follow add new content. Some of the meditations I bookmarked are no longer in my bookmarks but if I go look for it it will show as bookmarked. Difficult to use now and add sessions, am and pm is just silly, it will swap back and forth. I have the latest update and my device has been restarted. A little more testing maybe and keep it simple. More bells and whistles is really not helping.,I got this because I simply wanted an easy  meditation app with a series of lovely bells to begin and end my meditations.  The app updated, with factory resets to the bells, and when I try to restore, my timer settings gives me a blank screen.\\n\\nAlso, frankly, the app is wall to wall attempts to up sell me into buying more features and taking all of these “spiritual” courses. Just another strictly materialistic reality to which I had hoped would be a simple help mate to my simple meditation practice. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the timer has given me “Insight” into the nature of its intent. So there’s that.,Thank you very much for the inspiration.  I’m not much of a morning person, preferring to hit the snooze.  Have never tried journaling in the morning.  Your morning routine sounds absolutely bliss and gives me a new perspective and guidance to try something new in the morning.  💕 ❤️ Loved it.  Thank you. Stay well. 🥰,Before and during the pandemic, Insight Timer has been a constant source of calm. Features that allow me to curate my meditation, listen to calming music while I work, and stay active by attending live yoga and meditation sessions. Very worth the monthly subscription and the ability to tip contributors for their talent since they’ve brought so much calm to my life. Namaste.,I don’t know how I functioned without this app before. I’ve always been a silent meditator but recently started branching out to guided meditations. So many of the teachers on here are brilliant at what they do and I have been able to deepen my practice because of them. I love the timer on the app as well for when I do want a silent meditation.,I’ve used this app for years, and found it vital to staying connected with my inner life. It’s an extremely useful way to enrich your practice or just get started. Habit forming in a good way!\\nI love that there are more options than I’ll ever use, even in the free version. This is the best meditation app I’ve used, and I’ve tried many.,I have been using this app as a timer, and meditating with techniques I have learned from guided sits in my community. As a timer, this app is beautiful. I prefer the sounds available here to the iPhone timer sounds I had been using. As for the guides within the app, I have not used this aspect and cannot speak to it.,I’ve been using Insight Timer for a few years and can honestly say I use it all the time. The variety and quality are high enough that you don’t have to listen to them same meditation more than once (if you prefer). It’s helped to center me in the best way. Great app that’s easy to use!,Insight Timer is quite simply changing the composition of my being. I love having access to thousands of diverse voices, as well as knowing that monetary contributions go straight to the teacher. Of course, shout out Sarah Blondin 🌞 Her poetry pierces my freakin soul!!!!!! Ps. This is the first review of any kind I’ve left in my life so let that speak for itself. This is a pocket companion of peace.,This is not only the most useful meditation app I’ve tried, but also the most accessible. There are thousands of free guided meditations available from the moment you join. Thousands of teachers with beautiful voices publishing their own meditations. There is an entire world of mindfulness in this app and I recommend it to anyone seeking peace.,So much knowledge on here. It can guide you to a healthier life if you allow it to. The live mediations are a game changer. When people come together to heal we create more energy and everyone involved can benefit from the collective energy, and I don’t believe distance matters with energy. Gratitude to all those involved in creating and sustaining this app.,Insight Timer has been life changing for me! It is easy to use and promotes my daily practice of meditation and mindfulness. I love the option to do timed meditation or guided meditation. The courses offered are exceptional! The subscription includes so much content and is hugely valuable. I am so grateful for this app and the creators and contributors that make it happen! Namaste. 🙏🏽,This App has a wide variety of meditations that are educational, relaxing, and easy to use. Whatever you are looking for, you’ll likely find here. You can customize some meditations to be as long as an hour or as short as 5 minutes. Highly recommend purchasing this app.,I was looking for a app to learn to meditate and this app has everything. Music, yoga, podcasts, meditation and so many to choose from. I have recommended this app to coworkers, friends, and relatives. I love how they have so much free content to choose from. This app has helped decrease my anxiety and gave me more mental clarity.,I’ve used pre-recorded guided meditations, some apps (headspace, breathe, etc), and just sitting w/ the iOS timer. this one is pretty great: a huge amount of guided meditations, if that’s your thing, or a simple timer with a ton of features. nice thing the app does: it invites you to thank the people who are meditating at the same time as you.,I quit Facebook and most other social media channels because of the bots, the ads and the horror of seeing friends promoting conspiracy theories. \\n\\nInsight Timer (IT) is the oasis in this storm. Courses, guided meditation, music and discussion boards ranging from the esoteric to the mundane. \\n\\nIf you’re longing for an app for personal development and consciousness building, look no further.  \\n\\nI’m sure it will continue to evolve and develop; hopefully, they can keep the venture capitalists away who, will probably want to turn it into another dysfunctional money grabbing soul sucking platform. \\n\\nRight now, this is an app that provides tools to help light up the way.,I love the app...but it keeps logging me out and when I try to log back in or create a new acount (login won’t work) it says “error.” There are also a lot of toxic people, like someone pretended to die and then I saw them chatting on the circle a day later. They also called me names, and was very rude. Love the app itself, but keep that in mind. Thx.,Truly helpful app and beautifully curated. Not an app with just one approach from one person or team(unlike headspace or calm). It’s a global library from countless teachers, highlighting the unmatched power of a diverse approach. How wonderful to have the uniqueness of many people’s journeys accessible for one’s own path. A true blessing. Thank you.,Insight timer has been growing over the years and it only keeps getting better. Simple to use... useful for all levels and styles of meditation. Incredible built-in community, but gives you the option for privacy. My most used app for years now.,I want to be able to search for playlists. I want ambient music but when it’s just one 3 hour track I get bored then distracted. A playlist from insight timer is a calm playlist to keep you focused instead of a loud heavy metal playlist that is more noise in our noisy world. Thank you :),I love this app it has really helped me and has taught me how to meditate 🧘\\u200d♀️ it’s great to clear your mind and give yourself that space that is needed for your soul and energy. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone and anyone it has something for everyone including kids my kids also love it.,been using this app since 2016 and love the options but they have no problem centering white ppl/ whites supremacists like Giselle budchen and not caring about that’s triggering and NOT relaxing to be forced to see as a Black/ BIPOC meditator so they kinda lost my respect after that. You can’t spiritually bypass addressing institutionalized racism and this app centering her is an example of white supremacy pervading the mindfulness community.,During these stressful times, my yoga instructor invited us to meditate for 66 days with her. How fortunate am I that I found this app? The guided meditations are so helpful. I am beginning to use the timer for my own, unguided, meditations. I am planning on attending some of the live classes soon. Such a wonderful tool to help me through my journey of self awareness,I have been using this app and find it so simple to find a wealth of guided meditations. The model of donations is so appropriate to serve with what your heart tells you. I have other great paid subscription apps as well but this is just a great app i come back to every now and then each week. Love you all,Hi\\nI never gave one star review for any of the apps out there, but insight timer you deserved zero star if there is one. You app is very glitchy and when I contacted them it takes days to response to no clear direction on how to resolve it. I have contacted Insight Timer many times for all sort of issue and if one issue seems to resolve there is another issue comes up again. I am a paid premium and I am going to cancel/ not to extend my membership with you because of poor customer service and glitchy app.,I love insight timer! Use it every single day to meditate! \\n\\nTons of free content and it’s great that it tracks how much time you have spent meditating. I have racked up more than 30 full days (24 hrs a day) of meditation on insight timer! It’s my favorite meditation app and probably my favorite app ever! 😁😁,The lives that used to be stuck are fixed now, and I love the meditation queue feature they added. \\n\\nI still think a lot could be done about fake profiles floating around with very obviously photos being used in fake dating websites. \\n\\nAlso, the circle descriptions do not update for everyone in the circle. You have to leave and rejoin to see updates which is a pain.,The pictures shown in the App Store look really diverse. Download the app and actually open it up and it looks very white. None of the contributors that are currently live are black or POC. I scroll through the rest of the app, not one single minority featured or highlighted. I open the yoga section, not one instructor is a minority. Although there are plenty of people who are very qualified for this work. It’s easy to pull stock photos of: “black woman smiling doing yoga” or “racially ambiguous man meditating” and design a cool piece of marketing. Im deleting this app. Do better.,My pain doctor advised me to get this app years ago and its helped me allot with everything especially my out of control stress and lack of sleep. Also, it helped with my anxiety and all the multitudes of other extremely beneficial choices, all done by unusually talented and highly educated people with the voices of angels.,It has a huge variety of music for relaxing, working, sleeping or waking, and meditating (thousands). Use it for guided meditations (in many languages) or chanting or just as a timer. Connect to social media or not. Connect to others on the app or not. It\\'s a marvel! And with Live Events, there’s lots to learn, music to enjoy, meditations and healing of all types. It’s,I have been using this app daily for over 4 years. I need the developers to know that not only did the last update result in a buggy almost useless app, but their move to collect money for nearly everything is irritating (and now I see things in a Google search such as “can I make money on Insight Timer” like Insight Timer is the new Twitch - shameful). The show of capitalism alone is enough to have me seeking a new favorite app, but couple it with the poor performance and I am looking elsewhere.,I am a very anxious teen and this app was recommended to me by my therapist and it is super helpful. It helps with my anxiety and helps me fall asleep at night. Using the guided sleep meditations, I can fall asleep in 20 minutes or less. Best of all, most of the app is completely free to use. Go download this if you have anxiety!!,I love this app so much! Not only does it have so many different kinds of ways to meditate, but it also has music, podcasts, courses, yoga and so many different teachers you can choose from. Plus live streams. And the best part is, it’s not crazy expensive, it’s beautifully priced for all to enjoy!! 🙏🏼❤️,This app has changed my life. During what should have been the worst year ever, 2020 brought serenity and positivity via Insight Timer. Using this app at least once a day, choosing from its countless teachers and meditations, my energy and spirit has shifted from depression and anxiety to gratitude and peace. It’s an amazing tool... and it’s free!!! Namaste, IT!! 🙏🏻,This is truly a great app. I’m so thankful for hearing about it from a guest on a talk show. This is my most used app. There are many options to choose from such as guided meditation, music, self care courses, live yoga, many meditation teachers, group meditation and etc. Insight timer has been a life changing experience.,I normally would not give this app a one but a five. This app has helped change my life for the better BUT in the past month bugs have risen in the app like locking up, taking forever to load and only being able to use timer for about 30 seconds before it locks up. I contacted tech support to no avail and have not heard back from them. These are serious issues within the app. No other app on my phone does this and it is not on my end. Otherwise get and use the app.,Finding this app is a blessing. I appreciate everyone’s contribution that I heard today. The only reason I didn’t rate with five stars at this time is because of my challenge with finding and understanding all that is available here. I am sure that with a few days of time on the site, I will gain more understanding of what’s available and how it all works. . .,This is the best app for sleep music.I don’t really have any words to describe it because it is so useful 10/10 would recommend if you have to go on a car ride for a long distance and you are in the car with people who are loud you can use this app. Love it,I enjoy the content and find it to be helpful. My “friends “ froze up and I got the same four every time I meditated. When I tried to fix, I turned “friends “ off did a meditation, got nothing (as I expected) then turned back on. Still nothing and that’s where we are.,This app has a wonderful selection of meditations for so many moods, emotions, and situations. Morning, midday and preparation for sleep are all represented. Sitting, lying down and even yoga movements are included. I started using the app almost two months ago and it makes daily practice helpful and enjoyable. Well done!,Everything was going well until I recently had a technical issue that needed correcting. No help in sight! I followed Insight’s protocol for getting help and later learned through email that no assistance would be coming. It’s a little frustrating. Overall it’s a good app. I just wish there was a much easier way to troubleshoot a technical problem.,This app has so much for everyone and it’s offered at no cost. If you are able, donate what you can to keep this app free for those who are unable to make a financial contribution. I would be lost without the meditations in this app to guide me. Try it. It will become an essential part of your health regimen.,I love this app.  I use it everyday.  I listen to meditations, music... it starts my morning and helps me go to sleep at night.  It also has a wonderful community of meditators from all around the world.  It’s great for beginners or people who have been meditating a long time. I highly recommend it.,I signed up for a 7-day free trial on the app, wouldn’t allow me to listen to the course via the app so I went to the web, allowed me to listen the the first chapter but when I went to try to listen to the second chapter it popped up a screen to sign up for a 30-day free trial, when I tried that an error message popped up not allowing me to proceed. I sent this info via the “contact us” link and no response. So disappointed in all the technical issues and lack of response to those.,I love this app- it has changed my life- I never thought I’d be into meditation or be able to start regularly practicing it, but there’s something for everyone here in terms of topics and meditation length. The fact it’s free makes it accessible, approachable and inclusive to anyone. I’d highly recommend.,This is a great app.  There are so many guided meditations included, that there is something for everyone, every style and benefit.  I am starting to notice some favorite guides, but I want to keep trying new ones as well as just using the timer, and trying on my own.,Hey! I love this app and use it daily but could the programmers make one little change for me ? When you promote a live event at some time in the future could you also indicate which time zone it’s in? I’ve missed a few because mine doesn’t match yours.😟,This is without a doubt my favorite app! There are more guided meditations on here than I will ever be able to listen to, there are wonderful bedtime tales that help quiet your mind and whisk you off to sleep or lovely music tracts that do the same thing. If I could only have one app it would be this one.❤️🙏🏻,I own a yoga studio and run teacher training 2x a year and I always use this app. No ads, tons of content and the timer is super friendly. I think I’ve logged over 7k hours on this app at this point and I still can’t recommend it enough,This is by far the best app I ever downloaded. The teachers are absolutely incredible and it has changed my life. If I could only have one app this would be it. An endless variety of daily insites, classes, courses, Live events, yoga, meditation, sound bath and music healing. Just a truly amazing experience. Thank You!,I mostly use the yoga nidra sleep meditations by Jennifer Piercy and in my opinion the price of the membership is worth it for her work alone. I’ve done a few courses on various topics (sleep, loving kindness, gratitude) and have found them helpful. Overall, wonderful teachers with great depth and breadth of content.,I had something really intense happen to me recently and it severely affected my sleep (I was getting 3 hours of sleep maximum, not even a continuous sleep). My therapist recommend this app to help soothe me to sleep, so I tried one of the sleep music tracks and I was out like a light. Can’t wait to explore this app more.,I’ve used many meditation apps, paid and free, and this one is by far the best. No glitches. Huge variety of teachers. Multiple types of recordings (ex: courses, talks, music, and meditations). No hard sell to become paying member either. Makes me love the total membership even more!,Insight Timer is a really great app if you’re looking for different guided meditations or if you just want some music and a timer. There are a TON of different meditations and courses so if you’re looking for something specific, Insight Timer is the way to go. Best meditation app out there in my opinion.,I used to like this app. Unfortunately, the interface has gotten busier and busier.  And now when I was digging through to find my saved timer, I got a POPUP telling me to try some new feature. No thank you. Exactly what mindfulness is not: distracting me with some shiny new thing when I’m trying to calm my mind. Will be using another app for my timers.,I have tried other app that offer meditation recording they are only free trials. This one is still with me. The variety is unmatched. The search is wonderful and I can find records that I need. I can’t thank the people behind this app enough, there kindness is beyond words. Thank you,Since the update (2 days) I cannot play my meditations!  Well, unless you count the last 8 seconds or so of each.  I have used and loved this app for several years, but now it’s unusable.  I have off loaded the app, deleted and reinstalled the app, tried to use it on my phone and iPad to no avail.  It retained all my bookmarks and stats, but no luck listening to my beloved meditations.  I searched and found a customer support email, but no response.  Please do something.,Wow, what a beautiful practice for Reiki practitioners. This is different than the possible every day Reiki you could be doing on yourself and it has allowed me a new way of doing self treatment. Thank you! Appreciated the gaps in the speaking and no background noise to truly connect with Reiki and feel it.,A lot of other meditation apps are very slick and corporate and bland. This one has heart and you can tell that it’s more of a real community and not just someone’s startup to make money. The people who release meditations on it come from all walks of life and it results in a very diverse offering. Love this app!,This is a great tool but it stops short for me because I am not able to search for teachers relevant to my life, who I want to support. It would be great if the developers added tags so I can know, for instance, that the practitioner I’m listening to is LGBT friendly or better yet, part of LGBT community. Maybe make it easier to find local practitioners or groups.,This app provides a very high quality of instruction in Yoga with teachers from all over the world - all available to access for free from your own home.  The meditations are outstanding and familiarize us with a myriad of techniques to meet every occasion or challenge of daily living.,This app has so many features! The free version comes with everything that you need unlocked. It has an incredible variety of talks meditations music and much more! I find myself being able to use it all day long.,The new update had the app frozen and my stats are messed up. They usually fix any bugs pretty quickly so I hope this one will be the same way. I use this app daily and the preset option is great. I love it. Worth the download for sure.,I have been using this app for years and unlike more recent products, this app is FREE and helps connect me not only to my meditation practice, but also to others fo inspiration. It also allows one to give Dana to the teachers (not to some app maker!),This app is brilliant, the concept, offerings, platform, contributors, all wonderful.\\nSadly, I hv to quit and reinstall the app multiple times each day. I don’t regret paying every month for it, however, I’m getting less and less for that money, more important though, I’m losing out on increasingly more of what I joined up for in the first place. Please fix!,I’ve been a fan for a long time and am so impressed at the growth in what the free app provides and the new features keep on coming. \\nLoving the live sessions and ability to create the perfect playlist for the moment. \\nConsistency is a game changer for life and this app makes it fun!,This is by far the best meditation app I’ve come across. You can use it for free as well as paid, and I love the January meditation challenge and the guided picks!! They are amazing and make me so grateful such a great app and community exists. Please continue providing great meditation courses, playlists, and selections!!,As a counselor trainee (CT), this app helps keep me centered and lowers stress levels to protect against burnout and assist inner peace so I can be present with clients and manage documentation more effectively than before. \\n\\nI highly recommend to everyone for self-care and especially to folks who struggle with high levels of stress and/or anxiety.,I’ve used quite a few different meditation apps and this is by far my favorite. The timer capabilities alone sold me upon first use. But the live streams and the courses/guided meditations are all so beautiful and useful when I’m in need of guidance and reminders. Well done, Insight Timer. Thank you! 🙏🏽🙌🏽❤️,I’ve been using this app for years. I love it and will continue to use it! Only, I was a bit disappointed to see my activity history reset itself somehow, starting over with day 1, after the recent update.,There is an unprecedented value of worth in focusing and redirecting your mind to be both mindful and incite fully focused efforts. This app helps with both providing quality exercises for the mind but it does hold back the better meditations for their paid service so be aware of that.,I love how insight timer offers so much for free! The meditations are abundant and the app is organized pretty easily. The one thing I struggle with is finding my actual friends on the app. I’ve tried searching their name, email, etc and nothing works. That would get the fifth star for me.,Have had paid subscription for two years, and find their support service to be slow.  Library has disappeared several times, and questions are not addressed completely.,It sounds dramatic however it’s true. I would not have made it through the pandemic so well mentally if it had not been for the free Live Events on Insight Timer. Any time I was feeling overly anxious or depressed, I’d join in. So many options, live and prerecorded. Thank you IT!,How can you beat that?! Instead of being bombarded with ads and prices, you can do a simple 3 minute meditation for free (the time limit is longer, but 3 minutes can be spared by anyone). I am glad I got this app awhile ago. Wish I knew about it sooner.,3 years later, this app is still the only one I use DAILY. Without exaggeration, it’s been a life changer. I’ve learned so much from the meditations — about life, myself, my turbulent emotions — that directly benefit my day to day life. The key is HABIT. Even a minute every day builds that habit. Thanks Insight Timer!! ❤️🙏,I am so grateful for this app!  I have referred it to many people.  It has hundreds, if not thousands, of free meditation sessions.  As well as talks, music, and now live stream sessions.  For those wanting to go deeper with a practice there is a membership that has countless classes and workshops.  I am so grateful for this app! Thank you!,This is an incredible app - to have access to so many meditations and feel connected to others who are also on their journey of mindfulness.\\nI have been using the app for 5 years and can’t believe what amazing resources are here.,With so, so many choices I can get to sleep in any situation--when I first go to bed, when I wake up in the middle of the night, when I need that last hour of sleep before the alarm goes off.  Thank you for being there!,This is my favorite meditation app. I’ve tried many, including the expensive Calm app - which I’ve deleted because Insight Timer is the best. Love the variety it offers like Yoga Nidra, Energy Healing, Sound Bowls, the list goes on. I’ve managed to keep a consistent meditation habit & credit this app.,I’ve tried so many meditation apps for years but this is the only one that had stuck. The one thing I wish was better was that the bedtime story section has is starting to be filled with things that aren’t really bedtime stories anymore and that could be filtered into different sections.,It’s still under development but the features keep coming. I wish the desktop version had the same functionality as the app. Also, after the most recent update, sending a friend request stalls and doesn’t acknowledge it went most of the time.,I can’t believe this app is free. I’ve used in for 4 or 5 years now, and I still love it. The developers continue to improve it and make it better for the user. I like the guided meditations or just the simple meditations with ambient sounds. Thank you to whoever works on this app.,Many choices available—there’s always something new. I wash there was a way to sort the results of a search by length - that’s my only complaint. I never want something more than 15 minutes and it’s a waste of time to have to wade through all the others,Would like to pay $5.00 to just have timer. When away from wifi or in airplane mode the app interrupts and asks for reconnection. I have my own teachers, thank you. And it uses tons of data and space to bring along purchase offers I don’t want. Lovely timer, though.,Best app I’ve found with so much variety.  If you are just needing to feel calm, trying to sleep, have a middle of the day reset...this app has it all.  I appreciate the diversity and range of teachers as well to be able to choose what fits best for you.,TheWide ranging, diverse abs in terms of live teaching, and range of topics and approaches. Think Etsy for meditation, under one app. Leslie J Cameron, Anxiety management & 10 Principles to guide your day are early favorites. The wide range of music, guided and customizable silent meditation timers are very impressive and easy to find in this one app.,I have felt confused and spent years of my life living by chance.  I needed a mother in my life who was wise and had faith in me.  That wasn’t the case for me growing up.  These are the words I needed to hear then and I have the grace to hear now.  This is the mentorship I craved then and have now.  Thank you Sarah,I’ve been meditating since 2013 and found IT in 2017. I love it! There are so many options and I even use it fir stories for my grandkids when they sleep over. Just a wealth of techniques and inspiration. I recommend it to all my friends and clients.,This was my favorite app. I meditated to it for months then it updated and lost all my saved meditation and people I followed. Now I can not find some of the meditation. \\nThe app still offers a lot of good things that I enjoy. The hertz meditation are good and the courses, well you can’t go wrong.,Absolutely amazing.

I’ve learned so much already and look forward to exploring more.,Really the best meditation app. I’ve taken countless yoga classes and listened to hours of music thru this app. The best part is that it is donations based, pay what you can. \\n\\nIf you’re tired of meditation apps where 99% of content is behind a paywall, give Insight Timer a go.,I couldn\\'t tell you how many hours I\\'ve spent using this app, but this app keeps track of it all, letting you focus on the moment.\\n\\nI’m not a big fan of the social components or recorded sessions but people seem to like then.,Excellent app , i am using it for almost 3 years , good for listening music and learning to meditate, it tracks how many days and hours you were meditating or listening to music , totally recommend for people developing a routine to their lifestyle.,I’ve listened to a few of these and now I can’t control my own body. I’m not writing this. Something has taken over my body. I’m terrified on the inside, but I have a big grin on my face and my eyes are so wide open. I haven’t blinked for hours.,It is a wonderful app which has been helping me in my spiritual journey. Very simple to operate, lots of beautiful sounds and timers for setting up for meditation. Lots of people making more beautiful sounds and meditation techniques for a small price.,I’ve used this app for so many hours, to meditate, to study, or to listen to a talk and learn something new. It is versatile and filled with valuable content. It has grounded me many times over. I highly recommend downloading immediately.,I signed up for the challenge and I have been successful with practicing about 50-75% of the time.

I appreciate it. 🙏❤️🐬,This app is powerful in the free version. I think you will be impressed with the rich experience too.\\n\\nThe paid version has more convenience and functionality, but I upgraded only after months on the free version, and the reason I upgraded might surprise you. It surprised me. \\n\\nThe app shares the majority of the revenue with the teachers, musicians and creators who developed the content. I was using the app daily and it made me feel good to join the paid community. \\n\\nIt’s much more natural, supportive, loving experience than Calm or other meditation apps.,I have used IT for several years and have a committed practice. During COVID19 I gave as many free will offerings to instructors and artists as I could. This last upgrade (1) puts money before content, (2) dropped many of my sessions, (3) makes it harder to thank my contacts for meditating with me, and (5) is pushing complete fluff content. I can’t believe how shallow so many of the teachings are now. IT has become commercialized. I’m so sad!,Some of the courses are good, but the interface does the opposite of ground you. It is so busy and in your face. It is literally a social media platform for meditation, with comments sections and teachers posting live feeds and stories. If I’m your into being plugged in even when trying to ground and meditate, you’d like it. For those trying to disconnect and focus, it’s too wired.,let it be said that i NEVER write reviews for ANYTHING. but this app deserves it. i am constantly blown away by how much (free!) content they have— both for meditation and yoga. i truly believe this app has helped me in so many ways. if you’re looking for a great meditation app THIS IS IT!,The only apps that I used to open daily were social media apps or games. That is until I downloaded insight timer. I cannot recommend it enough. I’m much happier, I sleep better, and I have learned so much. This is a must have!,I tried another meditation app, for a day.  This one I have had for 2 weeks, and after just a few days bought the premium version.  There is something here for everyone.,I just bought the app, and I absolutely love the many many titles. The peace of mind I get and can even talk and ask questions to the teachers. The first night I used a sleep meditation, I was out so quickly and sleep 7hours, my normal was 3. Thank you!,Decent app, but I find it hard to navigate (not intuitive). There’s a ton of content - maybe too much. Would like to see more focus on quality of content vs quantity. Or maybe the content I’m looking for is there, but I’m having a hard time finding what I’m looking for because I find the app difficult to navigate.,Have listened to two of Alex’s meditation and found comfort and wisdom in both.  He has learned from his teachers and found a way to pass on this knowledge with clarity and warmth.  We look forward to meditating with him often.  So grateful that we have been led to him.,I’ve been using this app for years, and I’ve paid money to subscribe to premium. What a disappointment to find that ALL of my saved courses and meditations have all been DELETED. What a waste of money and time I guess I’ll be switching to a different meditation app. I agree that with every update it’s gotten worse, but to require an account an delete all old information is quite upsetting. Spend your time elsewhere so you can save yourself some headAche,Just try this app, you will be so happy you did. This makes it so easy to meditate everyday! Finally, it\\'s easy to make a healthy practice of meditation! Thank you very much insight timer!!! 🙏,Used to be a great app. The original greatness of this app was its library like feel. A treasure trove of soundscapes, sleep mediations, and various instrument sounds for mediators. Now it’s motivational speakers with the same content, all using voice tuners. Too many ppl providing crash courses on life hacks, masquerading as therapists. Insight WAS a great tool. Tried the first premium offer and was not worth the money then, still isn’t. It’s not too late (developers) to revisit your roots.,I absolutely love the amount of creativity that people make in this, there are so many options to choose from not only when in bed, but when trying to relax or just calm down!!,I can’t say it enough! I love this app. It has a meditation for everything! I love the different search options and that even if I just have 5 minutes I can find something to center and bring peace.

Neither my phone nor my iPad operate to set times etc. the font size and spacing make it impossible to see the words or numbers properly.

Now more than ever, this app can and will make a difference in your life, helping you to live with courage and authenticity and peace.,I love this app for how it’s changed my life. With the support of this app and community I have been able to stick to a daily meditation practice.  The negatives are lots of annoying bugs.  Milestones do not update properly, I cannot post to group conversations, my history gets messed up.  Updates mess up what has been working.  😕,This is an excellent app to keep track of your meditation practice. So many guided meditations to choose from and I have to say I\\'m impressed with the ones to help fall asleep! It gives me great hope to see people all over the world practicing!,Dear World , I can not go to sleep without this app.\\nMost of the things I try to do it says this page does not exist.\\nIf people say they pay you that is only when you buy the memberplus, were all the courses are in.

Beautiful ppl, thank you for this wonderful project that is Insight Timer,I first started out just using the timer, which is wonderful.

I like to use it the way I need it.,I love, love this app. There are so many wonderful teachers, healers, beautiful music and chants.

It’s wonderful for variety of meditations, quality of meditations. But these days it’s suuuuper glitchy. Often the only way to load a meditation is to restart my phone, unfortunately.

Fantastic variety of meditations and guides.,Insight Timer is my best friend.,Great meditation, It helps a lot. Thank you for it🙏,Best app that anyone can use!!! I love it ✨,I’ve been using the app for about a year now and the content / instructors and live events are incredible. I really enjoy the circles feature that allows you to connect and meditate with people all over. The tracking option gameifies it which helps me stay motivated.  I love the platform and would have given it 5 stars except that it is so darn buggy! I have opened at least 10 different support tickets by things that should have been caught by their developers or QA team prior to releasing. \\n\\nI will add that I am a QA tester of apps and software for a fortune 100 company so I might be prone to notice (and less accepting of) these things (unable to enter live event, unable to send thanks for meditating with me messages, etc.). The number of development related issues experienced by me, and others I meditate with on the app is wild. Being in the field of technology I take it on myself to open these tickets since I know how to troubleshoot them to make sure it’s not a user error and to help others on the app experiencing the same. Tech support asks a lot of users who open a support ticket - screen shots, then screen recordings, then allow them to log in as you, emails from multiple people asking for the same thing ... they are all incredibly helpful, professional, and polite, and I believe doing what they’ve been instructed to do, but it’s *a lot* to ask for someone who isn’t being paid to QA their work. \\n\\nThe content though, again, is incredible and I find a lot of value in that. Only marking it down because of how I find the user experience when I have to open a ticket to report something g that’s not working as designed.,A must have fir mental clarity and sanity in today’s world,Amazing for beginning meditation and finding deeper self awareness and assurance.,No words.

Write support. This is pathetic.  Next step is credit card support.,An ethical, healthy, non-toxic App run by amazing beautiful people!,They are moving further and further afield from the original point of this app, what was to be a solid and reliable timer for meditation.  They seem to be focused now on adding what to me are pointless social media features like the new mood tracker. It wouldn\\'t be such a big deal except every update also introduces new bugs which make the timer harder to use and less reliable. With this latest update, all the timers I had created were placed in a random order and I had to spend about 20 minutes putting them back in order. Now, when I change a timer and save it, it is saved out of order and I have to go back and put it in the correct order again, which, because the interface is so clunky, takes about 5 extra minutes. Worst of all, now about half of my mediation sessions are logged with the incorrect time and I have to go in and manually edit the logs to record the correct time. This also has such a poor interface that it takes way more time to do this than it should, especially since I now have to do it for about half of my sessions. As an example, one of my 35 minute sessions was logged as 7 and a half hours. Another 20 minute session was logged as an hour and a half. The whole point of this app, and the reason I had been using it for so long, was to accurately keep track of my meditation time so I could look back and see how I\\'m doing over a period of time. If things keep going in this direction, in a couple of updates this app will become useless to me.,It’s a fabulous app, and it’s so easy to use.,I have feedback for Alex L (Alexandra). Stop talking so much! Your beginner guided meditation was not helpful to me, as I couldn’t quiet my mind while you kept talking.

Absolutely love it,So much free content,Unlike a lot of meditation apps, there’s A LOT of quality material on the app that’s free.  No free trial - then pay, there’s no pressure to subscribe to the full site.     There’s so much variety and I can’t imagine how someone wouldn’t be able to find meditations, music, talks or live events to meet their needs on the free side.    The variety and quality of material is phenomenal.    And I’m really starting to enjoy getting more into the circles (Or communities).     \\n\\nI’ve tried quite a few of the other meditation apps out there and this app is just on a different level than the rest of them.   Truly in a class of its own.   \\n\\nI like that we can subscribe to get enhanced features.     I also like that we have the option to donate to individual teachers as well.    I also just love the variety of material that’s available.   If I need a 10 minute meditation, I can sort and find something.    If I wanna listen to something longer, I can find that too.   It’s so easy to navigate!    \\n\\nThis app was a life saver for me last year during the height of the pandemic.   I recommend it to everyone I know w/o prompting.   I am not a paid spokesperson and rarely gush like this about apps I like. \\n\\n I simply love telling people about this app because it helped me change my life for the better - and I didn’t have to spend a lot of money to make these changes and explore my spirituality more deeply.    I’ll always be grateful for the skills I’ve learned because of insight timer!     \\n\\nPeople are wasting their time, effort and money trying to use other meditation apps.   I’m speaking as someone ‘who’s been there and done that.’     Insight timer is truly a game-changer.    Much love and gratitude.  ❤️❤️\\n\\n(I would give it even more stars if the rating system would let me!   😂👍),Great value,the newest update means i can’t play ANY of my bookmarked tracks.,first I love this app, I use meditations almost daily. it’s is my companion in a time when nearly all my other routines and comforts have disappeared! \\n\\nhere are a few ways to improve. \\n\\nthere should be a section of life events that you have selected for yourself, you can see “my courses“ but you can’t see your life events with a schedule \\n\\nfrom the iPhone app you should also be able to add them to your calendar\\n\\nThe sound doesn’t work when I play meditations or yoga live stream sessions on my laptop, only from my phone\\n\\nOnce a session is live, it should say when it started, and what the session is! If you have noted to attend a few live sessions at the same time, the app will only tell you their live, and when you click in the session is going on, but there’s no way to see the description of the app and remind yourself what you thought you might\\n\\nfinally and possibly most important, you should be able to set up a “watch next“ list! Sort of like a playlist, this way I can tag meditations that I come across for a later time, and explore different teachers. This would really help me understand different teachers, instead I spend a lot more time scrolling through trying to find them again \\n\\nplease be encouraged this app has been my friend through Covid, through loss of job, through a second break up in this pandemic, I really appreciate everything you do! I probably will be upgrading as well, I really love how there’s so many events to accommodate yourself before upgrading, all the free events have helped me become a meditator, and feel confident enough to upgrade, which I plan to do in the next few weeks, so I can start taking some courses,This felt more like an aerobics class than a meditation. It’s invigorating but not my preference for waking up.,I love hanging out here. 👍❤️,The technology is unreliable.,I love it !,Amazing journey. Take it.,Stop YouTubing and use this.,I love this guy,I’ve used both the free version and paid version of Insight Timer for 3+ years. In terms of having access to some of the most amazing, well known, and even unknown teachers with lessons to share, I find the app to be great. I’m a casual meditator who tries to log at least 5 sessions per week, so I use the app somewhat regularly. For casual and intermediate meditators, I think this app will serve your needs. I can’t speak to advanced and expert level because, well, I’m not there and not sure what that level requires in terms of support. I have a hunch that an app is probably not part of those needs, but again, that’s not where I’m at.\\n\\nI do think the app and experience could be better in a couple of ways. First, I signed up for a 12 month membership that was recently renewed. I didn’t receive an advanced notice of this renewal which was a bit frustrating, but in the world of subscription services, this seems to be common practice. I wished the team would have provided advanced notice of the renewal because had they done that, I would have chosen the free version over the paid service. Mainly, I use the guided meditations, talks, and timer, all of which are available for free. I thought the courses would be a more regular part of my experience on the app, but they haven’t been, so that’s one area I felt the customer service/marketing teams at Insight could have taken initiative and not fallen into a practice of assuming the user is aware of the renewal date. \\n\\nI’ve enjoyed the playlists that have been created by the team, but they aren’t really discoverable. This could be my lacking of knowledge on how to discover them, but even if I type in “playlist” into the search function, none of them populate in the results. I’ve found some of my favorite guided sessions on playlists, and when trying to rediscover those, have not been able to because 1) I admittedly didn’t save it 2) I remember the playlist but not the meditation name and 3) Playlists are just not visible anywhere in the experience.\\n\\nAll in all, it’s a great app for meditators looking for support in their journey. I would recommend this app, though I would personally say “stick with the free version”. The value of becoming a paying member just didn’t really deliver for me, but now that I’ve been renewed for another year, I’m going to try and take advantage of those “extra features” afforded to paying members while also keeping a close eye on that renewal date so I can respectfully decline and stick to the free option. \\n\\nHappy meditating everyone!,Enjoy,Get it!,I don\\'t like this app. Will look for alternative,The new format is terrible. Very user “unfriendly”. Please go back to the old one!!,How in the world do you navigate this app?,Some great teachers and guided meditations but terrible app and hideous service. No responses.,Horrible voices, not relaxing at all. Not helpful with meditation in the slightest. Calm is better,So lovely,Not the best first impression as it’s unusable,awesome thanks,Loved it !!!,Great, amazing, encouraging guided meditation 🧘\\u200d♀️! I feel renewed. Namaste 🙏🏻,Best of mindfulness apps,Love this App! Best meditation assistant ever.,Beautiful!!!!!!,This is very wonderful to enjoy as ever,good app,I love this app!,lately i’ve notice i cannot connect with others on the app like i use to. kind of a bummer,LOVE this app - the ‘circles’ are great communities,Nice app, but very slow and support is non existent..,Love it!,Love this meditation 🤍🤍🤍,This is a great app  I love it,Thanks,This app is perfect.,Love this application 🙏🏻,That was lovely Sarah,Breath.,I love all the stories their amazing I really love velveteen rabbit,it used to work well. now its glitchy af.,I have been an Insight Timer user for 5 years and a paid customer for a 3-4 years. I use the app everyday and love love love the classes, teachers, and meditation. This is the space I come to for rest everyday and I am very grateful for the app. \\n\\nLast month I was having issues logging in and tried multiple times with password, apple Face ID, Facebook ID, and resetting the password through my email. It then prompted me to contact customer service. This took them a couple weeks to get back to me and i tried multiple mornings to access my account and allowed this to frustrate me when I was trying to meditate and start my morning ritual. Universe testing my patience I guess!\\n\\nWhen Customer service (Vivian) did return my email, they accused me of violating their race and anti-hate speech policy inside the chat rooms and course classrooms and threatened permanent termination and told me to sign this policy (which I’m sure I already signed) and they would allow me to have access to my account again.\\n\\nI replied letting them know that I don’t use the app for messaging people or chatting in rooms, so my account must have been hacked and I don’t appreciate being accused for something I don’t partake in when I’m a paying customer and if they need me to sign something to access my account I can do that but please look into my history and if someone has hacked my account.\\n\\nA week or 2 later Vivian gets back to me apologizing and reinstating my account without me signing anything but still didn’t answer any of my questions as to what happened with my account. She actually implied that there were still complaints about my activity in chat rooms and classrooms.\\n\\nI rewrote her explaining again that I don’t message people or use chat rooms or classrooms to communicate with other members and could she please investigate my account and find out what’s going on or if this is an internal issue.\\n\\nA week later I received an email reply encouraging me to fill out a customer service review and not answering any of my question or looking into the issues with my account. I plan to fill that out shortly after this. At the time I ignored it and they allowed me to use the app for a couple more week.  \\n\\nNow back to real time, yesterday I was trying to set up my mom on insight timers and wasn’t able to access my account. I went through the same process multiple times of password, Apple ID, Facebook ID, email password change with no luck and more frustration. \\n\\nSo I can’t access my account again and they advised me to contact customer service so I did yesterday I’m sure I will hear back from Vivian in 7-10 business days…\\n\\nLove the app when they allow me to use it, super lame customer service on so many different levels. \\n\\nJustin,Awesome app!,Bunch of crooks,The best.,IT SAID MY HOME PAGE WAS GONE AND SO WERE MY FRIENDS I HATE YOU GUYS!,<3,Love this app.,Bliss,Ok,Oooo,:-),🙏,La mejor aplicación de meditación. Tiene todo tipo de meditaciones, siempre que necesito alguna en específico la encuentro aquí. Realmente ha cambiado mi vida y mi manera de llevar momentos difíciles. Me acompaña siempre. Gracias, gracias, gracias!,Gracias gracias gracias esta app ha mejorado mi vida y la de mi hijo son unos genios,Reall Chill.,Excellent app. Great free content.,Agradecida,Great stuff,I honestly don’t know what I would do without insight timer. I use it everyday. I use to scroll endlessly on YouTube to find meditation never fully liking what I found and taking forever. So grateful for Insight Timer,UPDATE late June 2021: Since April, including update 15.14.2, sessions originating on the iPad sync properly to the iPhone Insight app BUT THEN THAT DATA DOES NOT sync into the Health app on the iPhone. Only sessions originating on the IPhone sync into Health. Big problem for iPad/iPhone users.\\n\\nUPDATE TO DEVELOPER\\'S REPLY late June 2021: Yes, both devices are logged into the same Apple ID and Insight Timer account and both Insight Timer apps in the Settings under Account have the word \"Connected\" next to them and the switch turned on next to \"Apple Health Mindful Minutes.\"\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW: This app had been great for years but as of the end of April, new data isn’t syncing into the iOS Health app on iPhone if the data originated on an iPad. Deleted and reinstalled to no avail. Reset all settings to no avail.\\n\\nNOTE: Whenever apps that used to be good suddenly get very buggy, it’s often an indication that developers are working to add or increase in-app advertising. Buyer beware.,I have been using this app for over a year. Free version. I really like it and use it for yoga and meditation and a quick journal entry after meditation. I want to get credit for activities in Apple Health for a wellness benefit for Cigna and it doesn’t work. I have updated the app and reset several times. When I go to Privacy—>Heath—>Insight Timer the screen is blank. Always. There isn’t anything to check. I cannot find anything that says you have to pay for this feature. I might be moving away, but I don’t want to. Developers, do you read this? \\n\\nI have an iPhone 11. iOS 14.6. \\nInsight Timer version 15.14.217632i. \\n\\nI hope this helps others too. Thanks. Great app otherwise.,This is the best app I’ve ever had.Thank you for this wonderful way to help me stay on path and in touch with my practice.😺,Loved this app for over a year—but it now suffers from pointless updates that ruin what once was good. And why release an update which hasn’t been thoroughly tested only to find out customers complain and delete your app. \\n\\nAnother app ruined by bored code writers and producers who think more bells and whistles mean more profit.\\n\\nDisappointed.\\n\\nAnd no, I’m not wasting any more of my time by filling out your form.,Update: 5/17/2021\\n\\nIssues seems to be resolved now. Back to my favorite app once more! \\n\\nTrying to do a meditation and it won’t begin at the beginning. Starts up with 4 minutes remaining. Been using this app for years (2016) with very few bugs and those that did arise were squashed quickly. Help! I don’t want to go else where after using and enjoying for so Long!,I like this app and using it for years. However the last version update 15.13.5 wiped my last 6 months activity log and presets created within that period. I am upset as I have to recreate all preset timers and anyway no idea how I can add my lost activity as well.\\n\\nI contacted via Zendesk support two times so far but didnt receive any reply yet.\\n\\nI could not get you attention so I have to  post this public review. Could you please fix the issue issue as you are doing so good with the app.,They charged my credit card $59.99 renewal fee a month ago and now the app wants to charge me again!!! Can’t access premium content after paying $59.99 just a month ago!!! Tried reloading app as well.,Request- more ambient sounds on the timer? That section has been left behind on all the updates. —————————- \\n This is one of my favorite apps. I only gave 4 instead of 5 stars because i dislike where the timer was placed after the update. I liked it on the main page as I use it the most by far. Otherwise, great app! Update 11/23/20- I just discovered there is no way to delete messages received. As I received a harassing message from a person I don’t know, who somehow thought this was a dating app, I’m reducing the stars given. I blocked them, but I can’t delete the message. I just turned off messages again. How can a company create a messaging platform WITHOUT the ability to delete messages? Once this is fixed, I’ll put back up to 5 stars.,My husband and I have been dealing with has stage four cancer diagnosis sense March 15, 2020. It is been the most challenging year of my life and his.\\nOn February 11, 2021 he had a very intense, 11 hour surgery after being told three times that he was not a surgical candidate. \\nHe had a very advanced signet ring cell carcinoma that had spread throughout his abdomen. \\nI begged him not to do the surgery, his cancer is considered the “mother” and that her job was to spread and make millions of “babies”, those babies are stem cells that are undetectable by science or healthy cells. The job of the “babies” is to attack when mother is threatened. Mother is threatened when she is removed surgically. It is an in curable cancer.\\nMy husband will not listen to me, instead, he listened to his sister and brother. \\nHe has not only still in the hospital, primarily and ICU, he hasn’t eaten since February 22 and I have been living in the hotel six hours away from home. He also had to be taken by helicopter to their big hospital in another state. \\nDuring the surgery they removed half of his large intestine, all but 4 feet of his small intestine and now has a stoma, they removed his gallbladder and spleen, the entire lining of his stomach and it was caked onto his stomach so half of his stomach is gone too.\\nWhen the oncology surgeons from Sloan and MD Anderson told him that if he attempted to do this surgery, his life will never be the same. They were not lying. \\nHe now has so many holes in his small intestine that he couldn’t eat if he wanted to. He has been septic and just got another infection and when this clears up he will be transferred to an ICU type facility aka an LTACH. \\nHis big surgery has now turned into 3 and currently has tubes coming out of his abdomen to drain all the fluids, pus and output from his ostomy. \\nHe finally knows what my name is but the oncologists were right, he’s never been the same. \\nInsight timer has been the one single thing that has kept me spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally able to get up each day and do what I have to do as a wife and sit my husband side 7 hours a day, 7 days a week. \\nSadly, his cancer load was SO high, the stem cells are already coming and it is only a matter of time but this man is a fighter!! He won’t stop moving forward and I think our long haul will continue but at least we’ll be closer to home so friends and family can come visit. \\nThank you Insight Timer, you are the reason I haven’t gone crazy 🙏,As far as the content & functionality of this app, for meditation it is absolutely excellent! I have thoroughly enjoyed my premium membership for the past year. \\n\\nHowever, to the purpose of this review, I am highly disappointed in the auto renew feature. When I paid $59.99 for the premium membership, I don\\'t recall signing up for auto renew. There is no place in the app to turn off the auto renew. A Google search lead me to my Google account & my current subscriptions, but could not find the app there to cancel auto renew. After trying to contact Insight Timer administration three times with no response, I am very frustrated. I am now contacting my credit card company\\'s fraud department.,I think it’s only a short matter of time before insight time reaches an optimal level of user friendliness and overall organization/simplicity. It’s so close to being at its best, and while it can be difficult to traverse at times, I get so much out of it and its VAST library of all kinds of different types of meditation/mindfulness practices that I have to give it a 5, but it’s more like 4.5... When family sharing on the iOS app is possible, along with what I listed above, it will be perfect. This app was recommended to me by my therapist and my nutritionist, both of whom emphasized how much MORE content was available on this app, as well as how much MORE helpful content it has than comparable apps (I switched over from the calm app). There’s no comparison in quality, and the vastness of different levels and types of content available on insight timer, as well as the capabilities to connect with friends or make your own meditation circles, join all kinds of live classes that are available at all different times, the journaling capability is super helpful, and the app keeps your activity logged in a small variety of ways. You can personalize your privacy and just about everything else on the app. Favorites, personalized playlists, and many more options available to make using this app genuinely helpful for anyone who is interested in personal growth and progression. The superiority over other meditation apps like Calm is immediately obvious upon switching, and the cost to get the premium membership ($59.99/year) is close to the same price as Calm but you get SOOOO much more. I view this price as an investment in myself. I definitely think it’s worth it. \\nThis app is appropriate for most people, from beginners who are brand new to mindfulness meditation as well as the more advanced who are looking to expand their skills and capabilities, there are plenty of options for all levels.,I’ve been so out of sync lately ,And listening to your meditation made me realize I need to slow down and look at all the beautiful things I have in my life. Opened my heart and made me cry like a baby.Just what I needed!,Relaxing,I’ve used so many apps and this is the best mediation/zen app I have. I switch between this and YouTube only to find that there’s actually YouTube people on here. I paid the premium mostly to support the app and access their classes. It knocks calm and all other apps off the phone. Thanks y’all!!!!!!!!,I like it because it helps me keep track of my meditations.it offers so much content with well known teachers as well as new ones. I especially love the plus member courses a s the interaction with other members.,I have been using this timer for years and I love it. Lots of choice of gong sounds \\nThe classes are also great and well selected imparted to just going on YouTube \\nRight now I’m not doing the classes but I would strongly recommend trying them.,This app is the most amazing meditation app ever!\\n🎉🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🧘🏻\\u200d♀️🧘🏻\\u200d♀️🧘🏻\\u200d♀️🧘🏻\\u200d♀️🧘🏻\\u200d♀️🧘🏻\\u200d♀️💤💤💤💤💤💤💖💖💖💖💖💖✨✨✨✨✨✨💫💫💫💫💫💫🌙🌙🌙🌙,This app has frustrated me to the point where I am now writing my very first ever review. The only reason I continue to shell out money for this app is because the content is excellent and there are certain providers that I cannot access anywhere else. However, this app is so unnecessarily difficult and non-intuitive that it quite frequently negates any peace that I have managed to cultivate through the content. Even just reaching out for support - imagine you are trying to join a course that starts in a few minutes – is unnecessarily difficult, there’s no on the draw support, you are forced to fill out an email form and then must wait for someone to get back to you. I’m sure a lot of my difficulties are user error, but I’m not an idiot and have used many different apps, so I don’t know why this one has to be so much more difficult than like, Spotify. I’ve referred many friends and family members to insight timer by sharing content, and without fail their feedback is “I hate insight timer”; they give up before they can even get started sampling the content because they’re so frustrated by the app. Keep in mind I am referring to the paid version, which I bought thinking that it would alleviate some of the difficulties I was experiencing. User beware your peace might go straight out the window upon trying to use this app.,I’ve had this app since before they turned into a yoga/mindfulness app. Ok but they belittled what was intentionally a nice meditation timer with all tibetan bells and others. Although i paid for one year subscription. i am not happy that there is no contact information That all the icons for setting a time are so tiny it’s ridiculous. i used like when right when my meditation finished it would straight to journal pad where i would write notes And if you want to just use it for meditation only without the cast of characters and film they offer it’s really hard to at the beginning to find your way to go solo. The being.able to get any support for issues is the worst especially when you’re a paid subscriber.,2021.03.01 review: The app keeps getting better and better, like love meditation and yoga.  So I’ve joined “member plus” and enjoy the extra features and functionality — especially the courses, ability to download and rewind, and the fact that 50% of subscription supports the teachers.  Thank you Insight Timer!\\n\\nNote — a couple of minor glitches to resolve: (1) notifications come in three minutes after the actual start time; (2) sometimes I’m listed as “Anonymous” (instead of my screen name) during a group or live meditation.\\n\\n2017 review:\\nThis is an update of my previous (early 2017) review for this app - still very positive, while adjusting for the features in the new version released in late 2017:\\n\\nThere is such a wonderful variety of meditations that everyone will find something here.   I like the area called \"popular\" for finding new things like guided meditations for morning, yoga, sleep, metta, etc.  There are \"motivational talks\" too, which I don\\'t usually think of as meditation, but certainly could be helpful for many.  \\n\\nI also enjoy the curated series \"365 days playlist\" where there is a theme and intro for each week, and then an individual meditation for each day. It is a nice way to learn about different meditation practices and find new things.  Most are 10-15 minutes but a few run longer.   Varies by the day.  \\n\\nThe \"in app purchases\" of extra timer bells and ambient sounds like birds, and flowing water round out the experience nicely.  I like that I can use those timer bells offline.\\n   \\nFor people with long stretches and/or uneven wifi/data availability you can also pay a small monthly fee that enables you to download the meditations to your device.\\n\\nTo prevent battery drain at night after a sleep meditation, make sure you select sleep mode within that meditation.  (You have to do that on each of your devices because this feature doesn\\'t seem to sync across devices.)  And of course, on Apple devices  you can also turn off location services and background app refresh, and swipe off the timer when not in use to preserve battery life any time.   \\n\\nThe \"social\" features of the app are unobtrusive and adaptable to individual preferences through privacy settings.  At the minimum, seeing the numbers of people around the world meditating at once brings hope and encouragement.  While most of the meditations are in English, many are in other languages (you can filter for this) which makes it very global.\\n\\nOverall the app is very intuitive. The few times I had questions, the support folks were very prompt and helpful.   I reviewed an earlier version of the app and included a wishlist - and I can tell how attentive and dedicated the developers for this app are because every single one of the suggestions was answered in the new version.\\n\\nThank you, Insight timer!,I’ve been way high lately, and no tools out! 175/75 after the hour and some focus. Awesome. Armor relaxation.,This is the original, the genuine and the broadest. This is the only app I can think of that could save or greatly improve your life. 30 years ago I took a course in Transcendental Meditation, it never stuck. I downloaded IT 2 yrs. ago and before long committed daily for life. I don’t commit to much, so that alone was a breakthrough. \\n\\nI know some others apps have attracted big VC money and IPO riches but I have not tried, for researched well and I appreciate this is essentially a non-profit where most proceeds go to contributors. \\n\\nIt’s had some nice improvements and format changes recently such as to its SLEEP section. It has not made some obvious improvements I sent them. Such as they misuse the word FINNISH at least as American English speakers use it. Bless their hearts but they are either trying to avoid the word END and any perceived negativity or the cynic might guess they mislead to increase their metrics? I continue to mistakenly read it as RESUME. \\n\\nIn the end I have trust for IT and everyone in the community. There are only beautiful people here seeking better lives and relationships. Give yourself the gift of this app, give it some time and you will come to realize why you are so deserving of this gift and so much more. 🙏🏻\\n\\n2/2021 Update\\nIT recently came out with ‘Live’, this is teachers giving their wisdom, running yoga classes, making music, answering questions and leading meditations. The users have an opportunity to say “Hello” and comment which gives a lovely sense of community. This is a tremendously powerful update which has transformed my already favorite app. New classes every day. There is plenty of room for improvement but it’s new and I trust they are working on it. I am extremely grateful🙏🏻🌊,Today I listened to Gregg McBride and his meditation on “life is a parade”. I am so grateful for his words of wisdom and calming voice.This meditation makes so much sense! Thank you, Gregg McBride.,...all the time! It’s great when it works, but that is less than half the time. Renders it useless, especially after I’ve spent $20.00 on a course.,This app is absolutely amazing and life changing.So thankful and grateful it was created .,I can’t begin to thank Insight Timer for the variety and quality of their meditations.  It has allowed me to begin and sustain a meditation practice. I adore the categories including:anxiety,stress,sleep,relationships etc.  I use this APP. daily and my life has benefited from this gem.I even use this APP with my therapy clients. I highly recommend and would give more than 5 stars if I could!\\nI don’t know what I’ddo without it. It has helped me through the distress of having my mom put in a nursing home and stepped who just died and my mother in law death this past Sunday along with several clients have worked with.You are all a fortress in a storm and full of healing  bliss. Bless you all!\\nThank you thank you Insight Timer!!!!💕💕💕💕,I had raved to others about this app since I first started using it 6 years ago. I loved how you could search guided meditations and get specific topics—but recently the search feature was removed. Now you have to toggle filters and cross your fingers and hope you can find what you’re looking for amongst 70k meditations. Incredibly disappointing. It was much easier to find what I wanted before. Now I’ll just use YouTube to search for specific meditations or switch to another meditation app all together. They need to bring back the search feature and then allow the filters for those results. Until then, I’ll be getting my guided meditations elsewhere.,I love to meditate & always found myself on YouTube looking for meditations I liked. With this app I have so many options at my fingertips, I find myself meditating for longer because there are so many different types of meditations I can incorporate into my routine.    Right now I am doing the 31 day mindfulness challenge and am loving all those guided meditations where each instructor describes their morning routine. Then I create my own meditation on the timer section for about 15-20min to do some transcendental meditation.  I love my mantra and this app makes meditating so easy I just wanna do it all the time. The guided meditations are amazing too, yet to be disappointed! If I’m ever in need or something to do I just explore the app and never come up short. Thanks Insight Timer!,To the programmers: I would love more ambient sound options in the meditation timer feature, please!!!!\\n\\nI have tried numerous meditation apps and none compares to this one! I have recommended it to so many people. I love that there are tons of meditation options and they’re all free! I am also motivated by the star-reward system, my latest streak was 139 days of consecutive meditation, which is fantastic for someone who just started a regular meditation practice. I cannot recommend this app enough!\\n\\nUpdate: It is 1/1/2021 and I have been using this app since it first launched. I still love it and have the paid version to access the courses and teachers. It’s worth every penny!,This app has been a pinnacle part of my work to be a more balanced and grounded human.  Great teachers, music and timer options.  Highly recommend,At no cost: *I\\'ve used this app almost daily, on average 20 days a month. *Quality guided meditations, authentic user reviews of the meditations *networks, almost blog-like and user-engaged message boards with planned group meditations across continents set for date/time/zone *timer with many options about bell/sound at intervals during the silent (or with provided background sounds) *truly 5 star,A free application with no ads! Yay for that! On a basic level it’s a really great application, providing opportunities to look at sleep and factors surrounding sleep differently. With a new view comes the chance to make changes to improve sleep and sleep satisfaction. I use this in conjunction with another app that helps track my sleep, which helps give me some of the info needed for my sleep diary. I have not started using several of the tools offered, but enjoy the sleep diary and graphs. I recommend this application to others. Thank you to the VA for making this widely available.\\n\\n* Note to developer: Bug fix needed on the graphs. The numbers along the graph axis are not match up with the information put in the sleep diary. Ex. Went to bed at 0200h, but matching the data point to the left axis looks like I actually went to bed at 0300h. Otherwise graph points seem accurate relative to one another.,All that entering in the sleep diary caused me to fret more about my insomnia. Nighttime awakenings increased in length as anxiety increased. The app is also like a scolding school teacher e.g. “warning!” “looks like you have insomnia (duh) talk to your provider”. Tells you NOT to look at the time but how are you supposed to know how long you were awake in the night (worrying about not sleeping)? If you have anxiety and some OCD tendencies, I cannot recommend this app. At all.,When I try to export my sleep data I get an \"email not set up\" error, but see no way to set up my email,Good app with all the data collected but the lack of integration with apps that actually track your sleep makes it tedious to have to fill in data points from one app to another. Publish an api to the app and let the sleep tracker apps integrate to it. Then it would be 5 star.,This app is great when used along with Gregg Jacobs cbtforinsomnia.com program or his book “Say Good Night to Insomnia.” Same diary, calculators, content as the program.,I am a huge fan of the different categories that are available. My favorite part about the app is how each session is about 7-15 minutes long. Although short, it puts you in an amazing state.,It’s really a problem that he doesn’t have a dark screen mode it’s annoying to have a bright white screen at night they should Add it,Would definitely recommend I smoke and meditate and I immediately feel better they have a lot of good options to choose from,I was agitated and felt frustration creeping up. I did a breathing exercise that took less then 20 seconds tans now I feel less agitation and frustration.,My sleeping problem have been solved with this application, this is very useful and great meditation app, I wish there was more free options 😁,This is amazing I was feeling horrible. Feeling like I had to throw up but I but this on and I went right to bed. Thank you for this amazing app,This is so comfortable it helps you to relax and it also helps with anxiety like me I definitely recommend this app,I like Meditopia because it helps you get to sleep better and it’s got a ton of fun good story’s and has kid story’s too.,It helps me a lot when I feel down.,Really loved this app, beforeI tried purchase premium.\\n\\nThey charged my card 12 times, then it was blocked, looks like fraud with card. Those week I didn’t bought any other apps. That’s why only Meditopia reason of its inconvenient.,I love it cause it makes me feel more loved and helps with my depression and anxiety,This is a great app with a variety of meditations. I enjoy using this app. It helps me to get centered,My friend sent me a link that promised a month of premium access if I install the app. No promised premium whatsoever! Scammers! Should be deleted from the apple store! Will delete it immediately and do not recommend this to anyone!,It’s great but not enough. Unfortunately one has to “sign up and pay” to get the stuff that MAY be of help.,Excelente guia para meditar,Me está enseñando tremendamente inténtalo,Adorei ajudou muito com meu alto conhecimento e me ajudou a ser mas feliz e uma pessoas mas leve .,La mejor app para meditar! Wow 🤩,Meditopia me da el momento diario de suavidad y contención que necesito. Las reflexiones son muy acertadas y necesarias.,Buena voz q duerme,Me relaja mucho y es buena,Lo seguiré haciendo,Me ayuda aliviar el estrés, la ansiedad y he logrado controlar la respiración de forma que ya no me tenso como antes.,Lo más genial de esta app es que esta disponible para teléfono como para iPad o iPod esta genial. Descárguenla enserio es genial.,This app has some helpful tools, but the way the AI works can be frustrating. For example, you can be in the middle of making a safety plan, but if you say the words, ‘panic attack’ when it asks about your triggers the AI switches to the script for dealing with panic attacks and you can’t go back to finishing the safety plan as far as I can tell. The app is a good idea that needs some finesse.,Helps me a lot,This app is advertised as an app containing CBT exercises. It’s actually a series of quizzes that prompt you to do activities like “do butt kickers for anxiety” or “say I’m strong and I can deal with this.” Very disappointing,Edit: After deleting and reinstalling the app, Noisli regained its functionality. I’ve also changed my rating from one to five stars. \\n\\nSince updating my iOS, the app no longer functions as others have said. I enjoyed  the app on an almost nightly basis, in order to help me fall asleep, for 5 years. I hope there’s an update soon. If there’s an update, I’ll change my rating to reflect the app’s current functionality.,It sure does a good job of mixing rain and thunder and has nice lights but the whole reason i got the app was so i could relax, and calm my mind, read a book, listen to a podcast etc.\\n\\nBut i cannot find where it allows you to DO anything…  i feel like a bait and switch victim.\\n\\nEven if there is a way the rating stays at 2 stars because it’s impossible to find, but more likely doesn’t exist?\\n\\nI can surf the web… while listening.. amazing… i dont need help focusing on the Internet, its the Internet-  its literally the most focused on “thing” of all time.  \\n\\nSo now im the opposite of relaxed.\\n\\nEven my Task Manager allows background sound mixing and its a free task manager (and better than things 3 and Noisli.\\n\\nThe app of the day is like Noisli but with better sounds and … it allows you to play it while listening to an audiobook or podcast.\\n\\nBait and Switch.,The app does what it says, but the user interface is not adjusted for the big screen of my iPhone 12 Pro Max and it looks like if it’s running on a smaller screen.,App is no longer functional, will not open at all.,What a bummer. This app just crashes on launch every time.,As a young adult I’ve always had some small level of anxiety that I’ve dealt with. The pandemic and job stress has just amplified all of that. I don’t think my anxiety is so severe that I need to get a therapist (mostly because of the cost) so I wanted to find ways to manage my anxiety. This app is exactly that! It’s extremely educational and user friendly to the point where I can feel my anxiety diminish as I’m using it. Just reading through the descriptions of “perfectionism” made me feel so much better because I’ve always been a perfectionist and I had never realized how that affected so many aspects of my life. I’m not free from anxiety, but I’m slowly learning how to manage it thanks to the great info and tools provided by this app.,I don’t want to see you but I don’t want to see you again I don’t want to see you again I don’t want to see you again I don’t want to lose it all you again I don’t want to see you again I don’t know what I want you to say that you don’t have anything to say bye to you bye y’all don’t have a lot to say I don’t know what you want me I want you don’t know I love that you’re not gonna like me anymore I’m sorry I just want you to know I don’t want to see you again I don’t want to lose you but you don’t have anything to or do you or me I know you have no idea how about that I love that I can help me with this and you don’t want me bye,This app is really well thought out. It is a great avenue for people that struggle with anxiety or worry a lot. My issue is with the recommended age range for this app. To get the most out of this app you need to be able to give pretty well though out out answers as well as have a good reading ability. I think it’s is best for adolescents or working adults. Tracking your progress is a large part of this app and at four years old it’s not going to happen. A lot of people who struggle with anxiety etc are too afraid to get help from a person, so this app is perfect for them.,I just got this app and I can already tell how much this app can do for me! I have to daily report which I love because it allows me to review how I FEEL. The breathing techniques are so good and helped me fall asleep. My social anxiety has not helped me make many friends this year, and because of that I dread going to school, being the “quiet kid” I’m not usually quiet, I’m just not with my friends. I’m going to follow the apps tips to help conquer my social anxiety and make some friends!,The MindShift app has been phenomenal for me. This past year has been incredibly stressful, and it’s easy to get caught in a loop of anxious thinking and avoidance actions when you’re alone 24/7. This app has cleverly directed my thoughts in the right direction.  I’d say the secret is the CBT basis, which changes your thinking over time.  The most helpful thing is the belief experiments.  Seriously.  This app is the best.,I really like what this app has to offer, especially the cue cards, but the limit to 3 check-ins a day is going to ruin it for me. I definitely feel anxious way more than 3 times a day, not being able to document that and see changes over time is really disappointing. I will try to use it more but I really need more than 3 entries,As a therapist I have referred many of my clients to this app. It really is very helpful. I love how there are a MALE AND FEMALE voices for each audio clip. I work with a lot of trauma survivors and they are often triggered by most frequently a Male voice since their abusers were male.\\n\\nBut I go today to find the labels MALE AND FEMALE have been replaced by AUDIO 1 and AUDIO 2. My only guess is for political correctness and how dare someone actually call a Male voice male and a female voice female. But instead you risk triggering the truly traumatized.,This is probably one of the best health apps I have ever seen for anxiety. I have been looking for an app like this as I have really bad anxiety and am not able to get help from a therapist. This helps me tremendously. I recommend this app to anyone who needs help but can’t afford it,This app is amazing, it has many great features. It has different things for you to read so you can learn about stress, anxiety, panic, etc. There are also different resources in case you have anxiety, stress, panic, etc. I HIGHLY suggest this app to anybody who has stress, panic, anxiety, etc.,I don’t really have much to say on this because I just have no words. This has done wonders for my anxiety and is better than any other app I have used before. 5 star recommend very very highly!,I would rate this app before four of five although it has appropriate emotional language that younger youth may understand I think older adolescents may not identified with those presented and may want to elaborate their feelings. It provides themes that are age-appropriate to adolescence, however they lack visuals that would help and benefit younger children in keeping them more engaged.,This is the best app ever. 1. It’s COMPLETELY FREE 2. It has different ways to cope with anxiety 3. U can add goals, write a check in, and set up ways to look at anxiety differently 4. Explains that anxiety is normal and explains where it comes from etc. overall u def need to get this app. I LOVE IT,I am young and experiencing extreme social anxiety and anxiety and depression this app has been a blessing my family and friends tell me to use my app in dire days you are all mircals and I can’t say thank you enough and all of it being free is a blessing,This thing has crashed every time I have hit “submit” of any type. When I registered. When i tried to “check in.” It did not record anything that I had entered when it crashed for the check in. I suppose that it is a good flooding experience for people trying to reduce anxiety due to being frustrated with too much and too many things going wrong. I’m just glad I didn’t have to pay for anything.,I just wanted to say that this app is amazing! It’s really makes you super relaxed and gets rid of much tension it’s feels like your just sinking into a world of relaxation and where everything is perfect! I recommend this app %100,Great app!!! Just started using it, put it helped calm my anxiety that I have been feeling all day. Definitely recommended, although I wish it had a journal where I could just right down my thoughts.,There is so many things in this app not just for you anxiety. Goals, phobias, anxiety, breathing exercises, it has everything!!,Really good app that helped me a lot really suggest you download it,App cannot support more than their allotted many note cards. Keeps crashing everytime i open it. \\nWork to be done!!!,How are you supposed to monitor your mood/anxiety if you can only track 3 per day?? It should be unlimited.,It’s great,Not engaging for an eight year old.,According to Moretti and Peled, depression is one of the most common issues of adolescence (2004). Adults experience a clarity of adolescent memories referred to as the reminiscence bump, likely the result of many firsts during this developmental stage (Steinberg, 2014); journaling and clarifying thoughts and emotions on these firsts can help in reflection and self-assurance. Additionally, Steinberg addresses the three R’s of adolescent brain development: reward, relationships, and regulation (2014). MindDoc would be helpful while the adolescent brain is in this stage of neuroplasticity; its design initiates reward-seeking behavior of completing tasks, and the acknowledgement of positive and negative emotions can help a teen learn to self-regulate. If a teen can recognize a pattern in their manic or depressive symptoms, they should be able to project that interpretation into their future and hopefully avoid or at least curb any risky behavior. While this app states that it is appropriate for ages twelve and above, it may be best for adolescents sixteen and older, during the time that their brains are better attuned to problem solving and abstract thought (Moretti & Peled, 2004).,Honestly I downloaded this when I was feeling lonely and down and this app constantly through out the day sends you notifications and checks on you and how your feeling which I really enjoyed honestly and gave me ways to express my feelings it also has some things you can listen to help with things your struggling with and it really calms me especially since it’s hard to meet with a therapist during this time I really really love this app and support it definitely recommend getting if you need someone to talk to and help you explain and figure out your feelings throughout they day❤️ just remember your always loved no matter what circumstances have a good day,Was using this app to track my mood for anxiety and depression and for me, personally, I get triggered easily when exposed to negative thoughts or ideas so having the questions constantly asking if you’re sad or other such questions I found that it did more  bad than good. Most of the time I was in a pretty good mood but then after looking at the analysis it said my mood was critical which I found odd when it was really only a couple times I felt bad. Not everyone is happy 24/7 so it telling you you’re critically depressed because you weren’t in the best mood a few times was somewhat disappointing. I’d look to find an app that’s more uplifting and gives more positive outlook as opposed to negative questioning constantly. 2 stars because the mood tracking 3 times a day was nice.,I like the app and it has helped me manage my emotions and well being. However, I have lost my data several times twice and this is getting frustrating. I subscribed a year of membership for $47 but lost the first period of data not being able to find my account. I contacted customer service asking them to check all my email accounts but non of them were the ones used to subscribe for my membership, so it must’ve been my iOS account. Could not retrieve it till this day. The second time, I didn’t subscribe anymore but still lost the second batch of data after the app signed me out and was unable to log in even if I clearly remembered my email and my password this time. Kept repeating “login failed”.,I’ve been using this app consistently for some time and greatly appreciate the insights I receive from being consistently mindful of my mental state. It helps me identify trends in my emotions, and properly informs my discussions with my therapist.\\n\\nThat being said, the biweekly “Results” are a cause for concern and I’m not sure what they are based off of. I reported a happy and positive mood for 24 out of 28 assessments that I responded to during my most recent time period. I’ve been in a significantly better mood recently, but when given my results from the app as to the current assessment of my mental state, I am being told I am in “Critical need of mental care”\\n\\nIt’s deeply concerning to me that the main algorithm that’s supposed to inform users of their overall mental health seems to be so inaccurate. I’d like to think that this is because of something wrong with a background calculation, but I can’t help feeling that a part of these diagnoses are to try and push me towards paid features.\\n\\nI highly encourage the team reach out to me and help me understand what these mental health results are based off of, because at the moment these insights are drastically missing the mark and it’s damaging my trust with the app.,I was looking for something low maintenance, that allows me to check-in with myself daily, less than 2 minutes at a time (ya know gotta keep it moving!) & this is that App! The reflection portion of this App has helped me share my thoughts, feelings and basic emotions with others as i check-in daily here to keep track of how i’m really feeling. If you’re feeling a little out of your body, confused, sad, depressed, etc. I would absolutely recommend this App to you. Tie this in with your journaling, meditation or however you practice being a better you & I swear by the first month, you will see results!,My only complaint is that standards of “emotional health” feel catered to neurotypical people. I wish it rated emotional health for the individual rather than how it stacks up against “normal” people. Someone with chronic mental illness ends up seeing “poor emotional health” while they’re feeling better. This can be discouraging. \\n\\nMaybe the app could ask people questions early on about what “normal” is for them. Someone with chronic depression, for instance, may have a lower “baseline” than someone without. It doesn’t feel fair to show them consistently that their very best is “moderate”. \\n\\nIn every other way I love the app!,Totally skeptical, figured another greedy app not here to help me personally.  I used the free portions and was so impressed I did purchase the full features and it honestly saved my life. The app can detect your psyche down turns & pain in time to provide a connection between your crisis numbers as well as their crisis professionals. The tips, insights & education modules are in tune with my therapist and myself... a solid triad of care to definitely improve your well being. Thank You for developing such a powerful tool. As a health care professional I use this app and encourage others to as well.,Your first assessment is after 14 days, yet you only a week trial.  That was the first thing that caused me to pause.\\nI’m on my second full day of questions and by 3:30pm it shows I missed my midday and have completed the other two.  I do get up early, but have at least 5 more hours of the day that won’t be accounted for.\\nAnd the last thing I have say something about is the questions themselves.  I don’t know if it is only me, but whenever I finish answering the questions I feel worse than when the reminder went off.  It is like they are trying to take me to a darker place.\\nNot even three days in and I’ve cancelled the free trial.  Now it is time to delete the app, before I feel even worse!,I like how MindDoc allows you to monitor your mood throughout the day and track it over time. Some of the questions can be triggering (not a bad thing just an observation). \\n\\nFor chronic mental health issues, I think the questions should be better worded. For example, many of them ask “are you experiencing ___ more than normal” which is hard to evaluate when your baseline is abnormal. Others will ask “do you often____” and then ask how much that applies to you. I would prefer if it read “do you ____” and then choose how much it applies.,I love the concept. Giving people an opportunity to seek help when they can’t afford it or are too embarrassed to find it. (And for many other situations I’m sure.) Ingenious. After using it on and off for a month or so I realized that not all my emotions fit into the categories provided. I also started to realize the effect the questions had on my state of mind. If I was constantly being asked about my sadness, and I was trying to answer truthfully, it made things worse and I sunk deeper. Perhaps hitting bottom makes you move, but I’m not sure everyone is like that.,I really love this app and have been using it for over a year. It’s a great way to track my mood and keep a journal. It would be perfect if it wasn’t for the flaky notifications. Every time the app updates I don’t get notifications for days or more and then I forget to check in. It skews my results and I hate missing days. Everything else is awesome, from the advice it provides to the questions asked. It just needs to be consistent with notifying users about when to check in.,I found MindDoc (previously Moodpath) when I was struggling with my mental health and wanted to track my emotions and journal my thoughts throughout the day. This app is perfect for that. \\n\\nCurrently, the free version asks you a few questions 3x a day, allows you to record your emotional state and any thoughts, and gives you a report every two weeks. \\n\\nWhat appeals to me is the streamlined nature of the app. It has additional content for those interested, but for me, the free version fufills all that I need it to.\\n\\nThe only flaw is that I had data for about 6 months before they changed the name and structure of the app, resulting in the loss of all my journal enteries. Unfortunately, they were unable to retrieve the data due to the way the app was structured before. Other than this flaw, I really enjoy this app and would recommend it to others.,I love this. As a therapist and someone managing my own mental health issues I have been able to better understand changes in mood and symptoms and relate them to events, patterns, changes in medication, etc. HOWEVER. I feel that it really needs a more sensitive mood scale. I think just two more points on the likert scale would be really helpful. ALSO. I would love to see a specific function to obviously show therapy sessions on the calendar and medication changes.,I’m a therapist and was trying this app out to recommend to clients. The ratings system and evaluations have completely unrealistic expectations for what good mental health looks like. I’ve been rated as having “Poor Mental Health” for several weeks because one day I feel unmotivated or because I haven’t been physically active recently. This thing screams at me every 2 weeks to “seek therapy now” and feels like a marketing tool to get people who may not actually need therapy to sign up for Better Help. Having an off day or even a couple days is very normal. This might actually be damaging people’s perception of good mental health. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND!,The app is good for tracking yourself and gives really helpful tips and tricks. Most of it is free but there is also a paid version that gives you other things like guided meditations.\\n\\nBut the thing that made me rate it a two is that I can’t get the app to notify me when new questions are due. I have notifications on, the app is up to date. I’ve uninstalled/ reinstalled and nothing seems to get it to work. Notifications use to be fine and the app does remind me at random sometimes but I can’t get it to notify me on a regular basis. If I could get that to work again, I’d give this app a 5.,I would be very adamant on keeping up on my mood posting on the app. I’ve used it for 4 months. I absolutely hate the 14 day results. For 2 months all my moods have been good and very good but yet the results say I have critical emotional health and to seek therapy ASAP. I have absolutely nothing bad going on in life. I’ve answered no when asked if I was being active and just other small stuff like that. It seems if you answer no to something you’re “suppose” to do, then it automatically docks you and says you need help. It’s super unrealistic. You can not be happy 100% of the time but just because I have 1 bad day a month, doesn’t mean my health is in critical condition.,It is really helping me keep track of my feelings through out the day. I haven’t finished the first 14 days yet. So idk how the first review works. Hopefully I will see improvement. I like being able to see how I’ve felt over the last week. I didn’t realize my emotions were so up and down. It is very important to be completely honest when answering these questions. Otherwise what is the point?,after two weeks of using minddoc, there’s a lot to love. it’s filled its role as a mood tracker perfectly for me, enabling me to be more aware of how and what i’m feeling and when. it also supplements my counseling well and helps me to better describe how i’ve been feeling since my last session.\\n\\nhowever, after creating the maximum number of custom emotions i could as a free user and then deciding they weren’t relevant, i deleted them thinking i could replace them. i learned that this isn’t possible, and instead the app redirects you to the option to upgrade.\\n\\ni’ll absolutely add the fifth star if this could be fixed and perhaps allowed for free users to have a set number of custom emotion “slots.” thanks for creating minddoc, as well as for taking the time to read my lil review! :-),I have been using this app for about two months. Everything has been going well until recently, I don’t get any notifications for questions. Also, I can’t answer questions either by just going on the application during the times of my questions. There is no option or notifications for me to answer questions so I can’t track my daily moods.\\n\\nEdit: after contacting the developer and almost 3 weeks later, I haven’t been able to track anything. I also did not receive any assistance with this issue. I will be deleting this app.,This app works well in everything it’s supposed to do except sending out notifications. For some reason (regardless of my settings) I don’t get any notifications from this app. I’ve checked the settings multiple times to make sure they didn’t get turned off for whatever reason, but I never receive them. This is pretty problematic for me, as I have bad memory and don’t remember to log in and do the questions without notifications.,I’ll admit, this app was really good at first. It was a healthy way to document my emotions, and it was fun seeing my months light up in different colors! However, out of the blue it wouldn’t let me access my previous months without a MindDoc subscription. The only reason why I downloaded this app was to track my emotions throughout the months, and this paywall completely eliminates my purpose for having this app. I’m disappointed. At least specify that months are going to be blocked off unless you have a MindDoc subscription. Please do better next time.,i really love this app. i remember downloading it a while ago and i just found it again. it really made me feel like i could actually accept that i was depressed bc i denied it for so long. there are also some good free exercises that help you calm down and just in general think you should try it and see if it will fit you.,I’ve really enjoyed using this app. It’s very streamlined, just a mood tracker and journal. Perfect!\\n\\nUnfortunately, when Moodpath switched to MindDoc, I got logged out (forgot the password) and lost my data. It won’t send me an email to reset it. I’m seeing other reviewers experiencing the same problem. I’ve already contacted the support email with my issue and still waiting on a response. \\n\\nI’ll update this review to five stars when it gets fixed because it’s worked great up till this point. Thank you!,Notifications haven’t been working since like 5 days now. I’ve tried it all but nothing would seem to fix it just like last time (prior being fixed with the update). \\n\\nPlease help. I try to enter moods when I remember, but it’s just not the same as getting the actual notifications from the app. I’m a subscriber, so I want to get the best out of the app. It’s been of great help. Thanks.,I would definitely rate this high. The questions they ask just make sense, and they provide a free connection if you have suicidal thoughts. I haven\\'t connected for personal reasons, but it feels so encouraging knowing that they give this option. \\n\\nLike I said, the questions make so much sense and it helps me realize what habits and thinking patterns really go into deeper issues.,An opportunity to keep a safe entry of your thoughts and preoccupations, clean layout, notifications are consistent and motivate me to take a few minutes to do what they say, reflect. Wish there were more mood options for those of us with a struggling budget. \\n\\nGreat app, highly recommend,Not sure why you can only see a months worth of history in the free version of the “ track your mood over time app” but what’s worse is that the free articles are kinda useless, aren’t very insightful, and don’t really give a reason to see what else you could get with the paid version\\nIt’s a good idea but the free version is bare bones and there isn’t any incentive to pay for the premium version \\n\\n… so it’s not really that good,I love to be able to track how I’m feeling daily. Especially if you’re truly honest of how you feel at that moment. It also helps me to realize I’m actually having a good day or achieving something that day. Helps me to focus on some of the positive.,It’s the only app I actually look forward to the notifications for. The reminders are helpful in taking a step back and reflecting on how you feel. Looking forward to using it more and more.,Every since I switched from Moodpath to Mind Doc, this app has been giving me problems. I never get notifications/reminders at all even though I have it set for notifications. After answering the daily questions and typing a journal entry, It will randomly not save my entries and I have to repeat the process all over again. I had no problems with Moodpath idk what’s going on.,I realized Im always in a good mood from my logs on the app but i feel lime with feelings that are normal that everyone gets this app is like WHOOP u need to get help right now you have critical mental health. I will say my mental health isnt worthy of an award but I wouldn’t say im in dire need of therapy. Like im chilling. Anyone else or do I actually need help?,Hi I have a question about the change of the app. So I downloaded this app when it was called Moodpath (I think) and I had days logged in March-May and now that has disappeared with the update? Why did this happen? If you could let me know I’d be grateful thank you!!!,I love this app, but it asks so many questions that it makes me not want to track my mood anymore. The amount of questions is so annoying and makes it feel like a chore rather than something to help me. I miss the days when I only was asked three questions per entry!,This app is so well designed. I have ever had an app which I love to see the notifications. I enjoy answering the questions and the report is very informative. It helps me to check in with my feelings and emotions. Extremely helpful!,This app is pretty helpful but I’m still at the questions thing and it just stopped giving me questions around day 15 and now it says that I’m answering the minimum of questions to get a result. If this is a glitch please fix this soon :) great app though,I love this app for its functions but I was very disappointed recently to lose my entire history with it. After using the app for over a year, it logged me out one day and now they’re saying I don’t have an account with them and my email isn’t registered. All that data is irretrievable.,I’ve been struggling a lot recently, more than I can put into words. I really love how this app has questions that I really wish people would ask me right now. Overall, such a great app!!,The app is great but I have had this message to update the app for over a month now. The app was updated and the message won’t go away. It’s pretty annoying to see that each time I get on the app. I emailed customer support and they were no help- they said the message would disappear.,I am glad that I decided to download this and keep track of how I was feeling everyday. After 14 days it gave me an overview and it helped me understand why I have been feeling the way I do. Thank you Mind doc,I use this frequently and enjoy the two week insights.  The negative emotions & situations emotions could use some more variety like worried or anxious. Other than that a fine mental health application.,•I’m a teen & some of the questions don’t apply to me. Teen mode?\\n\\n•I am doing therapy. MindDoc is like Aah you need therapy! And I’m like yeah I know that’s why I am can there be some option to tell them “ya I’m good I’m doing that.” The same with medication^\\n\\n•Also please add stuff for more diverse mental illnesses than anxiety and depression. Thank you!,I downloaded this app and I answered about your questions, Then I went to create an account and every time I press on create account it does nothing. So I’m not going to be able to save my progress. I sent feedback to the app developers with my technical issue but who knows when it will be resolved.,I am a teenager but I’m trying to use this app to help with harming you know but I can’t pay for helping with my self confidence and other stuff like that. But I can’t pay for it and neither will my mom because she thinks I won’t use it. But besides that this app helps as much as it can.,I’ve been using this for a while now and I really like it I would recommend getting it if your having a hard time with your mental health,This app has definitely helped me see how I am and how I feel. I do wish you could go into more depth then yes or no. Some questions are a little more complicated than yes or no,My app keeps glitching. It’ll send me a reminder to do my questions and when I open the app, it won’t load the questions. Or it’ll completely log me out. Very disappointing as this app really is super helpful for tracking my mood.,Although I probably should set an alarm to remind myself to respond to questions, Mind Doc is one way to gauge where I am. Of course this is not geography but how centered I am. A centered ‘me’ can move with focus, purpose and confidence.,I\\'ve found it very beneficial to have a way to check in and consistently access how I\\'m feeling. It helps me to be more thoughtful about my life and mental health.,When you first download the app there is this texting sort of format, I click to get started and get to be end of the stream and I can’t click continue, it’s blacked out. I’ve tried getting off and on the app, deleting and getting back on it. What is the problem? Is anyone else having this problem?,i have a hard time remembering how i was feeling and why i was feeling that way after an hour but i use this app to track my mood, and it’s really helped in my therapy. it’s coming up to a year of using and i will continue to use it for many more years.  i recommend this app for anyone, whether you’re struggling or not,My therapist recommended this app and it has truly changed my life. This app has helped me so much especially with my anxiety and my depression states. I recommend this app for EVERYONE!!!,It gives me something to look forward to throughout the day. It gives me hope and comfort.,What I meant as more things like telling people listen and get your free try out for 19 to get counselor and give out WAYS that are free I can tell why nobody like it I love but come on!???,I haven’t gotten notifications for MONTHS. I’ve turned the notification settings on and off several times both in my phone’s settings and the app’s settings. Over a month ago I got a pop up message saying that it was a known issue and they fixed it but nothing’s changed.,Usually after an update the notifications to answer questions just stop. Overall a great app, and an awesome way to help me keep track of my emotional health,i’ve been using this app for over a year now. i really love the idea of this app and the mood tracker and everything about it. i just wish it had more options for the feelings such as “angry” or “frustrated” for when i’m feeling more than just upset. i wish the questions weren’t just repeated as well. it’s pretty good overall but basic in the long run and i really don’t want to spend money for it to be repetitive but more in depth.,I haven’t been receiving notifications for any of my questions or been able to answer them when I go into the app. This issue has been going on for over a month and it’s still not fixed. Extremely displeased.,App seems great but wasn’t for me. I cancelled my subscription but was still charged, trying to find a contact or reach out through the support button takes you to a broken site, the actual site has no support option.,i absolutely love this app, and it’s been a part of my daily routine for a while now. but currently i’m unable to do any of the questions. it keeps saying that i’m missing them, when i’m not able to do them in the first place. besides this new recent bug i completely adore this app,I used to love this app until they decided to make you pay to see your progress. you can’t even look back on your past months anymore that was the whole point. i’m really disappointed. gonna have to find a new app,I have been using this for half a year and lost all my mood data. It wouldn’t let me log in the past few days and crashed every time I tried to. Today I got it open but it reset all my data. It still crashes when I try to log in,I used to love the ease of the app, but after an update it won’t let me log back in. I’ve requested a password reset and nothing. I’ve emailed support and nothing. Bad part is I paid for the yearly subscription in December 2020 and now I’m stuck with something I can’t even use.,The app updated and all of the logs I had made prior to that were gone. The strengths of this app were that it tracked my mood over the long term for comparison and I could journal about my day. Without my data those functions are useless.,i think this app had a good concept, but don’t you think it’s kinda stupid asking mentally ill people to answer questions three times a day and when they struggle to do so, they get a bunch of notifications saying to answer the questions and on the app it will tell u that you shouldn’t be missing questions. it makes me feel guilty for forgetting. i don’t know if this is just my experience but i forgot to do questions and they withdrew my results. extremely unsatisfied with this app.,Woke up this morning and all my data - well over a years worth - was gone. \\n\\nSent feedback, no response. \\n\\nI should have known something was going wrong when they changed the name and started flogging subscriptions.,Tried it out for the free trial. Didn’t get to spend much time learning the app and answering questions. So I decided to keep it for 1 more month and give it a chance.. Bad idea!! I was charged for a FULL YEAR and can’t get in touch with anyone to adjust and provide refund..,Forced me to update to MindDoc from MoodPath and offered no way to save data. Lost all of my data for 6 months.\\n\\nUpdate: AND notifications don\\'t work so it doesn\\'t remind me to update it at all anymore. Worthless app now.,I’ve used moodpath/MindDoc since 2019. I barely ever get notifications and the server is consistently down. Makes me wish I didn’t renew subscription,You used to be able to add custom emotions for free but now it’s paid?? Why??,this honestly gives good advice and information as well as an easy way to track your mood and behavior. it feels like a perfect in-between of therapy and journaling,Have been using since late 2019. All my data was erased last month when I updated the app. Probably won’t continue to use.,Is anyone else experiencing this? I open the app and it just gets stuck loading.,Very cool and helpful. The free version is great as well,i loved this app but recently i haven’t gotten the option to answer questions anymore. i loved the self reflection that the questions provided but now i am not able to do that anymore.,$60-$80 for \"professional help\" from another app,For some reason every time I log into the app it won’t let me do anything and this has happened recently probably about a month ago… I log into the app and the only thing which is visible is my profile but everything else like the months in my diary and all of my logs are blank… I don’t know how to explain it but it’s really weird and I haven’t been able to log how I feel and everything of that sort and it’s made me a bit frustrated because this was the way I used to keep check of myself you know.Help!,I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder two years ago, and was told that I’ve probably been suffering from it much longer than I realized. Fast forward to 2020 - I became a first-time mom at 38 years old, suffered from postpartum depression, and just when I was starting to find my footing, the world was immediately hurled into the COVID-19 pandemic. The stress wreaked havoc on my body. Everyday I felt like I was physically drowning; my chest was cramped, my muscles ached, I was permanently exhausted but couldn’t sleep, and my brain was foggy. I tried taking anxiety medication and it made me extremely nauseous, which further triggered my anxiety. I thought I was doomed; I felt so helpless. Then I read Dan Harris’s book, 10% Happier, and I figured if meditation helped him, maybe it would help me. Now I use the app daily, in conjunction with a daily routine that involves yoga, reasonably healthy eating, supplements as recommended by my physician, and continued communication and collaboration with my support net of friends and family. It’s part of a bigger picture, and it has made a world of difference. Physically, the chest tightness and muscular tension have decreased significantly. And mentally I find myself much more resilient in the face of stress, especially the kind induced by the intrusive irrational fears that come with GAD. Thank you to the 10% Happier team. In my case, “10% Happier” would be an understatement.,Ten percent happier is the best meditation app hands down for me. This is the only app I found myself use consistently, not because of sheer will power but because I am actually very interested in the contents. I have logged over 380 minutes on the app last time I checked! Each module focuses on a theme, beginners meditation, coping with stress, and forming habits, etc. Each module consists of multiple lessons and is led by an experienced and insightful instructor. A typical lesson begins with a short interview and convo between Dan Harris, the host, and the meditation “guru”. Dan asks questions on behalf of me and other people new to meditation and this format really helps to set the stage. I am being guided through every lesson and usually learn tidbit of new skill each lesson in being able to introspect better. I can’t say thank you enough for the wonderful work the host and the guest speakers have done to deliver this easy to use app; my world has become a little calmer and better every day.,I am a single female, 66 yrs young, who just retired Oct 2020. I had planned to retire end of 2020, but COVID moved up that date. I am very happy with this decision, and more content every day. It took some time to get here for sure! Allot of this contentment is due to you Dan - and your ten percent happier team. \\nI stared listening to your free podcast while on furlough March-July, along with several others podcasts.   When I went back to work it wasn’t long before I knew I was ready to retire NOW.  I worked in the travel industry and LOVED my job in Group Sales- but the workplace and the job was never going to be the same. At least while I was there. So I retired early, and was excited about my decision. \\nAs you may imagine- the real challenge for me was the isolation, which I knew was coming. I was loosing the social aspect of the workplace and with COVID there was no socializing with friends. In the beginning I had some really dark days.  Many questioned my decision to retire at this time. I heard your ad for the New Years meditation challenge and signed up. I have since bought the subscription to your app- (thanks so much for the discount!!) and continue to learn more about meditation. \\nI have now gone through 3 months and feel more optimistic and excited then ever before! I can definitely see and feel the difference in how I am setting in. \\nI’m a very satisfied customer👍\\nThank you!\\nJeri Hawkins,Liked: clean, minimalist interface. Professionally made audio tracks that allow for space and silence at times. My partner is usually skeptical of meditation and calls it “woo-y”. He was willing to try this with me. It provided me relief when a close family member underwent surgery recently, and when my partner was stressed the night before a grueling interview. I think the quiet healing space this app helped us create on-the-go was precious for overthinkers or high-achievers. \\n\\nHoped: Hmm, couple discount? I want to buy him a subscription and use it occasionally myself. We will go long distance for a short while before we reunite again. Wish to see logs from each of us and nudge each other. Social support/app support would be lovey. Is that possible? Besides, can I follow certain teachers? Didn’t seem straight forward to search for their content.,The app is very much in alignment with Dan Harris’ books on the topic in philosophy and approach; if you’ve enjoyed them you’re probably going to like the app a lot. \\n\\nI’m a beginning meditator, and am finding the sessions to be clear, positive and encouraging - and the coaches are all great. There are courses dealing with many of the things that beset us in life, and a number of shorter sessions as well.\\n\\n The one thing that I wish was added is a continuing refresh of additional 1 minute meditations. It’s a very stealthy - and successful- approach to luring you into another 5-10 minutes of meditating. \\n\\nBTW, I think the style of coaches is really important. I’ve been using the  Calm app - for sleep stories - but am unable to use most of their meditation sessions; I’m so put off by most of the meditation coaches’ intonation - the  breathy ‘I’m smiling beatifically from my trip to the ashram’ kind of voice. I know I should be more accepting, but I just start gritting my teeth.  The one exception was Jeff Warren, who’s terrific - and he’s on the 10 app as well. I actually signed up for 10 app partly because he’s one of the coaches.\\n\\nI was really pleased to find that all of the coaches bring a sense of being kind, supportive and pretty grounded in the real world. Overall, it’s very worthwhile.,I cannot say enough good things about this app that introduces novices and aids intermediate and even advanced meditators.  I use the 30 day guest passes in my psychiatry practice all the time to real benefit: teaching about focus, non-judgement, self and other knowledge,love, compassion.  Recognizing the “golden moment” when our minds have wandered and with pleasure at awakening, going back to our intended path with resilience and patience.  There cannot be a better cognitive reframe than celebrating awakening rather than cursing loss of focus!  I have such  gratitude for each of the teachers who carefully and compassionately introduce us to their style, ourselves, others and the world around us with tools to help us neither cling to nor cringe from the feelings and thoughts that pass.  Such wisdom in a little app!  Many, many thanks for your noble striving.,So I am using what is available for free. \\n\\nOne of the problems I see with similar apps is how very little you get unless you pay for a subscription. And for many of us who can’t afford it or do not want another subscription, you are given very slim pickings. \\n\\nI have found that 10 percent happier is very generous. You have at least 20 (maybe 30 meditations) you can choose from for free, at varying lengths of times—which is perfect for those with busy lives or short attention spans (especially beginners). They also do have longer mediations or light/no guidance ones available for free.\\n\\nI do wish we had more than one sleep meditation available, and I am not sure how to feel about putting the 2021 meditations behind a paywall after letting people listen to them for free for a short time.\\n\\nBut otherwise? This is a good service and great meditation device that is perfect for young and old folks alike. I hope you continue this nice balance of variety of free/paid meditations. Although, for future consideration, I would like it if we can instead sample a meditation and then pay for it without paying a subscription.,I’m a psychotherapist and recommend meditation to virtually all of my clients and use of an app for those who are new to the practice.  This app is well worth the price.  I’ve grown fond of so many of the ‘teachers’ in the app. They feel like old friends I can count on any time of the day. Most all of the meditations are guided, some heavily, some less so.  If you are at a place where you can just sit and meditate on your own, probably an app (or no app) like Insight Timer, is better for you.  But if you’re like me and need a push/ guide this is definitely for you. I It’s helped me tremendously throughout the pandemic and I plan to continue meditating with my online teachers.  Peace.,I love this app, it has been my support in this last challenging year, but one thing that would help me in my vocation of helping others... (I am a therapist to college age adults).. would be if I had the option as a member to send any one lecture/meditation or even a whole course to a young client to use. If it is of value, they might subscribe when it is in their budget, but at minimum it might help them past a tough spot , and help me help them. This is how blogs, podcasts, even songs “go viral” with this next generation, why  not adapt this into your business plan? And besides, Dan’s snarky anti-woo-woo schtick is perfect soft sell  for young adults who have come of age in a time of cynicism and fear, but crave heart and connection.,It’s been a couple of years since I started using 10%. I think I saw Dan’s personal story and was so struck by his honesty, that I came to the app. I had previously been using a different meditation app, but the personal info that the teachers share on 10% make me feel connected. They share a bit and I find myself shaking my head in agreement. “Yes!” I don’t feel so different from everyone. Here are these gifted, smart and important people who have been meditating for quite some time and they STILL feel things that I feel. Many days the storm in my head is calmed because of this app. I am truly, deeply grateful for Dan, the app and all of the teachers. My life is better because of you all.,I was adamant that I would not be good at meditation because I could not imagine slowing the madhouse of squirrels in my brain for even a moment. Ten Percent Happier showed me both that I can slow them down and that being good at meditation isn’t really the point. Taking the time to be guided through “now” is plenty good enough. I started with a TPH challenge during a time of crisis - I love the lesson/context setting that proceeds those meditations but now do a morning “daily” meditation plus a sleep meditation each night to shut down. As a lifelong insomniac, I have to be honest and admit the shut down helps. I’ve tried other apps but this is my preference. Oh yeah, I read Dan Harris’ book too.,Although there are countless meditation apps out there, many of them even free, I LOVE Ten Percent Happier. I love the short talk before each meditation-it helps me to set an intention and get in the right space. And I’ve loved the various coaches along the way. I find that at this point in my meditation journey I actually need the guidance, and also the nudge (reminder) to make time for it each day. It’s much needed time for myself, that in just 15 short minutes, either starts my day or resets my day in such a positive way. I love it so much I’m gifting it to my little sister, who I know, as a busy mom, like myself, rarely takes time for herself, and it is just so important. ❤️,This is where it all started for me with meditation and even though I’ve tried other paid and free apps none compare. This has the best instructors, the most variety of content and tracking that keeps you motivated to keep your streak going. I love everything about it and can’t say enough good things. You can even ask questions and they have a dedicated team that will respond pretty quickly I might add. Don’t hesitate to sign up for their membership plan. To me it’s worth it because it’s changed the way I live my life, interact with others and look at myself. Oh Happy Day. 10% fan all the way. Thanks Dan and team!,I started using meditation apps several years ago to deal with grief and have dabbled off and on since then.  The structured Ten Percent Happier courses led by a variety of meditation experts along with the singles mean there is a way to pause & reflect regardless of the challenges of the day.\\n\\nIt\\'s been several months since I subscribed, and a couple of features would be welcome.  Please consider adding a way to sort the main page so that either the unexplored courses are listed first, or we have the ability to rearrange the page to suit our own agenda.  I would also be grateful if one of the buttons at the bottom of the page would take me to either favorites or downloads.,I really enjoyed this challenge. The speakers were all so unique in approach, and so down to earth and encouraging. I thought the time allotted for the meditations was very doable and the added talks were informative.( I have been meditating for quite a few years, so I did wish for more quiet during some of the days meditations, but of course could do that on my own later;)\\nThank you for all you do! So amazing. I’m always on the hunt for some way to help my children in their 20’s adopt a meditation habit, I can see how greatly this would enhance their lives. Have forwarded this share link with them, thank you for that too!! No takers yet but🤞🏼,I found out about Ten Percent Happier via the Tim Ferris app when Dan Harris was interviewed. To preface, I am a first gen graduate student living alone 3,000 miles away from home in a pandemic. To be frank, I’ve been at my lowest but I have been able to slowly grow the confidence and mindfulness to be myself again. I don’t credit the app fully, but it has helped me build a enriching routine. Every morning, I do a ten min meditation followed by ten min of yoga. I am feeling good in the morning. The app is a bit clunky so I usually stick to the daily meditation and sometimes venture to the talks. Anyways, I am enjoying the app! Worth the try.,So great.  So nice to see kind faces first thing in the morning. I’ve never been able to “sit” like so many traditions say you have to do, for extended periods of time to “meditate”.  I appreciate the 10 minute time.  That’s doable. I appreciate the lightness and humanness Dan and his guests bring.  They are just folk too, and if they can develop this practice, perhaps I can too.  I love how we get to learn and practice different techniques instead of being told sit still and empty your mind. \\n\\nI have been listening quietly in bed 5:30, 6 in the morning, so I don’t wake my husband and it’s a fabulous, positive, hopeful way to start my day.  Thank you so much.,I\\'ve been to \"manage subscription\" on three different devices, the App Store and neither of themDoes this app give you the option to cancel your subscription. It is incredibly frustrating that it is so easy to buy an app yet you cannot cancel the subscription without going to a chat room, getting disconnected so now I\\'m putting in this review so that perhaps someone from the app can help me cancel what I no longer wish to subscribe to. In fact, I\\'ve requested a refund for the last three months as I\\'ve been wrestling with this. I did enjoy it while I was using it but I have moved on and I would highly recommend it it\\'s content.,As a psychologist with a personal meditation practice and a mindfulness informed private therapy practice I explore many meditation apps. I have been checking in with Ten Percent since early on and done several of the courses/packs and found them all really solid. Recently I found the podcast and have been really impressed with subject content and quality. Joining the anxiety challenge along with some family members and hopefully some patients to whom I have recommended and planning to make it a more regular go to in my practice moving forward.,I was in the hospital for 26 days fighting Covid. I returned home to my family a week before Christmas. Things are going well physically for me, but I need some work on the mental side of things. It was very difficult spending those days away from all I knew, family and surroundings. Also, I spent many of those days in fear of my health and future. I’m home now, but I have developed more anxiety than what I already carry around with me. So, this site and practice has been helping me deal with that stuff. Find it very successful and I look forward to it each day!,I wanted to start meditating for years but couldn’t get into it. I had tried other apps and still didn’t feel compelled to make it a lasting habit or routine. When I found the ten percent app, that’s when I was actually able to meditate consistently. \\n\\nI love all the different teachers and courses and the dashboard that keeps track of your meditation streak and hours spent meditating. \\n\\nIt’s a great app to teach you how to meditate and it keeps you engaged! I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in starting to meditate consistently :),I started my journey with meditation & mindfulness with 10 % in January, the daily month challenge & I was hooked!!  I love Dan’s exuberance & fun way of explaining thinking!  I am now doing “Meditation for Skeptics”!!  I’m really enjoying, learning that my constant thinking is not really a bad thing, it’s all in how I perceive my thoughts, return to a mindfulness practice instead of a mindless practice.  And practice, practice, practice🤩  l love the way Jeff Warren explains how everyone does this & he has funny ways to lighten up what you are thinking so the thoughts don’t seem so big!  I highly recommend 10% App!!,Hi, I am a newbie to this app. I found out about it from Jeff Warren who I was listening to on the calm app. So I’m comparing the both. The big difference I notice is that in between the guidance of your coaches there is pure silence, and on the calm app there is a beautiful sound of babbling Brooks and birds singingI’m trying to decide which one I like better. Honestly I think I like them both. They both have their advantages. And disadvantages. But this guidance was absolutely perfect for me this morning. The only reason I left off a star is because I’m still contemplating whether I like the pure silence in between the sentences of guidance or not. Thank you,My wife and I have meditated using the daily dose everyday for almost a year.  I have been meditating a long time and am very familiar with some of the teachers in this app who are actually some of the best most well known meditation teachers in the country.  Without the app and it’s structure my meditation would not be this consistent.   By meditating at the same time each day together my wife and I can sit together in silent intimacy that helps ground our relationship.  I would recommend this app to anyone, whether experienced or a beginner.,Just finished my first meditation from the basics course.  I feel good!\\nI’m 47 and have never meditated.  Buddhist philosophy and principles have always resonated with me.  But I never found my way here.  I just finished DH’s book 10%.  I found him via a podcast on Tim F.  Decided to investigate.  And I’m so glad I did.  Got a lot out of the book and downloaded the app half way through.  I feel I’ve got a long way to go and a lot to learn.  But it feels like a safe and open space and I’m feeling energized and excited to begin.  Just beginning... Thank you!!!,This app has been a great help to me and the instructors are so good. I have learned so much. However I struggle with Dan Harris bringing his reporter hat into the app. When I open this app to learn or do a meditation I am using it to do just that. I don’t want to be reminded constantly about COVID and the political uprisings in this country.  I know people struggle with these issues but let the user take the lessons and apply them to their own needs. Sometimes just opening this app causes me stress when I see the titles and trying to focus on lesson is difficult with the constant reminders of COVID and politics and how bad things are.,A friend sent me the link to this app. I was reluctant to spend one dime on any app that helps with what this app claim to, Simply too many bad experiences and waste of money. I have just started this up but already by reading did many aspects of the things I go through in life has me excited and hopeful, it’s working and I’ve only done less than one, going to do it one more time and then move on but I can tell you just having it feels like a security blanket, like insurance of sorts for the mind,These guided meditations have really amplified my personal practice. I usually sit for 20-30 minutes in silence focusing on my breath and having these to add to that practice is very helpful. When I feel stuck or unmotivated to practice, I love turning to Ten Percent Happier to help me get back on my path. \\n\\nI wish this app also included a timer to include personal silent meditation in the charting of progress. I often use an alarm with a gong or singing bowl sound to mark the end of a silent meditation. The inclusion of something like that would bump my review up to 5 stars. \\n\\nThanks Ten Percent Happier!!,So thankful for the offer of free membership to healthcare workers in this tough time. The single meditations each day are an amazing way to get into a meditation practice — it takes all the guesswork out of it, no decision making required. You can simply open the app, head to the single of the day and enjoy. This has made it so easy to make mindfulness a habit, and the benefits are so far reaching in my life. There’s a ton to explore when you want to take the practice deeper, and the teachers are all wonderful. Thank you Ten Percent Happier! ❤️,I have spent the last few years waking up to a guided meditation. I’ve tried a number of other meditation apps, and while I have enjoyed each of them for a time this one has the most depth and breadth in my view. The fact that they have so many different meditation teachers who have been practicing for so long really helps to expand my practice. I have long been a fan of the TPH podcast and I’m glad I finally have the app to go with it. They do compliment each other very well.,This app has changed my life and consequently the lives of everyone around me. I don’t know if I’m “better” or more enlightened, but I know I look forward to my meditations all day! Beautiful, intuitive, easy to use, incredible teachers. And I love that they are offering free for medical and essential personnel and teachers during the Coronavirus pandemic; way to step up and really help people who need it! Love the tracker, LOVE the courses, love the talks. So much wisdom and compassion contained in one little app! Thank you a million times!,I am so grateful for this app. It has enhanced my practice in ways I never thought possible. The diverse group of meditation instructors come from a variety of disciplines. Some of the meditations touch me in spiritual ways, and some appeal to my scientific curiosity. This app is so beautifully structured. I love the short talks between Dan and the instructor that precede the guided meditations. I almost feel like I have had a personal meditation coach. I have been using this almost daily for a year. I am definitely 10% happier, if not more.,I’ve never reviewed an app before, so that should count for how much I love this app. Like so many others, I was a meditation failure (in my mind and in my efforts!) This app is user friendly and makes meditation delightful. I love the categories so I can tailor the practice to fit my own needs. The videos are fun and the meditation is not overwhelming. I often look forward to my next day! I’m totally happy with everything and gladly subscribed after 5 days. I’m 30 days in and can’t wait for more. Thank you!,I have been using the App from over a year now and ten percent happier app changed my life. I will remain forever grateful. I have been meditating from several years but I truly understood the meaning of meditation only from this App. I love the changes to the singles tab. I have one wish, if there was a way to track heart rate on the app it would be phenomenal. I want to know how breathing works during meditation and which meditation actually calms me down. Thank you for the phenomenal job and grateful forever,the free podcast was where i started. i was hooked immediately. a vibrant community of truly unique individuals tell engaging stories about their lives and careers, and about how meditation fit in to that. now that i’ve joined the subscription portion of TPH, I feel excited and hopeful that this crew of mindful practitioners is going to be alongside me as I strive to gain a little control over my future choices. Dan Harris at the helm is a fun first mate with a refreshing sense of humor and vibrance! \\nI will give it 4.8 stars now, a total of 5 stars when It can easily find the very quiet guided meditations easily.,I don’t know that I’ve ever written a review before, and that title sounds rather hyperbolic, but that’s the only way to describe what this app and subscription have done for me. I listened to Dan’s book of the same name about two years ago, and it definitely demystified meditation and mindfulness practice. But I still struggled to do it regularly, even with other apps to guide me.\\n\\nEverything about this app changed that. Dan’s down-to-earth style (along with that of his guests), the very practical and easy sessions of\\nvarying lento and topics, and the pleasing interface make me want to do it. And in the doozy of a year of 2020, I NEEDED to do it. \\n\\nRegular short sessions have helped me understand how to get behind the waterfall of my thoughts and see them for what they are and to find calm in each moments. Or more like 10% more moments - keeping it real and to the title!,My friend recommended this to me after we talked about ALL the apps out there that’s are just so flooded and without structure and how they don’t seem to stick. She said this definitely made her 10% happier and said I should try. I love it. I’ve done it 2x a day now for over a week and feel much better. I love that each day there is a meditation waiting for you so you’re not overwhelmed by choices and then the nighttime ones to help you wind down. Recommended,This app is a practice of renewal, restart, and rejuvenation. An act each day of becoming more of who we want to be by learning how to stretch that which is before us. I have been a chaser for so much of my life, never quite settling anywhere and feeling as if I am floating. This app pulls on the tethers of connection, ties me down not to weigh me down, but rather to be a part of that which is around and within me. Thank you 10%, I look forward to practicing with you tomorrow.,It’s interesting how difficult staying consistent can be. It’s only 10-15mins and improves almost everything about my life. After 6-8 months I meditate most days. This app really does make a difference and I recommend it to everyone. It makes the process really easy and compelling to stay consistent. The bite sized lesson are really cool and allows you to put in work where you are struggling. Hope you get a chance to try it!,At last 10% Happier- a site for people like me who don’t have to have background music or any other distractions. Dan has meditation courses. I’m learning about good habits from a psychologist and meditation teacher-so I can use my whole brain. I also find single topics that are a quick way to get more peace. Every night I listen to a teacher who helps me to sleep. So far I have logged close to 800 mindful days so you know 10% Happier tops my chart.,This has been the easiest user friendly tool I’ve used. I really like that it shows progress and acknowledges my time and effort because I’m a human and I like validation. Besides that the teachers/guides are lovely and kind and I feel like they care. It’s nice to feel a connection to start the day. \\nThanks 10% guys for all the hard word you’ve put into creating such a lovely daily experience and helping me find the start of the path :),I enjoy the fact that this app has a bit of discussion as well as the meditation. The discussion part helps to explain not only that there are a number of ways to meditate, but also you can then deal with specific things like anxiety. By understanding something, by learning more about it we are better able to deal with it. The people are real and open in talking about issues.,I’ve tried meditation periodically over the last few years, but was never able to make it part of my daily routine. I took the 21 day challenge and have meditated every day. I am finding that I am less anxious and more mindful of my surroundings and people with whom I interact. Dan and the other professionals in this program are down to earth, non-judgmental, and the sessions are both relaxing and stimulating. Thanks Dan!,This popped up on screen in the App Store about a year ago offering one week free.  I had tried meditation before without success, but 10% seemed like a modest goal and I liked the spirit of the offering overall, so I took it.  \\nNow, one year later, it is increasingly speaking to me and the authenticity of the teachers and leaders of the meditation rings true.  It is not a quick cure for anything, but a practice that leads toward deeper understanding and contentment in life.  \\nThank you .,This app is by far the best meditation app I’ve tried, and that’s because of the variety and quality of the teachers. I love the option of doing a series of related meditations, or choosing from the “singles” list. The option of reaching out to a real instructor for coaching and support is great, and the challenges are timely and relevant. As a psychotherapist, I recommend this app to my clients when they are interested in diving deeper into mindfulness and meditation.,The content on this app is worth every penny it costs, probably more. High quality, curated guided meditations from a diverse group of experts. You can choose the topics that fit the areas of your life where you seek improvement or healing. You can take part in challenges. Everything is digestible and challenging at the same time. It’s perfect for a beginner meditator trying to build a practice and improve her quality of life.,I’m a meditation newbie and found this application after listening to the podcast. I was hesitant to try it, but decided to take the plunge. I have found it has motivated me to use it daily. There are many different types of meditations and there are teachings as well. It’s nice not having to search the internet for different types meditations only to find they are so-so.  All are quality and all are in one application.,I am way more than 10% happier since I started using this app. It’s been 14 months since I started and people close to me tell me I have a calming presence. I can tell you that is a direct result of doing your meditations on a very regular basis. I love the variety of experts and truly useful tools. Plus my personality is more like Dan Harris’ so I can totally relate. Thank you for putting this together and please don’t stop.,This was supposed to be free for a month. I tried it thinking it would be free. I thought it was free for 30 days. I was charged before I even tried the app.  I was charged $99 dollars right away. Money is very tight for us right now. Thought I would try it as we have a lot going on. I was very sick and I have a daughter battling stage four cancer and her prognosis is poor. When I saw I was charged immediatelyI was shocked. I tried it  about 3 times. It is a good app but no way was I in a position to pay right away. Thought I could try it then make a decision and see if I had enough funds to pay for it or would have to cancel it.,I was originally going to say this app changed my life, which it kind of did, but more so it gave me some insight to see how I could change if I continued on the path. Myself a few years ago wouldn’t recognize me today. I’m so much more compassionate, patient and kind with others and, equally important, to myself. Thank you Dan, teachers and team at 10%. Keep doing the good work. - James.,I am incredibly grateful that my sister in law discovered the 10% App and told us about it. I have a farming operation in Africa and a wonderful but incredibly hectic life. I had temporarily slipped out of a deeper meditation practice .. this is honestly the first meditation App that has worked for me. It has been spot on .. on so many levels. I so appreciate as well the humour that is always part of the opening. Thank You 10% Community!,I love this app. It is so easy to use, full of incredible teachers and meditations. I enjoy the challenges periodically throughout the year and the courses available too. I have been listening to the talks more recently and they have been especially helpful during these challenging times. So many resources and such great information and support for building your meditation practice.,10% Happier app has enabled me to start and maintain a daily meditation habit for almost 2 years: I know because I track the days using this app. I started with the programs and talks, and now use the unguided timer. The sleep meditations have been very helpful on nights when I can’t settle down. I’ve also had questions answered using the help tab. Well worth the money! Highly recommended.,I haven’t meditated in years, and happened to read Dan’s book on someone else’s recommendation. That lead to a renewed interest in the power of meditation for its own sake.\\n\\nThe app is extremely user-friendly, has an easy-to-follow flow, and has quickly become one of my favorite meditation tools.\\n\\nI encourage you to give the free one-week trial a shot - it may just change your life!,I’ve been able to access the app a few times in the 4 days that I’ve had it, but the majority of the time, it says “network connection lost, please try again”. I’ve deleted and re-installed the app several times and it keeps happening. I’m able to use my other apps so I know it’s not my network connection. I’ve sent several emails to their support and have gotten no response- to be fair it’s been less than 24 hours, but still! $100 for an app, and I usually balk at paying anything! I paid in full and cannot get a refund. I so wanted to be able to use this app:-(,I have been a member for over a year. It helps me every night to calm down before sleeping plus the knowledge I get about managing my thoughts is amazing. \\n    I loved the courses and the fact that always there are new sessions added. That was extremely helpful during the pandemic.\\n    Thank you to everyone who contributes to the ten percent app creation. It is so intelligent and inspiring.,When I read 10% Happier years ago, it really connected for me. I’ve always been interested in meditation but could never really do it. The book opened my eyes, and I tried. But this app has really taken it to a whole new level. All the teachers are kind and full of wisdom. Ive invited friends to the New Years challenge, and they loved it. They are now yearly subscribers, as am I. Hghly recommended.,They do a great job of making meditation accessible, understandable, and most importantly manageable. \\n\\nIt doesn’t feel like a chore. It doesn’t feel like a “method”. It feels natural. It feels welcoming. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this app. Use it once, you’ll come back the next day. And the next day. And the next day. 5 - 10 mins a day, and the lessons you’ll learn are applicable everywhere.,Started up with this app and meditation again after my husband and father died within a week of each other last year. It’s helped me cope with the grief and anger and despair. The teachers are my online sangha, and though I may never meet or speak with any of them, they have my gratitude for helping me come to terms with my life as it is now. Thank you to them.,It\\'s an excellent app with new content coming out weekly. One thing, I would like to see is that the timer is made longer like up 23 hrs, instead of just going up to 90 mins of unguided mediation. Other than that, it’s an excellent app. Been using for about a week now & will continue to use. Will update after Timer is made longer.,I’ve been trying to learn proper meditation for several years but kept feeling like I was doing it wrong and would quit. This app has taught me that this is all part of the process - not the quitting part mind you.  \\n\\nI am happy I chose to do the 21 Day New Year’s Challenge. The brief introduction and interviews helped me better understand the next step.,I started this meditation practice/challenge thanks to my best friend. The timing could no have been better as the world keeps spinning into these very unhappy places. These mediations are helpful way beyond words on any good day but particularly helpful in making me a stronger, happier soul in the face of current events that have been rattling the world. I am extremely grateful for these daily gifts. Thank you 10 percent!!!,The free trial only allows you to go through the course with little intros by the grating Host the founder. You can’t try any other meditations. I appreciate that everybody has different tastes, but to sign up for the trial, you can only sign up for the yearly, $100 subscription. I signed up late at night and couldn’t get through the whole intro course before, in the early morning of the seventh day, I got charged the $100. Despite cancelling that day, I’m out the whole $100 and an annoying app that’s much more rigid than Simple Habit or Headspace.,I’ve tried several different meditations app but I love 10%. I love the search feature and the wide range of topics. I love the short videos packed with gems and the practices that follow. One recommendation and a feature I’ve enjoyed is the ability to Invite a Friend (ie New Years Challenge). It’s fun to see your friends progress while doing the same challenge together. Could this feature be added to other courses?,I don’t know how I would have made it through the Pandemic without 10%, and I don’t want to know. I have made meditation part of my life and my recovery. Because I have a quantitative look at how many times I meditated during the week, when I have a “bad” week, it is invariably coincides with a week when I ‘couldn’t find the time to meditate.\\n\\nDonnademnurse,Great content and app but videos did not fit latest iPhone models X and later. Also I can see a line like artifact near rounded corners of the video top and bottom right corners. I think it should be fixed. I wanted to take screenshot but artifact didn\\'t appeared on screen shot I can only see this line artifact during video playback before meditation.,While I wasn’t necessarily a meditation “skeptic”, I was, at the minimum, not yet able to find a consistent and beneficial practice. This app is incredibly accessible and down to earth, no matter your level of familiarity with meditation, and even if you use it and stop, use it again and stop, it’s benefits will go with you. Please, give it a try!,I am new to practicing meditation, and I thought it would be just a way to calm my mind when needed. Instead this app is giving me access to some very useful life advice that I can apply in my world. It’s a well-rounded approach that lets me tailor my practice for me, and at the same time open my eyes to a new way of looking at everyday life.,Thank you Ten Percent for helping me and my partner Jozene manage our early childhood trauma. I cannot thank 10% enough for bringing us closer to our Creator, each other and others.  Since my recovery from drugs & alcohol, I have always defined success as having the 3 R’s in life: Relationship, Relationship & Relationship(with self, others and our Creator) Thank you Ten Percent for your support in recovery from our trauma inflicted lives!,I have had panic attack and anxiety since I was a teenager and still do. I have been meditating on and off for yrs. when under stress and anxiety, it’s almost impossible for me to concentrate on meditation. So I will continue for the 7 days and see how it goes. I’m sure I will have high anxiety during these 7 days, so we will see if these meditations and advice is different than what I e tried before.,I was hesitant to start the New Years Challenge with Ten Percent. Each consecutive night after meditating, I was so looking forward to hear what new tool I was about to learn and put into practice\\nJust learning how to deal with the mindless constant thoughts that entire your quiet space at the end of your day has been life changing \\nThank you Ten Percent and Dan Harris,This app is great! I’ve been a big fan of Dan Harris’s books and the podcast so I had high hopes for this app.. and I am honestly  still impressed with howWell put together it is and the quality, variety, and accessibility ofIt’s content is really wonderful. Definitely AT LEAST 10% Happier than I otherwise would have been..,I have enjoyed listening to 10%happier podcast and the guided meditations . It’s like my morning cup of relaxation and wisdom. When I’m ruminating in my negative stories, just listening to one of the many wise, experienced meditator’s words and guidance helps me shift my thinking for the better. I feel so grateful for Dan Harris and his crew and discovering this gem! Thank you! ❤️,Ten Percent Happier has helped me start and keep up a consistent meditation practice that prior to this had been a “fits and starts” kind of thing. The low-key approach of Dan and the other teachers creates an atmosphere of “you can do this” and, even with my perfectionist tendencies, has shown me how to slow down and take my practice (and life) one breath at a time.,I didn’t know self compassion was a “thing”. As it turns out it’s the only thing that reels in my nonproductive judgey thought patterns. That combined with the gentle approach to learning how to sit still and though a quiet mind is what we are after, we are successful every time we notice we have gotten lost in thought. And that equates to a lot of success! :-),It is always excellent to see all the special teachers each one of them with their personal touch... Really it was very special to connect with the whole group during the Pandemia and the enxiety derived from it. A wonderful group of people you could see them everyday of the week.I felt I was not alone.... god bless you all,I have purchased a lot of apps.  They are generally fun at first but then the shine wears off and soon they end up in the delete pile.  This one is different.  I have learned so much.  And whether it is just that voice that guides me to sleep at night or an introspective look at what is going on inside.  This app really has helped me to get to that happier place.,I’ve meditated and practiced yoga for 2 decades but am so grateful to add this new resource to my library. I appreciate the humor, the practical language, the respect and reverence for the ancient sources from which we draw our practice., the wise voices from so many contemporary experts. All the feels and gratitude for the care and work put into this app and into the podcast.,I am a busy professional with 2 small kidos at home.  Always thirsty for a break, fresh air, flit to surface :). This app allows me to do that, anytime, anywhere and on my schedule.  It also has about 5 minutes of science driven content, and 10 minute meditation.  Wonderfully condensed material and practice .  Just what I need on a daily basis to maintain my sanity :),I’ve used the other apps but they pale in comparison. From taking a walk through the basics of meditations to deeply meaningful courses, daily topics, or the plethora of choices for your varying nighttime needs. \\nThere is also the ability to reach out to actual coaches for advice. \\nThis is an application that truly meets you were you are.,The material presented is practical and easy to apply to my everyday life.  I appreciate that the app does not have an ‘incense and meditation cushion’ atmosphere.  The speakers don’t use that voice I’ve heard on other guided meditation apps, you know, that voice that sounds like their in a room where someone is terminally ill.  \\nI listen and meditate anywhere and anytime.\\nSustainable.,I didn’t realize what a rut I had gotten into with my meditation practice until I explored 10% Happier. In just my first week here, I’ve already been very pleased with the variety of themes and guides. I’m already feeling much more connected and calm. This is the perfect way to enter into this new year with a refreshed, positive attitude.,With an array of very accomplished coaches; very well designed guided mindfulness sessions that are filled with immense wisdom, playfulness, humor, kindness; a beautiful and smooth interface- this app can be a very good guide for anyone who wants to just try or go deep with mindfulness. I highly recommend this app. As I have learned today, “May you be well”. This app can get you there.,This app teaches you so many different meditation techniques and exposes you to soo many different teachers with different styles.  You have a choice of topics to examine as well.  It’s not the usual melodic voice, chime tones and empty your mind stuff.  You work with your busy mind in these meditations, it’s a part of the practice.  It’s changing my life for the better!,This is by far most comprehensive, user friendly, strait to the point mediation guide online. I have tried several other meditation apps and while I have found some other ones, they still don’t compare. After months of mostly continuous use, I really am 10% happier. :),Dan Harris smooths the difficulties of the outside world through meditation. Rather than continue with the regularly scheduled program of the new year challenge, he immediately pivoted the meditation for today to address what happened at Congress. This meditation is exactly what I needed this morning to prepare for what’s next. Thank you Dan Harris and team for your brilliance. Namaste,This app has been a wonderful way to begin the meditation habit.  Such great teachers and I enjoy how guide on this journey. Definitely have benefited and I recommend this to others.  It’s a gift you give yourself and those you love because you become a better, kinder and more intentional person. 👍🏻👍🏻,Providing a platform to teachings and meditation as accessible as an app, of this quality, with these teachers? I am so grateful I have tears. This is impactful for my life, my relationship with myself and others. The “ten percenters” are putting out some crazy goodness with this and I am so grateful!!!!,I’ve had this app for a year now and it’s really good at first. But I feel they are running out of new content after a while. I meditate every day and I’m now going over meditations I’ve already used before. I’d also like meditations geared for certain issues like depression. I’m not sure it’s worth the price anymore.,If you like to understand the “whys and hows” to meditation this is a great app!! There are have varied teachers with many different approaches and this is why I have stuck with this app!!\\n\\nDan is a great interviewer and with a more basic somewhat “down to earth” approach it helps you notice that your mind and issues are similar to everyone else.,I joined 10 Percent 1 year ago. It has been my companion through this Pandemic and will continue to be so going forward. Whether I listen in the morning to start the day or last thing at night to help me sleep, there are so many elements to it, I’m never bored. I always find something of value.,I am an educator who has always felt stress, but now the pandemic stress overwhelms me.  I have completed a MBSR course, so I am not new to meditating.  This app helps support my practice by providing me with courses, challenges and daily tracking.  I also enjoy the discussions with meditation teachers.  They provide insight and provoke thoughtful consideration on my part.  Thank you!!!,Last year they offered their material free to healthcare persons. At the time the world was stressful and I started trying it out. What I have found is extremely helpful and great material to help me through the pandemic, elections and life in general. I have recommended to friends and family and will continue to do so.,I absolutely love and am so happy I signed up for this New Years challenge. I am learning so much more about meditation then I already knew! Dan and the other teachers are so genuine and explain the art of meditating In a straightforward and “ real” human way. It’s changing my life and helping me to cope with all the chaos in the world!\\nTHANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!,Dan Harris and team: Thank you for your wisdom, humility, humor, and encouragement. Your app, book(s), audiobook(s)…I’ve been voraciously consuming it all during the past few weeks of profound professional and personal life change. You’ve helped more than these words can adequately convey. 🙏,This app is so incredible. It makes it so easy to take 10-15 minutes out of my day just for myself. I feel so much better after I\\'ve listened to the speakers and taken the time to meditate, cultivate awareness, etc. I\\'m happy to have the help of this app to build my meditation practice.,I have wanted to begin a continuous process of meditations, but I have never been able to do this until I started 10% happier. It provided just the right amount of time and variety of message and great technique to keep me focused and continue this journey.,I am thoroughly enjoying the meditation challenge and finding it so helpful during these challenging times. I am already trying to explore how to keep this going with videos and meditations from the people who are part of this. Thank you, Dan for putting this together.,Meditation has helped me calm the tapes running in my head which are mostly negative. I never understood how to meditate…now I get it. Thank you and I am proselytizing about mediation and sending the app to friends. Most are not interested but when they are…wow! There’s an interconnected web out there.,10% Happier has become an important part of my life and I could not thrive in these difficult times without the daily prompts in the meditations and talks. The variety and quality of the teachers make this program the best on the planet. Dan thank you so much!,I love the different meditation teachers and topics they discuss and points they make. I’ve had this app for more than a year now and that’s how long I’ve been meditating consistently. It has helped even my life out so I’m more even keeled throughout the day. Thank you Dan and teachers. 😊❤️🤘🏼,The courses are bite sized, yet really meaningful and full of simple approaches that can be integrated into our daily existence quite easily and quickly. Highly recommended for simple strategies to manage daily and/or frequent stressors!,I love the various options and lengths. I think the interview aspect is easy to listen to as a beginner.\\nGreat variety of different teachers and insights. I am finally at a point where I’m excited to do more and find longer sessions to see where I can go with it.,Yes, still at it and this year I have a goal of meditating each day if only for one minute. I have completed each day of 2021 so far. \\n\\nThe benefit is that I have found other meditation guides helping me with my main issue of over eating. Maybe at 10% you are aware of Jon Gabriel. His 21-day meditations are helping me with weight management. I gave up using 10% recommendation as it was too academic...Gabriel is more in line with my needs.\\n\\nStill love 10%, especially my favorites, JosephG, OrenJS, SebeneS and, recently, AlexisS. Now if you could add Jon Gabriel that would be perfect!\\n\\nThanks so much. Onward...,Finding this app and listening to Dan and his friends has been the anchor I have been seeking. Learning to meditate has been a goal of mine and this app is helping me get there! I feel like Dan and all the wonderful teachers are my friends taking me on this journey. Thank you all so much!\\n\\nMaryanne,I appreciate many aspects of the app.  For today, having just followed Dan leading the meditation for the challenge, i value is everyday vocabulary for describing and guiding meditation.  Well, one other note: there are so many resources in the app.  I love learning and I can do that here.  Happy New Year! and thank YOU!,I had first listened to the Ten Percent Happier podcast then decided to try out the app. It has been amazing! It has kept me grounded and peaceful even when I have intense anxiety. I enjoy all of the meditations and will continue to use this app for a long time. Thanks again!,I downloaded this app at the beginning of the pandemic and have been using it since. Dan provides expert guidance on how to start the practice of mindfulness meditation. The teachers and classes are the best. The practice has helped me find perspective and peace in very challenging times.,Thus is something I want to add to my life.  I can see it might be possible but I disappoint myself time and time again by not following through each day.  I feel pathetic.. why don’t I make it a priority?  Especially since the end result is what I’m looking for?  I know- I know- start again.  So I’m starting again,I am a nurse practitioner and I have recommended the app to dozens of my patients, many of whom thanked me down the road. I love the variety of speakers and topics, as well as the choices and various lengths of guided meditations. There are lots of meditation apps but Dan Harris is my “go to” guy for the last 2 years or more.,There are a variety of courses for varying purposes including many different meditation techniques/schools. The teachers are knowledgeable, kind, and insightful. Dan Harris is always skeptical, but a good sport.\\n\\nI only wish there were options to choose the length of any given meditation, but maybe I just haven’t figured that aspect out yet.,The lessons are very informative and help with understanding. The meditations keep me returning for the practice. Whenever the 21 day challenges come up it is a good time to focus on the discipline and invite friends to try meditating. I haven’t used the coaches but intend to do so this year. Yes, a multi year subscriber.,I love this app, meditate every day. Sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes longer. Always take advantage of the Challenges.\\nAlways more to learn, always a great reason to practice. The number of excellent teachers is astounding.\\nWell done Dan Harris and company\\nSara in Paris,This is by far the most accessible and meaningful meditation app available- I’ve tried a few and this one has something for everyone - it can help create a mindfulness habit that helps navigate life’s inevitable challenges! LOVE!,I haven’t tried many other Apps for Meditation because when I found this one I stopped looking. I’ve been using it for about two years and enjoy the content and the design of the App. \\n\\nThese guys have done it right!,I just stumbled across this and I’m so glad I did!  I think the teachers are spot on and very talented. Dan Harris is the glue and perfect as the moderator.  I have learned a great deal from these teachers. I am truly 10% (or much more) happier.  A big thanks to everyone who put this together.,10% Happier meditations have helped me to go from a 10 in Anxiety to learning how to control it - at least a 2.  I’m really working on learning how to accept myself - like myself. Meditation has given me a better perspective on how to manage my emotions and stress.,The theme song is trite, annoying, derivative, too fast, too loud, and takes away from all that is good about the app.  \\n\\nDan needs to take voice lessons from Oren Jay Sofer and Joseph Goldstein.  He uses the same voice to lead a meditation as he does to interview someone.  He needs to use his inside voice instead.,I rate it this because it helps me fall asleep and calm down. it’s good  to use for when you are having mixed emotions and a hard time. I have 4 stars because there needs to be ones for kids or younger ones. I am fine if there isn’t but it would be nice. This is why I rate it 4/5 stars,I love this app. Before I got it I was super anxious and I didn’t know how to deal with it. But the people that talk to you help you understand why you feel anxious and what anxiety is. I noticed a big change with my attitude after I downloaded it.,Been trying to meditate regularly. Recommended by a colleague. The gamification of the app works for me. And once I paid, I was invested. Solid content, easy to fit in before family gets up or while kids are chill. A great product!,The single best thing I did for my health during the pandemic was this app. I am a front line health worker and the app was donated to us for a year for which I am forever grateful. I wouldn’t have gone beyond the paywall and the teaching and encouragement I got from it was invaluable.,It would be nice if the meditation I marked with hearts could be organized or if I could put a description what it is to me at time of saving. I try to go back to favorites but I am not sure why so saved them. Also it would allow for quick search because they could be indexed. “great for anxiety or fear. “\\nIt appears that listening to talks counts toward meditation time in the minutes but maybe it shouldn’t. \\nIt would be nice to have new courses. I have finished all the courses.\\nOverall, the app does do an ok job. It is better than most.\\nThank you for asking for my input.\\nMay you find peace in my words,I love this app. When I get complacent, TPH offers something new and relevant to keep me practicing. This app has helped me stay sane through the COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, economic insecurity, political upheaval, and most recently the events that occurred in our Capitol on January 6. Thank you Dan Harris and team!,That catch phrase is what drew me to read Dan’s book and use his meditation app. Never before have I been able to sit and meditate without getting frustrated with myself until this platform came into my life. Happier and calmer for sure.,I\\'m trying the anxiety challenge right now after being reluctant about the meditation challenges but it\\'s actually been so nice. I\\'ve done two days so far and the meditations by Booker make me feel so... held. Thank you so much.,Meditation for me has always been a bit of a struggle, visualizing me on mountain top or in a field; these never worked well for me. This meditation program follows a more psychological / intellectual approach that taps into soul, body, and spiritual connection.  Highly recommend.,I’am very enjoying this app, because it quide you with all the situation you confront in meditation, and its easy to reconect with you body and breath. This practice is new for me, after taking two seminars of Mindfullness & Selfcompassion. Iam starting to practice, and this app is helping me.,I love the app and use it regularly.  One small feature request for the watch app:  could the timer mode please be extended to allow times over an hour?  Thanks!,I, too, appreciated the generous free trial for being a first responder. I did not use it as much as I would have liked but see the benefit, and therefore, as the subscription comes up for renewal, will gladly renew. Thanks for supporting us!,If you’re goal is to help people why are you charging such an obscene amount of money. I get you have to make your money, but a hundred dollars man ? If I have an extra hundred dollars I’m going to the dentist, or putting in in my emergency fund. I’m 21 and should be able to access this program without putting up a good amount of my rent.,Life-changing!  And that’s only the FREE content/challenges I can afford to do! (Saving up for membership...) You can learn and grow from all sorts of teachers and wise folks on here.  My most positively impactful app.,I always thought I was not good at meditating but ten percent has given me an easy way to learn. The 21 day challenge has helped me immensely and I look forward everyday to this special ME time. Thank you,I’m someone who loves daydreaming, reflecting, and letting my mind wander. I think this is why I am prone to anxiety. It’s sort of the double edged sword, if you will. \\n\\nMeditation has, for several years now, been a practice I have hoped to engage with regularly because I think it will help make the daydreaming more productive and less anxiety inducing. \\n\\nI’ve enjoyed listening to Dan’s podcast and finally decided a little extra guidance might help. Day one of the New Year’s Meditation is done and I’m delighted.\\n\\nThank you Dan!,Can’t live without Dan, his posse, the 10% happier app and the podcast. They’ve come to be an integral part of my journey to be a better human. Dan is an outstanding interviewer, his team is A+ and I’ve grown in so many ways as a result of this resource.

I’ve come to look forward to the voices of these marvelous teachers. The challenges are a great way to introduce your friends to meditation.,I love the 10% Happier podcast and this app!\\nI use the free version as I prefer doing silent meditations. I love the challenges, the structure and instructions are supportive and I use them as an opportunity to get back on track.,ALL the discussion we can have on taking shame away from anxiety and helping to “tame” it changes peoples lives. Thank you for this important work. Thank you for talking about it. Thank you for normalizing it.,Try it. I’ve used 10% happier for three years. It got me through a very rough time in my life. Over time, it has helped me find ease and taught me how to respond instead of react to life’s stresses. The teachers are all great.,I read Dan’s book a while ago and this is the perfect next actionable step. You can easily learn more, choose your meditations and pick the length. It is a treat for yourself and I am grateful this app is out in the world.,Ten Percent Happier is such an informative gift to help one thrive in modern times. Can’t express how much this app has helped me get in touch with inner awareness and development of ability to let go of unhelpful thought patterns. Thank you !,My life could be better with a few minutes a day? \\n\\nI understood meditation’s benefits for 25 years, a simple app helped me achieve the practice \\n\\n10 minutes a day. We are all worth it.,I am very sensitive to detail and tend to isolate at a very rapid anxiety, so am particular about the different practitioners. Once I started favoriting the ones I liked I started to get much more from the app.,The trainers really resonated with me, and I was pretty surprised the competitors made it so hard to simply meditate. Very much enjoy the frequent updates, especially ones during major events. Keep it up!!!,Offer myself a safe place to be in, experience the emotions and talk myself through them with kindness.  This lesson 7 brought tears to my eyes.

With your help, I’m enjoying my sessions since you explain everything so well! I’m a believer! \\nThank you,Ten Percent is great because it helps me overcome my religious and scientific skepticism. \\n\\nScience: I always figured this stuff was just a waste of time. I was wrong. 10% does a great job explaining its value & offering varied options based on your personal needs.\\n\\nReligion: I grew up in a traditional Christian denomination, so I was NOT interested in finding a path to Buddhism. 10% is great at being secular, using best practices from all kinds of sources.\\n\\nGood luck with your practice :-),The last design update is a let down. \\nI have been using this app for awhile and the content provided is absolutely outstanding. \\n\\nSadly, the new lay out for the singles section absolutely mind numbing and does not work at all. \\nI actually thought I was in the wrong part of the app. It went from cool and playful art icons to gray boxes with waves and plain text. Not very inviting. \\nWhy was that section changed and rest were left pretty much the same?\\n\\nI would love to see (and there maybe a way I haven’t found) to get singles downloaded to the Apple Watch.,TPH is a meditation app that has a wide variety of guided meditations to cover every need.

Ten Percent Happier has been the catalyst to rediscover joy and peace during such a tough time.  Best thing about 2021 already hands down.,The flexible sessions are great for walks, commuting, etc. The app interface is solid and well designed. One can search for sessions to fit a situation—stress, anger, grief, sleep, anxiety. I was skeptical, but it’s the best app that I’ve purchased.,I am really enjoying the 21 day challenge. It is a reasonable way to add mindfulness meditation into your everyday life. Each day doing this strengthens my ability to be mindful.

I feel even just after doing Day 1, this is something I can do with this approach.,They don’t tell you it costs $100 until after you’ve told them all about yourself and given them your email. Then there is no easy way to delete your account — you need to email them. They have a “free trial” which is unclear because it’s free for one week and then charges $100 and not much warning. The experience was disingenuous,I am in awe each time I meditate that I can sit still for 10 minutes. The singles keep you engaged almost like its the voice inside your head. No “monkey-mind”.,My mind was racing all day today. The reminder popped up on my phone and I eagerly opened the app and started “Behind the Waterfall.” Thank you for the 5 minute respite from my racing mind.,I love the variety of teAchers, the skepticism with which they approach each concept, the useful courses and the challenges. Using the app daily has had a huge positive affect on my life. Dare I say I’m eve 20% happier?,This meditation app is wonderful. It is aimed at average people with busy lives.

Your format & speakers are on point.,I’m trying out the 15 day New Year Challenge right now. It’s going ok, I’m not new to meditation. The concepts in this app are great, but the teachers have a sharpness in their tones that make the sessions feel more like lectures than relaxing meditation. I prefer the relaxing tones of Calm, Headspace, and Breethe apps much better.,This app has really changed my life. I don’t say that lightly, but learning to be more mindful has been a game changer for me. I use this app everyday and it is firmly in my daily routine.,What a wonderful thing you have done for me.

I am so very grateful and highly recommend this app for others,This so has saved me and I will turn to it again after the death of my father. \\nI find if I stray, I miss it.\\nI am so grateful to 10% Happier.,I downloaded this app a year ago and forgot to use it. I paid for a year sub thinking I’d get around to it. I never did get around to using the app until today when I was charged $100 for renewal ($99). I finally figured out how to unsubscribe. Prolly not gonna get my money back. Great!,When I finally have a chance to clear my mind, relax and focus on mindfulness around day’s end, up comes today’s meditation strictly for first thing in the morning...”Good Morning...let’s do this before you start your day!” Not useful and I cancel the session.

From meditation variety to education to self acceptance, this is a wonderful app.,I love ten percent and their treatment of customers is appalling. I just received an email billing me for another year without warning. How do you stop that?  If you go to account management under help, it is literally empty. Is there a place to log in?

No. Buyer beware!!,I just signed up for the 2021 New Year challenge and I really like the format and variety of the guided meditations.,This App has changed my life!

When I feel my practice lagging I turn to this app. Thanks Dan\\'s and team!,After using app for a year, new year started with 21 days challenge, pretty good for 1st 3 days and guess what, day 4, we are being assailed by politics.

His podcast is teaching me so much by bringing all of these amazing people into my life!

My girlfriend talked me into really looking into it, but I have to say. I am super impressed with the beginning!,Thank you for the free year in honor of mental health awareness. As a psychotherapist, the app content and the podcast are my self-care.,I logged into day 4 of a meditation challenge after a good first 3 days. The host began talking about world events and politics and admitted he is also a journalist. \\n\\n I stopped it and proceeded to write this review and will delete the app. People use these apps, sports, video games and exercise to escape the outside world. Not be lectured about it. \\n\\nThis should the LAST place on earth I ever hear about news or politics. \\n\\nI wanted to explore meditation to become better at concentrating and blocking out the world. \\n\\nBig misstep here.,This meditation app is my go-to for quieting an agitated mind. I am now taking the anti-anxiety challenge. Excellent mindful practices for facing the dragon of our anxieties. OM,This app & the 10% podcast are my constant companions.  I’m so grateful for them.,Enjoying 1st week greatly so far, thank you Dan & Joseph for your thorough, thoughtful river guidance and holistic program format.,I’d been delaying this for some time. I’m so glad that I started.,Kinda frustrating - I wanted to do the 21 day new year challenge and it forced me to sign up for annual membership in order to start challenge. Will have to miss rest of challenge by cancelling membership in 6 days.,discriminates against older people..asked if I had kids, but no category for grown children and grandchildren\\nwhom  are a part major  part of life esp as age increases. Age is a stressor every bit as much as kids, jobs, etc..\\nI assume there is no one with full life experience,Refreshing and insightful l find the meditations to be just what I need to reset my psyche. Easy and relatable,Guided meditations are my favorite activity in therapy. This app provides that, and it’s just so, so, so, cleverly and artfully designed. Grateful!,Dan Harris does an amazing job with his learnings and Leslie booker has key insights!,Great basic meditation training for beginners and a really great tool for an ongoing practice. Highly recommended!!,10 minutes a day.  Life changing...Try it.,I strongly recommend 10% Happier. It is relatable, usable, and realistic. Be happy - walk toward the embrace,Changed my life.,It looks so good, you’re ready to go. You give them your email to get started and then BOOM! How would you like to pay for the 99/year subscription? The app is useless without paying.,Dan\\n\\nI have enjoyed your Broadcasting Career for many years. Your ability to deliver the news with a calm, steady demeanor provides comfort and confidence. \\n\\nSo, it’s no surprise that 10% Happier is the same trusted advisor, mentor and guide. \\nI am truly grateful for your Movement of Happiness. \\n\\nThank you\\n\\nJim,I really wanted to enjoy the new year’s challenge but it’s impossible to meditate when the narrator keeps commenting every 30 seconds.,I pay for this service to help clear my mind for the day. Not to feel like I’m watching the news.,I signed up so I could get away from politics.   I’m was not receptive to it being brought into my meditation.   Is there not anyplace you can get away & relax without having to be brought back into it!!!,Easy to use, wonderful varied meditation leaders,The audio kept cutting out but i liked the content,Great app for relaxation, sleep preparation and meditation- wide variety of choice.,Helps to keep me on track 😊,Love this app. The guided meditations by Sharon Salzburg, Joseph Goldstein, Sebene Sellassie, and others are absolutely perfect.,Always giviing helpful advice along with the meditation.,Thank you. Wonderful. Timely; to me.,Like the various formats of practices that keep me motivated,Always good guests to help me in my practice.,Apple please remove from App Store. \\n\\niPadOS requires landscape support. This is not terribly difficult. \\n\\niPad landscape is missing for this app. \\n\\nMost of the 500 million iPads are used in landscape mode. \\n\\nEspecially for videos and content. \\n\\nAlso because cases for iPads tend to work on your lap or table in landscape mode.\\n\\nCan someone please fix this?,Amazing app, very effective, well put together. Great job Dan Harris.,Why everyone feels the need to bring current us politics into everything is a recipe for more stress not less,Use as directed.,Insightful self-paced guided meditations.  Enjoyable and helpful.,Romina,Not feeling connected to booker - very distracted /great theoretical concepts but no emotional connection. Feels like a chore. \\nComplete opposite with Joseph Goldstein,If you like your meditation with a good mix of left wing political views this is for you. Was a super product now tainted with Dan’s political views. Sad to say I was a fan and now not.,Thoughtful, accessible, and doable. Great hosts.,Been doing it for over month and it just keeps getting sappier and sappier... really regretting spending the money on this...,Great meditation teachers and Dan Harris organized a great app,I love the simplicity and gentleness of this style of guided mediation!,The teachers are amazing.  The subjects relevant.  The effect calming and balancing,this challenge has given me hope, thank you, more please 😜,This is a marvelous companion on your journey.,I am turned off by the preludes to meditation that have a political bent.,I was initially weary of meditation because of how it had been presented to me before. It seemed like something reserved for New Age practitioners (no hate to them at all) or tied to certain religions (again, no hate).  10% Happier, however, focuses on guided meditation practices removed from any religious or spiritual framework. It focuses on the moment and helping you to be kind to yourself and your inner thought life. \\n\\nIt’s broken up into different courses based on different needs. Some of the courses help you with stress, or forming batter habits, or having more patience, etc. Each session within each course gives a video rundown of the concepts of that day’s mediation in the style of an interview between Dan Harris and the meditation professional who will then guide you in the actual practice. You are not locked in to these course once you start; you can mix and match as you go. There is even an entire section devoted to meditations designed to help you fall asleep!\\n\\nI should note, however, that the free version only allows you into the basics course. While helpful, it is limited to teaching you the basics of meditation. The premium version can be purchased on a monthly or yearly basis and I highly recommend it. \\n\\nThe interface is very clean and if you ever have questions, you can email a meditation professional from within the app and they will get back to you promptly with as much help as they can offer. \\n\\nFor anyone looking for a wonderful, guided meditative practice, this is definitely worth a try. This isn’t some hokey space religion or some impractical, out of body experiment. This is a down to earth experience to help you learn more about yourself.,OMG!!  😊 This is by far the most informative, comprehensive, insightful, knowledgeable and helpful experience with meditation I have ever had!  I\\'ve tried many different apps and this one is my favorite and the most helpful hands down! \\nAccess to a variety of different teachers and access to so many valuable meditations on a wide variety of topics!  The walking meditations are some of my favorites.\\nI\\'m 65+, disabled and blessed to be a survivor of extreme narcissistic, emotional, physical and mental abuse most of my life.  I\\'ve used meditation and breathing exercises for many years to bring myself off the ledge more times than I can count!  Pills just don\\'t do it.... This app has transformed my meditation practice to a level that I never imagined!  It\\'s so empowering to bring myself back from panic without a pill. \\nNow meditation comes very easily and deeply to me whenever I need to come back to my center, my heart and soul. It\\'s as natural and easy as activities of daily life.  It can be tapped into at any time!  The benefits are lifesaving!  This gift of taking away the \\nfeeling of \"rules\" for proper, healing  effective meditation are non existent .  There aren\\'t rules just a commitment to practice a few minutes everyday or a few days a week.  Whatever you feel is best for you in this moment.  The \"swinging from the chandelier\" anxiety and panic I used to live with every day have become a thing that I can control or for sure greatly decrease the intensity of. \\nMy need for prescription medicine to control my anxiety has decreased markedly.  My blood pressure is improving so much that my cardiologist has lowered the dose and # of doses per day! \\nI feel a underlying sense of peace and calm that I can\\'t explain!  It\\'s like being 5 again and having nothing to think about but playing,  naps and TODAYS FUN! I find joy in the smallest of things!  Fixing a snack, walking in my neighborhood, MUSIC !  This app and instructors way of simplifying meditation language has changed me!\\nI meditate several times a day sometimes, it\\'s like eating or getting dressed, it\\'s part of my daily routine and if I miss a day it\\'s okay, no rules!  Just a wonderful tool in my little box of tools that I can access when I need to.\\nI do believe that it\\'s important to try to practice at least ~10 minutes 4-6 times a week for it to become a routine for you. You can use this tool anytime anywhere!  Once you learn how quickly you can get to that place of quiet inner peace then you just tap into that and go there for as long as you want or feel you need to.\\nHow can I ever thank you enough! \\nI would give you 10⭐️ if I could!\\nWe need to be teaching these simple, effective self compassion & self care to our children as part of their education! \\nMay we all find calm & gratitude for our blessings.\\nThank You to the 10% team! Outstanding email support for any questions.\\nNo regrets!  Best meditation app out there!,I’ve literally listened to Dan since this podcast began. I benefited greatly with both instruction and learning and defining vocabulary and the history of meditation as well as aspects of Buddhism the theory and religion fir some guests. Learning about the science from Ivy League ( Stanford counts too ;) adds the epiracle foundation my brain needs. I joined the app for free and let it go after two weeks but I let it go. \\n\\nThen, finally, at the peak of frustration with the pandemic, how poorly I was managing stress, work, politics,  I joined in a 21 day challenge. I got to meet previous guests and their BIG brains like Kristen, Sam, Angela, Alexis and Lauri Santos was even my accountability friend! I just wanted more folks on “my team”, so I joined. I COMPLETED my 21 day challenge ( I had never meditated so consistently before)  and I completed the 6 part Habits mediation course. I am more aware & I am not alone. HUGE Insights a formed that help me manage. \\n\\nI enjoy the gentle reminder that comes to my phone. The CHECK mark I see when I complete a session and the tracker that keeps reinforcing my habit and holds myself accountable. I need this right now. \\n\\nIn the app, Dan and crew give the facts before the meditation . This was was built for me! I start my coffee and listen to Dan give me the backstory and content. Then, while my coffee brews, I sit. \\n\\nI truly have been reformatted. Covid is still here. Uncertainty is still here. How I choose to manage all of it- has changed. I can’t explain it, but right now, I NEED meditation to keep the wheels on the track, moving not too fast, not too slow but just right. In the event the wheels stop... we begin again. \\n\\nThanks 10 percent crew. Keep up your innovation and linking the “typical” American to an evidence based method that at the end of the day, literally makes this world a better place to be in. No small feat.,I’m a longtime fan of ten percent happier and for the past month an avid daily TPH live listener. I can honestly say it’s the highlight of my day availing my self of the wisdom ,humor,  and connection that Dan Harris brings to his community of followers.\\nI don’t “know” who else is listening and yet we have become a sangha of sorts- a group of people who has committed to making meditation a part of how we live during this unprecedented time.  I had trouble sleeping this morning so at 5:45am I listened to Dan and Jeff Warren and somehow the worry about not getting more than 6 hours of sleep is behind me and I’m more present in my body. And prepared to meet the day. You talked about humor and I related well to  how humor helps me cope with stress. We buried my mother in law yesterday at a funeral that was anything but typical. Only  8 of us were allowed to gather (in masks and gloves six foot distanced) to say goodbye. We couldn’t hug the immediate mourners. We could not shovel dirt on the casket or have shiva all of which are powerful parts of  Jewish custom. And yet we laughed standing there commenting about our creative masks. We appreciated the undertaker who acknowledged our loss.  And hours later in a moment of hysteria driving home from New Jersey to MA I noticed I had a small piece of melted chocolate in my palm somehow it missed my mouth and smeared all over the steering wheel. And I remembered our “pandemic” first aid kit and used a highly sought after anti bacterial wipe for chocolate clean up ( after licking my palm) and we laughed aloud!\\n\\nPandemics require community support\\nThank you Dan Harris and TPH team for years of great work especially now!\\n\\nWith gratitude \\nGail,Meditations are all the same, lots of silence and no direction. Nothing meaningful.,The app works well on the iPhone, haven’t used it on my watch.  The content is great and prior to, and especially during, the pandemic lockdown I recommend this app for individuals that are skeptical about meditation and what it can do for them.  Each person that ended up trying the app or a basic breathing meditation told me that it actually helped them.  All of them were dealing with a large amount of stress and anxiety and losing sleep.\\n\\nWhile meditation isn’t a cure all and not a replacement for medical help, it is as equally important as physical activity in maintaining your health and managing stress.\\n\\nIf you’re on a personal journey to better understand yourself and make different decisions in how you perceive the world and interact with others - 10% happier has a treasure trove of content and teachings that can guide you on that journey.  It is presented in an approachable format and easily understandable.\\n\\nI’m going with 3 stars only because this app has been around for a long while now and there still isn’t a native iPad app.  Running an iPhone native app on an iPad is a horrific experience (to me).  I find myself using my phone less and my iPad more since I’ve been working at home for more than a year now.  The meditations don’t need the larger screen to be effective, I just find myself not picking up my phone as much and therefore not using the app as much.\\n\\nThanks for the app, thanks for the content, would you kindly consider adding an iPad app?,The sessions are OK but the downtime prompts are bad.,Good🙏🙏🙏🙏Tica,Flexible and sllcodlkidtibfb,Between this app and listening to the 10% Happier book twice on Audible (and it will remain in rotation), I can truly say that Dan et al have broken these concepts into relatable, bite-sized pieces to make it so much easier to assimilate into my life. To hear Dan give such insightful and, many times, hilarious accounts of his battle with the monkey mind has made it so much easier to begin identifying mine. While building the muscle to tame the a-hole in my head is truly a journey, I can say I am at least 10% better now than when I started...and trending in the right direction.,Just tell me you charge $99.95 a year before I fill out all of you questions. Thanks for the waste f my time.,A friend gave me a discount code for this app a while back snd I’ve been using it for over a year. I’ve tried mindfulness meditation before but never actually “got” what I was supposed to be doing. 10% Happier changed that. Now I get it, and I practice it, and I am slowly changing for the better. The content is informative, amusing, and down to earth instead of trying to sell spiritual enlightenment. The guidance hosts are varied and all high quality - I particularly like Jeff Warren, Alexis Santos, Sharon Salzberg (her focus guidance is favorited!), and Joseph Goldstein. \\n\\nI have exactly one complaint that cost the app a whole star: there is no search function!!!\\n\\nI have a second complaint that is really a suggestion - a breath trainer would be great. 4/6/8 breathing really works and I would love to see a section in the app for it. \\n\\nA second suggestion: put favorites on the Home Screen in the app! Or into an iOS widget. The widgets seem to have broken in the latest iOS but that is also true of many other apps (some by big name software companies.),I downloaded this app, believing I was getting a free trial period.  Today, I discovered I have been charged $99.99 for it.  I am very careful about trials of subscription apps, and I have no idea how this happened. There is no way I would knowingly pay $100 for an app I hadn’t even tried.  I haven’t gone through many reviews, but I see at least one other person this happened to this month.\\n\\nI have submitted a refund request to Apple; I suggest you pay very close attention to any transaction regarding this app.,Definitely not worth the money. You can find better meditation videos for free on YouTube.,I used to really love this app. The mediations are great. I love how they have very specific topics. However I mostly used it for sleep meditations. Was super excited they had a whole sleep section! I’ve actually done every single one in that section except a couple that are locked unless you pay. I was fine with that. Suddenly, I can’t do almost any of them (even though I’ve done them before) without paying. It tells me to subscribe for $99.99 a year. This made me pretty upset. I get that they have to make money and that there will be a version you have to pay for. And I’m sure that it probably would be worth it. But some people can’t afford that. For some people the lack of money is a stressor that pushes us towards mediation. And now that is being taken away. I understand that you can get free mediations on YouTube or something but I really enjoyed the structure of this app. In a time where people are out of work and struggling during the pandemic, I felt it in poor taste for them to take away most of their free content. While the product is good and I understand it’s fair for them to be paid, $100 a year just isn’t doable for some and to take away what was already free at a time like this seems a little tone deaf.,This review is not bot-made, I just am so much better thanks to this app. When I started skipping hygiene, personal health, social health, and only being on screens, I convinced myself to make a change. And the first step was using Sanvello. My anxiety is getting so much better, and I’ve completely engaged in social activities and started dabbling in minimalism for my sake of OCD.\\nNext, the committee section. I have made so many allies and good advice givers here. The report section is top-notch, and I can find people with fellow interests without being afraid of internet bullying, homophobic people, and etc. I seriously don’t deserve the kindness here. \\nLastly, the shorts. I personally enjoy Garden Mark, where he talks about plans, moving on, and other things while you see him tending to his plants. It keeps me focused but also calm! \\nThe only thing I dislike is I’m not able to pay 10$ a month for more lessons. Please either lower the price or stop premium! People with mental health issues should have less expensive options! \\nOverall, mostly fantastic app, and anyone, and I mean ANYONE, who has stress should get this app.,Sanvello (previously Pacifica) is the perfect app for improving mood, CBT, and anger management. I have used this app for nearly 6 years (since I was 12 or 13) and I have had a positive experience with it every year of use. \\n\\nThe best unique features of this app currently include: (in order of what I like most)\\n\\n•In-Depth Mood Tracking and feelings log\\n•Health Habit Tracking (Sleep, meals, exercise, etc.) and this even has the option to make custom bad habits like nail biting or smoking.\\n•Specified anonymous forums/group chats for peer-to-peer support with many different struggles \\n•Automatic weekly check ins (short quiz to determine levels of anxiety, depression, etc.)\\n•Small library of great meditations for various situations you might be facing. \\n\\n... and as usual, more premium features are available for a subscription. Even though subscriptions are available and recommend, I have used this app for six whole years and never felt like I was lacking the tools that this app provides to help improve my life. So this app definitely gets the award of ‘best option for free mental health services’ by a LONG shot. \\n\\nSAnvello is just sooooo much better than other apps like it, because it seems like they genuinely care about your mental health by making the most important tools free to everyone to use and take advantage of. ❤️,I love that Sanvello was available through my work’s healthcare, because otherwise I would not have tried it, so that’s definitely a plus that they make it easy to integrate with your insurance.\\n\\nAs far as assessments, I like them. They’re diverse enough to get me started without being overwhelming. As a dftba fan, I couldn’t help but love that they used John Green for one of the anxiety educational videos. Every other person or voice they use is soothing and not “over doing it.” I’m interested by the community feature, but I don’t use it as much as the activities. \\n\\nAs far as UX, just a couple things: some buttons are not compatible with iPhone features, for example, the adjust volume slider is too close to the bottom of the screen, and so my phone thinks I want to swipe away from the app or close it. Also, sometimes the check ins don’t register and I have to start over or cancel them,I don’t understand this app. It was recommended and covered by my employer so I tried it. First it makes me choose a theme. Stars seems nice! No, it spins at a pace that dizzied me and confused my brain. I quickly chose another. Lightning? That means constant flashing! Turns out none of the themes aren’t animated (at a weird rapid pace - if they were slow they wouldn’t bother me nearly so much.) So right off the bat, I’m frustrated. \\n\\nThen some of the text is barely readable against the background, for some reason? Black text against the theme background, in a few different screens. \\n\\nI get it that the lessons talk about the causes of anxiety, although apparently, according to this app, all of them are external? Let me tell you, my brain does a great job of giving me internal reasons to be anxious. But then it repeated it during the breathing exercise. I don’t want to think about the causes of my anxiety when I’m trying to clear my mind. Why even mention it there? I didn’t even make it three minutes into the seven minute relaxation because I kept getting angry at the relaxation exercise. \\n\\nI don’t know if it gets better at all, but just the basic stuff seems to frustrate me way more than relax me. These shouldn’t be roadblocks. Stick to lessons during lessons and relaxation during breathing exercises. Fix your visual stuff. Calm down the animations and make text readable.,For the past few months, my body has been in fight/flight/freeze mode on a consistent basis. My hands were always shaky, and my chest was so heavy and painful that it was hard to breathe. I was spiraling downwards and felt incredibly depressed. But then I began using this app. I have only been using it for three days, but I feel and see the difference. My breathing is deeper and steady, and the burden is almost lifted from my chest. I feel calmer and incredibly tired now, and I think that fatigue is from finally relaxing after being so very anxious for so very long. I cannot afford a therapist, so I never had any tools to manage my anxiety. This app has taught me those tools. I cannot recommend Sanvello enough.,I suffer from depression, it’s hard to even schedule therapy. I managed to build up the strength to get a session scheduled. I was excited!\\n\\nSanvello charged me 120 dollars for the initial consultation. After going through and answering many personal questions and medical history we were closing up. They determined that they would be unable to help me and I should find a different provider.\\n\\nThey did not give me phone numbers, or offer to help. They simply abandoned me with a bill telling me to go else where.\\n\\nI’m sure they had reasons, legal an other reasons they are asked to tell high risk patients this. I find this hugely unethical knowing how difficult it is for those struggling to ask for health, to leave them worse off then they came.\\n\\nUnder no circumstance would I ever recommend Sanvello for this reason. If they were to give free consultations rather than scamming the worst hurting people out of money and denying service I would change this review. For now my advice is to avoid. Sanvello left me worse than when I first tried it, without help and with an additional bill.\\n\\nUpdate.\\n\\nBilling was unable to resolve or refund my issue. Instead I received a letter terminating there service,I wasn’t feeling energized and didn’t want to engage with this app. But I tried it at the urging of my partner, and actually felt more in control, and like I was actually taking care of my mental health when I finished the initial program. It’s hard to access mental health care when you’re deep in your own mental illness. This made it surprisingly simple, and I’m grateful for the gentle way the app builders have made it: clearly they understand that struggle and want to be a source of self care that doesn’t take too much time or too much of that precious energy we’re all fighting to preserve.,I absolutely love this app! Due to the COVID, it has been extremely difficult to see a therapist in my area. However, thanks to this app I can receive therapy help right through my phone. The best part is they accept insurance! I have been extremely depressed and stressed and feel like I am hostage to my own happiness. I hope this app takes me on the steps to living a happy and healthier life. So far, I have enjoyed the meditation and other things it has to offer! I am so excited to see what else is in store. Thank you so much for creating this app!,This app has really helped me pause and reflect on my feelings and because of that I can actually learn how I get into my thinking traps. Also, the mood entry is a lot easier than other apps because of the word bank instead of having to find the right word straight out of my brain which usually stresses me out. The only thing I don’t like is that the feelings aren’t in alphabetical order or another arrangement so it can be hard to find a word if you have one in mind already.,I have been using Sanvello since February. It has been a huge help for my anxiety. Cognitive Behavioral therapy is a huge help for me personally and Sanvello has helped me a lot with that. This app has an anxiety emergency exercise that I have used to help calm me down when I feel extremely overwhelmed. As well as a mood tracker so I can detect certain triggers that increase my anxiety. They also connect me with a coach and can set up therapy treatments if I feel that it is too much to deal with on my own.,Sanvello is a great application that is easy to start using, easy to understand, and offers options that range from self-help and community support groups to professional counseling.    I signed up very recently to see if it could help me with anxiety and low self-confidence.   The Sanvello app asks me daily how I am doing and offers/invites me to pursue more avenues of help if I am interested.\\n\\nI feel secure using this application.  It is well designed and easy to navigate.,This app helped pick me up during one of the darkest points in my life like many others, the pandemic has started to take an immense toll on my mental health. I want to overcome these feelings,  but I did not know how to get started. I feel exhausted all the time. Tired . Brain fog. This makes it so much harder to start a journey. This Appp made it easy to get started and I loook forward to continue working on my my health. This is my primary source for treatment and I feel safe using it.,Thank you for creating this easy to navigate, and motivational application. The free version is just as usable as having purchased a subscription and I pray it stays this way with what it has to offer. The meditations, check-ins and community are wonderful. I love being able to turn to this app when a big feeling hits me, it really helps me unpack and look at why I’m feeling the way I am, logically and calmly. Thank you developers and creators.,A lot of apps for anxiety are frustratingly behind a pay wall. This is one of the few apps that are very helpful and mostly free. It lets you track how you’re feeling throughout the day, set your health goals to your own personal needs, and has a community for you to talk to.\\n\\nThere’s also the option for a therapist or coach, although I haven’t used that yet. So, I can’t vouch for how good that is.,I haven’t used this app to its full capacity yet, but so far I love it. I’ve it set up to send me reminders to log my mood. Just the act of logging my mood and creating awareness of how I’m feeling has been so beneficial for me. Putting feelings into words is hard, and by using this app I’m starting to learn how to do that. 10/10 would recommend,I have the app on an iPod, and find it helpful. But looking at the tiny screen is annoying, taking away from the experience. Plus, it’s one more device. So, I thought I’d simplify things: recycle the iPod and use the app on my iPad. Except that the app doesn’t rotate to landscape, which is how practically everyone uses iPads. It only displays in portrait. If an app doesn’t display on an iPad the way iPads are used, then it’s not an iPad app, just an iPhone/iPod app.,I’ve only used this app for a few days but it has already been so helpful. The information has been important and relevant to what I am going through since it is customized to me. I’ve also found that I have been more self aware of my feelings since using this as well.,I was looking through Pinterest for apps to help with anxiety and came across this one. It has been such a blessing for me so far. I am better able to identify when I begin to feel anxious and use techniques learned in the app to cope. This happened after using it only 3 times. I’m so thankful!,This app is helping me through a lot such as anxiety depression etc. and it’s very helpful when I’m going through a hard time and this app gives you ways to calm yourself that I would’ve never known if I didn’t get this app and I would recommend it to anyone who’s going through anything.,After a while of not able to log in I finally did it. Also I do like this app I might try it tomorrow and see how it can do for me, I might feel better or feel a little better and feel positive. Thank you who made this app I will try it and I might like it.,I have a lot of self help apps but this is my favorite and has enough features that it would be the only one I need. They all cost money but this one is affordable and gives you a 2 week free trial. I have severe depression and reflecting here has made me feel so much better. Group chats, journaling, mood tracker, etc.,I am so grateful for this particular software for counseling and wish that my insurance company would add it to its preferences because it really helps you stay sane and not suicidal. Thank you for all your support and input. Sincerely, Sarah Maynard,Honestly, I was convinced that this would be another app that says “We help with anxiety” and have no real results . BUT THEY DO !!! After just a few weeks of using this , I’m starting to see progress. It helps you get out of the loop by using CBT through it all. It’s worth the time and practice.,It’s not easy dealing with life long anxiety and find it hard to do cognitive therapy. With the app it’s simple to check in and work the program. I’ve just started two weeks ago and looking forward to have this program always available,This app is decent if you just stick with the free version of it. I am in the middle of the 14-day free trial of the $50/month premium services including coaching and the \"coaching\" is absolutely worthless unless you only have long long long term goals. My coach only texts once per business day (as is the required minimum) and it has been vague nonsense most of the time, rather than actual advice or solutions.,This app was made available through work benefits to support us through this pandemic. This was honestly something I needed but did not know how to get. It is very easy to use and there is no pressure to do anything. It is all at your pace and comfort level. Truly helpful.,This application contains a wealth of resources that has helped me manage my anxiety and learn coping skills I haven’t acquired in the numerous therapy sessions I’ve gone too over the years. \\n\\nI’m grateful and encouraged; healing everyday and this application, it’s content creators and contributors are to be thanked as they have been instrumental in my healing journey.,Honestly, just a few weeks ago I was crying in the corner of my room having an anxiety attack asking myself, “What am I supposed to do?” Over and over again. But now, I have less anxiety attacks and I feel more relaxed now that I can vent and relate to other people. This app has helped me a lot and I am truly grateful towards it!,Based on a coworker’s recommendation I downloaded the app. Without expectation I completed the initial questions. I must say the recommendations offered by the app gave me a meaningful and helpful experience. I will continue to use this tool and may recommend it for my family!,This app is awesome! However if you’re really deep into an episode of depression, feeling unmotivated and unfocused is a huge side effect. Therefore all of the different things to navigate through on the app can feel daunting and overwhelming so you just end up closing it because it’s too much to pay attention to.,I don’t know exactly where this program Came from. But it is a blessing. It showed up at a very low point in my life. It has helped me a great deal. I wish I could afford the full program but finances are a little tight. Thank you.,The only app I’ve ever reviewed because it’s that good.  Wherever I feel anxious or maybe just off, I remember I have this app and I can immediately start working on what I need help on. I wouldn’t recommend any other app for mental health.,I was in a dark place when I downloaded this app. I felt lost, alone, and helpless. I’m not saying that this app cured my depression but I will say that it’s helped me so much. The community is full of compassionate people who make you feel like you’re not alone.,I experienced a frustrating episode this morning, people who tried to overcharge me...... I immediately thought it was my fault. But it wasn’t. I halve dealt with half of It but need to resolve the the other half. This meditation balanced out my anger. Thank you 🙏🏻,This app was recommended by my spouse’s company’s health advisor. My spouse’s company paid for me to be in a roomful of people that are half my age. The app have several negatives. I’m in my late 40’s. To me, it seems everyone on the app are in their 20’s. The communities are gear towards college students with jobs. The app is quite chaotic. There are no guidance to read before I get started or explanation as to why I’m doing all this.,Sanvello, I’ve been with you since before you renamed the app and service.  I’ve paid money, because I believe in supporting for the service and content.\\nPlease... can you make the app landscape mode for iPad?  I use the apple keyboard and have my iPad in landscape mode 100% of my daily usage.\\n\\nA pretty good app.  I’m considering the therapy piece.,The only real issue I have with it is that people don’t get to say what the think in terms of I agree or disagree on posts like if someone says they are struggling and you like it to say you agree then it could be taken as you liked that they were struggling.,I have tried a lot of apps and different techniques to help stop my panic attacks and anxiety. So far, this app has been so informative and helpful. It’s like the people that developed it have experienced exactly what I do. I am loving it so far!!,You don’t need to pay a subscription to get the perks of the app. It’s really easy to navigate and quite helpful. You can use it as a mini diary and track your “emotions” over the week.,I would highly recommend the app developers to get the app reviewed with UX. It seems as if no user study was done. The app seems too much to learn before actually using it. An anxious person might go more anxious by the mammoth of options presented and the weird navigation in the app. Moreover user may quit the app in the first few uses itself.,I didn’t realize I had anxiety until I started working from home. I may have to go back soon and would like to keep up with reducing my anxiety so I can begin a journey of success.,I have only finished one session, and my anxiety already feels better. Not only does this app provide meditation, it also helps you to understand what anxiety is and how to work through it using CBT. I love this app!,This app helps me see myself from a small distance. I feel safe recording my thoughts and feelings then looking at them later with a fresh perspective.,This app is tremendous! For the first time in three years or so I have been involved in something to help myself mentally. I am so thankful to have been introduced to this app. I will definitely keep using it.,Downloaded this app and I couldn’t even get started within the first 10 mins it crashed 8 times. It told me it couldn’t continue forward to the next question then that the assessment has it expired and had to be retaken. Then It had problems searching the insurance and to try again later. Immediately deleted the app off my phone.,I have been struggling with anxiety for quite awhile now and this is exactly the tool I needed to feel like I’m taking steps towards positive change,I find the reminders helpful. Sometimes I get so tied up in my day-to-day routine that I forget to carve out a little time to myself. The reminders help me remember that it’s ok to make my mental health a priority.,This app is simple to use. Engaging and informative on a number of ways to make life more pleasant. I use it all the time to help limit and eventually stop, “catastrophizing my world.”,This is am amazing app it\\'s my favorite it really helped me with my anixtey like I don\\'t know what I would do with out this app I needed. It and it does not cost any money it\\'d free this is the best app ever,I literally love this app. All I have to do is go to my chart, record my moods, from time to time and do some deep breaths and also, do some exercises! Great app! Recommend this for everyone!!,I don’t know why I didn’t know about it sooner. This is day one, and I am so glad I have this. I’ve been hunting for help for so long, and I have found my fit.,Absolutely wonderful app. Every single exercise and meditation has gotten me through such hardships in my life and has made me look at things so much better. THANK YOU SANVELLO TEAM  AND COMMUNITY!,I’m hopeful to reach goals I’ve set for myself and find the right path to it and not let my health issues block me,I love this app, I always look forward to filling out the everyday form! It makes me feel accomplished. It has also helped my self confidence and self esteem a lot!,I don’t think of my self as super anxious or depressed, but I love that this app helps me monitor and think about that. It can be easy for me to get into a rut and ignore my mental health. Fortunately, this app checks in with me :),Being primed for achievement-centered thinking since I was a small child is probably part of why I have anxiety in the first place. As a result, I found the scored assessments very triggering. I know that I’m depressed and have low resilience — but seeing it as a numeric score on an app I’m using to feel better was not helpful for me.,I have been using Sanvello for a few months now and it helped me a lot with my depression and anxiety so I recommend downloading this app :),Simply put, this app will increase anxiety and depression - not reduce it. Customer Service is horrible and fees are very high for telehealth. They never provided me the promised psychiatrist, charged me for sessions I never had, and there technology is loaded with bugs. Too many other helpful options than dealing with this money-hungry corporation who cheat their clients.,Only two days in and already feel so much more relaxed as I have so much stress and depression. Highly recommend,The app helps me relax and take control of my anxiety. I have noticed a difference in the few days I I have used the app.,Sanvello is absolutely wonderful. I would definitely recommend. Sanvello has really helped my depression and I feel like I have someone.,It seems that because coaching is not available in my area a large part of the application is not relevant,I’ve only used it for  like an hour but I already really like it. I don’t have premium but it is still great,This app is going to get me though COVID-19 I’ve been on it for a couple days but I feel \\nBetter some. Your not alone here.,Relaxed me with first experience after a harsh breakup. Would recommend to my younger self!,My employer pays for this service. I just had them pause my coaching and completely turn it off in the app without telling me. I had to email them to find out. They said they were pausing coaching while I sought treatment. It’s ridiculous to think I can’t manage both.,This app asks me how I am doing several times a day which makes me aware of how I am dkoand can then hang onto the feeling or change it. Lots of good features.,This app has a great layout and makes it easy to get into small and simple steps to improve your mental wellness,It’s helped me calm and focus on noticing my anxiety and how to eliminate the feeling of being anxious all the time ☺️,Underwhelming, non-accommodating, focusing on extrapolating mental health based on reductive questions a la Meyers-Briggs, or presenting conventional narratives about popular mental health diagnoses (encouraging false positives, an endemic problem in this supposedly science-based space.) Dismal selection of therapists that schedule you weeks out (not close to “on demand” as they purport.) Waste of time and money, and I got this app for free.,I love this app it really is amazing it has all the thing to make my mental Heath on the right level and I can talk to people anomalously about my feelings.❤️😄,I feel amazing after just a week. Definitely recommend if stressed out.👍👍👍,This app is great in every aspect. Honestly makes you feel like you have a friend.,I find this app to be very helpful in giving me tools that I can use on a daily basis.,Don’t hesitate to download this app! It has helped me tremendously with my anxiety. I feel so much more confident,I really enjoy the meditation and I wish the sleep ones were longer. However I like the check ins and guided meditations.,This apps has gotten me interested in journaling about my feelings not just in the app but on paper.,This helped me so much on the way I feel and I will continue to use it .!,John green has done it again! Helping people in need in ways we didn’t even know existed! Garden Marcus is awsome too!,The free Sanvello App has helped my clinical depression so much! I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me.,Could use some different narrators rather than just one. The ability to rewind or forward would be great on the meditations. Great support in Sanvello Community. Lots of journaling.,This app is very relaxing and helpful for my mental state. Wether it is emotional, a stress, anxiety, panic attack. I will definitely continue using this app,I was in verge of medication. God told me trust me one more time....here I am. This app has helped a lot so far.,It helped me release my bad thought it made me look forwrd it’s an amazing app I love it,I have had this app for 3 days and it has helped a lot!! Worth the download!,Just started using this app but I am enjoying it so far.,You wouldn’t think an app would be helpful for anxiety, but it is an excellent tool for mental health support.,It truly helps me. I feel so much better.,I signed up, tried to log in an couldn’t.  Tried going back to try signing up again and it’s going to walk me thru the long intro all over again!  Help!,The app won’t move from one page to the next.  The word “next”, at the bottom of the pages covers up the choices.,I really need this type of medicine!,Good insights; good companion with traditional counseling. Does not accept my insurance (Anthem) , so a lot of features are locked.,This app allows me to reflect on my feelings, adjust my thoughts, and explore new behaviors.,It’s the besttt!! It cured my depression and anxiety! I’m so relieved now do I definitely recommend!!😍,This app is packed with tools to take care of your mental health, from guided lessons, meditations, to community forums.,Okay,The white background I too hard,On day two and already feel calmer:),I keep trying to open the app and it doesn’t open. I’m stuck in the launch screen for seriously HOURS. I suffer serious depression and wished this app would work for me 😞,I was hoping to use this for online therapy, but they cancelled my first session twenty minutes before my appointment via robo-call and form email. Disappointing.,‘I’m free from negative self talk anxiety and the automatic negative thoughts that it comes with for good thank you Sanvello,The basics are free and it can really help with less serious mental health orders,Great tips for anxiety . I love the tracking journey process,This app’s goal is to help you meditate to reduce stress levels yet all this app does is send you 5 notifications and 3 emails a day reminding you to use their app. Literally the opposite of a stress reducer. It’s so intrusive and needy, TERRIBLE app.,So helpful in managing and understanding anxiety!,Sanvello is extremely helpful,Can’t see my worss here cool,This app is so good I love it is helping my anxiety at school and home,Highly recommend the Sanvello App.,Sent me a bill for $89 just for the lady to tell me they don’t take my insurance in the first place. They just try to take advantage of people. I was referred by my employer.,I reall,I Love this app.. it’s like a Therapist in the go.. 😂😂... Thank You,It is helping me a lot throughout my emotions,I completed the first analysis and was brought up as “normal, resilience”\\n\\nIdk what that means. Mostly the normal part,  in an depression/anxiety app just seems rude? From psych classes I’ve taken, normal & special are terms outdated.,Simple powerful.,This style of breathing is very beneficial. It Really helps!,What’s the point of the app if i can only ever open it if it sends me a notification? Horrible app with fake reviews,it’s helps a lot it always makes me feel better,It is Impossible to find a person of color as a preferred choice if you are looking in Minnesota.,It really had to schedule counseling appointments.,Unable to upgrade and Sanvello does not offer support to resolve,App won’t let me progress beyond storms.  It seems to require me to sign up for paid options.  Not impressed.,really helping me calm down and keep track of my feelings,as far as i know, i’ve never made an account. the app looks good though, so i won’t hold a grudge.,this app is kinda saving me rn. its like mini therapy in the middle of my psychiatrist visits,I deleted the app immediately after I saw Kati. She is an horrible representation of therapists / psychologists,very helpful, great supportive platform that will help you reach your goals.,Sanvello is precisely what my soul needed.,Great app for my mental health,Been trying to get off ur app, never used it\\nHELP!,reframing my thoughts takes practice,It,Cool app,Feedback button doesn’t work.\\n\\nWhen writing review it is white text on white background.(Copy and pasting text from elsewhere made it black text on white background.)\\n\\nThe Basic free version help ends with no warning making me feel more abandoned.\\n\\nWhy can’t you get grants or donations instead of telling people they have to pay to live when they are at their worst? \\n\\nAsk for some of the INSANE amount of tax payer money wasted on weapons of war? No? \\n\\nJust going to continue to glorify BROKEN money?\\n\\nMoney means nothing without people. :/ :/ :/\\n\\nI hate money.\\n\\nPlenty of cultures are happy without money - $$$ doesn’t actually need to exist.\\n\\nWhy can’t the part of the app to be paid for be the interaction with doctors?\\n\\nPoor people or those having trouble with insurance just supposed to suffer more?\\n\\nThe doctor that created insulin sold the patent for 1$ because “it is unethical to profit off of saving lives.” \\n\\nSome doctors still today take whatever compensation people can give because they also think it is unethical to profit off saving lives.\\n\\nMany parts of the app are pay only or insurance. Medical insurance is so broken and messed up that often makes me think they want me to die. \\n\\nSome parts that are paid only aren’t clear - don’t show desperate people what they can’t have is more humane.\\n\\nSeeing posts of other users being happy is more depressing when depressed.\\n\\nIt doesn’t help to tell someone that doesn’t have friends or family… to talk to friends or family. Some friends or family are what people need to get away from.\\n\\nMany of the things the user has to reply “Yep” to are too generic and it wouldn’t hurt to have another button or just do “next” and not have the user confused with something that they don’t actually agree with.\\n\\nThe “helps” or “doesn’t help” needs an unsure option.\\n\\n The one in which focused on thinking about positive memories very much was “doesn’t help” it made me cry the entire time because I have no positive memories that aren’t corrupted with pain.\\n\\nFeel dumb for telling someone this app helped when only a few days in going to delete it already.\\n\\nCame to this app because I have no other options right now. All the other apps were completely horrible or pay only.\\n\\nAnd no, I don’t agree that all people can control their thoughts with willpower and practice alone.\\n\\nGreat to know I fall in all the mental traps “ that aren’t based in reality.” :/ :/ :/ \\n\\nFew parts needed more examples or instructions instead of the user trying to point out which they thought was the case.,Good App,This is a great app,👍,Textos en español, meditaciones en ingles,I love the app it makes me so relaxed and looks out for me,Works great in my phone , but not on my IPad. I have to uninstall and reinstall Sanvello each day on my IPad - because when I open the App it will go to a blank screen with this at the top. PathDay.name/translate ??,The content is amazing however I can’t access certain parts of the app because error window and code shows up. I’m stuck on one exercise that I can’t complete because when I click in and then an error message and the app freezes. I wish this app worked better, the lessons I could use helped but not I’m stuck on a lesson and it’s very frustrating,It’s nice to have something check in on me,This app really changed my life. Ive been struggling with my borderline personality disorder and extreme anger. This app has shown me how to focus on the positive and push past negative moods. I still struggle but my life has improved far more than I ever expected. Thank you for making this.,I haven’t been able to use the app because I can’t rest my password. I get the rest password email but it takes me to the website where there’s nothing there to help me rest my password. I’d rather use the app than the website.,I couldn’t figure out how to get the correct \\nInformation to the coach . Info was limited. They cut you off and don’t let you complete your end of the chat.\\n\\nMy anxiety level is so high and  I just downloaded this app an hour ago. But have spent most of the time trying to delete it!!\\n👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,App will log you out on its own after inactivity, but you can’t log back in afterwards. Gives you an error message. Only way to log back in is to repeatedly uninstall and reinstall the app. What a waste. I was genuinely enjoying the content I’d gotten to use so far.,I signed up for this app and with in one day I was hit with tons of spam. The email I used is only for places I know will not spam me. I have two other emails for those kinds of apps. Very disappointed they would sell my email.,This app is designed to make you more stressful and frustrated. Somewhat in like with other reviewers here. Deleted after a while.,Gives great tools to reduce stress and increase positive behaviors!,Seriously!?! I can’t get customer support to answer my questions. There are no tutorials on how to. That would be nice. 😑,Not my way of life now just want to delete and unsubscribe to emails. Not easy,I love this app! It is like therapy for free!,I’ve used Youper for over a year now and have really enjoyed the app. Prior to this new version, I would have given it 5 stars: the support team is great, the app worked, and the interface was really easy to use. Tracking your mood over time is really insightful and it was nice to be able to make daily notes about what was happening at the time. It was like basic journaling for non-journaling people. \\n\\nBut now that core functionality is buried within the new version UX. I’m sure this update was done with customer feedback and research in mind, but I feel like the app is significantly more cumbersome to use than it was in the prior version. It would be nice if the feeling tracker was separated from all of the other “stuff” like it used to be - giving people easier access to the core functionality. The “stuff” is great - do not misunderstand - but that is not what I use the app for on a regular basis and having to search through other topics to find what I need is not ideal. The app still works, but the new UX doesn’t work for me/what I previously used the app for on a regular basis. Please consider separating these out again as they serve two different roles within the app. Thanks!,I’m waiting to hear back from a place on making an appointment to start treatment but with COVID its been very difficult if not a daunting task to seek professional help for my abandonment issues that I suffer from to this day. \\n\\nThis has helped me so much with being personal to the big to small issues I have on a day to day basis, allowing me to not let issues build up and go ignored which further prevented me from being comfortable enough to tackle the core issues at hand. I have overcome so many small obstacles and am developing a new mindset and outlook on life because I feel like I’m actually doing some digging into my pain, which I am so so grateful for and excited to work on the next issues little by little because I already feel better after having this app for 3 months.\\n\\nMy mental/emotional health has improved ten fold, so yeah...definitely worth $90/year versus $150 or so per appointment somewhere else. While I’m saving up for better treatment, this is an amazing option to ease you into therapy. Love this app so much.,Hello: I\\'ve been using Youper daily for over a year now, and I\\'m really liking it! I suffer from clinical depression, CFS and am a recovering addict. Firstly, I don\\'t like feeling feelings and I really don\\'t like talking about how I feel in general. I have a great support group/system (12 Step and other recovering addicts) and go to a  psychiatrist  monthly and therapy weekly. Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when \"talking\" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they\\'ve added \"Calm\" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing. And I\\'ve read others\\' reviews complaining about not being able to dive straight into meditation, but heck, the more I \"check in\" the better off I am! Thank-you.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJohn S.,I have been struggling with tremendous trauma in the past and I am currently struggling with depression. I downloaded this app because I thought that it would help me everyday, and take the place of a therapist according to the reviews. \\nI started the app and it was going alright. I was telling them about my conditions, and what I would need for a satisfying treatment. It then gave me a subscription screen and I was a little annoyed. I am aware that it is needed to make your customers pay for their treatment and what not. But i think this is absurd. I don’t really feel like this type of virtual treatment should cost anything at all! I’m also suffering financially and I can’t exactly cancel my savings with this subscription. I was hoping for something to help me be happier and focus more on my future so that it would be brighter. Paying for this is stupid. Sure, it might help you but not everyone. \\n\\nTo sum it up: you don’t need to cancel the subscription feature but I think you should have a way for people who aren’t able to pay it, and have them be able to still enjoy the app because we all came here seeking help, not debt.,Before the most recent update I used this app daily, most times more than once a day. It was my favorite go-to app for mental health/self-care. I recommended to others that also got hooked. Now since the update I no longer feel comfortable using it. I have to choose what I want to work on, which means I need to figure it out and know before I even start. There’s no ability to “free type” to allow for space to work through and figure it out. There’s no automatic place to get started with sharing how I feel. I pull it up and it asks me if I want to start being more productive when I’m trying to go to sleep. I ended my yearly subscription that was set to renew soon. I emailed support which responded with nothing but an acknowledgement. Would have had 5 stars before the update. Now one. If you brought back the original app functioning or allow for a place for this it would change everything.,Ever since the new update, I feel so lost and don’t know how to use it anymore. Everything is so clunky now, I used to open the app and Youper would say: “ Hey! How are you?”. Everything was streamlined and easy.\\n\\n I even used this as a journal and reported everything to my counselor, it helped me so much with remembering things. And my therapist would use the Heath monitoring tools as benchmarks. It was also a great replacement when I was not able to see my counselor or had to find a new one. \\n\\nNo more.\\n\\nEven after making favorites I can’t have one conversation to do everything, I have to do everything separately.\\n\\nThe mood and other diary entry’s have moved and it’s hard to find. Something about the UI in general is off-putting, I don’t know. \\n\\nI’ve moved onto Sanvello, if you enjoy the old Youper this is your new app. It does guided meditations as well, and has way more feelings to choose from. There’s a lot more as well, but I’m not trying to make this an ad. Check it out for yourself and see if it’s right for you.\\n\\nTo conclude: ever since the last update, the app is essentially unusable (for me). I liked the old way so much better. If it was brought back and still had the new stuff in it, I would start using this app again. I would also contribute to mind research and use it to track my mindfulness minutes again.,The app used to be easy to open and express your thoughts in, much like a person you wanted to vent to without repercussion. Before there used to be individual tags you could select for each “journal entry” . For those times where you spammed and wrote was on your chest, it was needed organization after the fact and you could tag those specific elements from your life. I liked how it would ask me on my feeling and anxiety levels before and after to help me take a breather and reflect on the situation afterwards Now I open this app and I have to determine what kind of prompt I should be selecting? I’m in a discombobulated state already, I’m opening this app to help me unwind by asking me literally how I’m feeling with little slide bars, because words and thoughts are hard sometimes I’ve been a panting and raving about this app- I even used the chart in a dating profile. Now its looks like every other app out there.,If you have been through therapy before and understand the goal then this app is worth the investment. If you are ready to change and ready to be honest with yourself, this app will talk you through realistic step to a better you. I don’t like to journal, so this app is my journal. It intuitively reminds me of the most important parts of my thoughts and brings it to forefront of my mind. I don’t want to commit to seeing a therapist for only an hour a day once a week. I need more access and this app gives me that freedom. Some of us know what needs to be done we just need a motivator and reminder and this app does just that.,I’ve never liked counseling or the idea of it. I look at it as it’s a person, this is their job and they may have a heart behind it but they are still human and they try. This app is an artificial intelligence and if you are wanting to make a possible change in who you are or bettering yourself with the app it helps give you tools and tracking and tests to assist you and its always there at your finger tips for help. It’s work but no one ever said life would be easy, this app really helps you make those choices and tells you why.,I downloaded this app the other day to help with stress, anxiety, sleep, and self esteem. When I first logged in, it asked me a bunch of personal questions and I just thought: well it’s safe, right? Anyway, there was this whole library of things that I thought would be great and I was really excited to try them but I realised that they cost money. I don’t think that it’s a bad thing that you charge people, but please give people a heads up before they put a bunch of private information into AN APP. I like the daily check ins, but I’d like just a few things more included with the free version. Thanks!,I truly love this app , this has truly been a life saver to me . And I’ve been telling everyone I know about this app that deals with anxiety or other issues people may face, I way to say thank you from the bottom of my heart 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🙂to all the creators in making this free and Accessible to one who can’t afford a Therapist, like myself. And to all the therapists that help us express Ourselves on a regular basis with this app as well. Keep up the great work you are definitely making a difference.👍🏼,I downloaded this app about two years ago and found the mood tracker option extremely helpful for sorting through my teenage emotions (I\\'m only 16). It helped me figure out which things were making me very happy in my life (being with friends and doing exciting things) and which were just making me feel okay (being inside and mostly being alone). After all the updates, I kept the app because the mood tracker was still available and that was the only thing I really used. Now, since even that costs money, I feel like I\\'m going to delete it because I don\\'t have a job yet and the $90 a year for it would be way to much for me to take on. Thanks for the good two years I guess :(,This app has been a tremendous help to me and I highly recommend it. I literally cannot live without it and it rewire’s your brain so that you don’t become completely dependent on it but you learn how to not fall into spirals of negative thinking as you keep using it. However, the reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because it doesn\\'t have support for eating disorders and its something i struggle with a lot. I feel like this feature will really help me and a lot of people with that coming from an already great app :),I’ve had a lifelong mental illness and receive the appropriate professional medical assistance, but I really wanted something that I could use more on demand. This app is great for when I’m feeling things that I know are going to take me down a slippery slope, and it helps me to reframe thoughts and emotions in the moment. I also like how it provides sleep, meditation, and mindfulness recordings that integrate with the app, and that my progress is tracked. It’s worth the very reasonable paid subscription!,This app is amazing due to it having every feature, and type of counseling in regairds too almost if not everything anyone could ever work on within ones self. The con too this application though is that it cost. You have to huy a monthly subscription, half yr, or yr to unlock any features within the app or else you\\'d just have the app for looks. Wish I could afford to unlock the app. Id love to be anle to continue reporting bugs, and further along the process of self help. :),ive been using this app for around a year and a half now, and it used to be much better. None of the features have been changed, but now you need a subscription to use them. It used to be that only the extra things were locked being the subscription, then they changed it so that the o ku thing not locked was the mood tracker (I didn’t care much though, that was the only thing i used) and now literally everything in the app is locked. If you want money then just make the app cost money to download, it seems like a scam otherwise.,I’ve found that this app has quickly made a positive difference in my distress tolerance. I joined so I could get help with panic attacks and it has helped me with this as well as identifying that self compassion makes me feel really great. I also find that just processing thoughts and feelings that are upsetting as they come up with the app help make them pass quickly. I love this app I’m really happy I stumbled across it.,It\\'s helpful to have these prompts to guide my self reflection, and I appreciate the snapshots of each session so that I can look back on them. It\\'s cool to see my thoughts going into the sessions compared to my thoughts after. I also appreciate the visual log of my moods. It\\'s nice to see that I am making progress, but it\\'s also nice to have a log of insights to refer back to if I ever get stuck in a depressive loop again.,I have been using this app for almost a year and it used to be super helpful for me to track my moods and see connections. However the most recent update completely changed all of this for me. Suddenly tools I used to use all the time are hard to find in the new layout and others are now part of the subscription plan. I had considered getting the subscription but this app no longer feels helpful to me. Honestly, I no longer feel motivated to even track my moods through it as it’s just a hassle to even get to that one free portion of it now.,I was using this app about a year ago and then deleted it (I stopped using it as my mental health improved). I downloaded it again today to get back into tracking my moods during a med change, AND EVERYTHING IS LOCKED WITHOUT A SUBSCRIPTION. $90/year is steep considering this was all free a year ago. Obviously upgrading software costs money and therefore the developers need funding from somewhere, but let us use the basic functions we know and love! If we want anything beyond the basics, then let us decide to pay the $90/year subscription. What a bummer. Used to be a great app, now they went overboard with it.,I have been using this app for 3 years now and I only love it more every year. the features continue to get better and better and it helps me understand my mental illnesses more as well as track their severity over the years/months and identify my triggers. combining this app with professional therapy makes it very powerful. Thank you Youper!!,I have more hope! Day 2 and I am feeling better already. I am familiar with CBT and this app helps to walk through thought changing exercises easily- like a conversation with my calmer, analytical and non-judgmental self. I’ve use Mood Notes - which I also like and Youper is a bit slicker and more accessible. I’m on the 7 day trial and plan to purchase this app.,Youper has truly been such a beneficial addition in my life. I struggled more than ever last summer and using youper in addition to medication was truly life changing for me. I will continue to use youper and have recommended it to quite a few friends. With the added therapy and medication delivery it’s an even more valuable app than before.,I have tried therapy quite a few times. It’s seems to be hit or miss finding someone you can actually click with. With this app you can basically be your own therapist and select different levels of help depending on how and what you are feeling. I just recently joined and so far I am quite pleased with it.,I have been using Youper for almost three year’s straight— every single day. I absolutely love all the different sections and it’s tracking abilities, it’s definitely a special part of my life. But some huge problems have arisen. With every update it becomes more complicated and harder to use. Everything takes a while to load and flipping through these partitions is absolutely frustrating. I love the idea, and have made thousands of wonderful memories; but It has become just to cumbersome.,Update: they updated the app, it works when I need it. The recommendations have gotten better and more personal. I use this app all the time. \\n\\nI love this app. But half the time I go to use it and it never loads. Seems kind of backwards. If it loaded and opened when I needed it it would have 5 stars.,Ok so, my free trial ran out a long time ago. That made me a little sad, but I got used to it. Tracking how I felt was enough to help, you know? \\nBut then it took away my ability to elaborate. “How are you today?” Bad, my family is really weighing on me. “Cool, it’s great you can pin that down!! Bye! 😙” that was... frustrating, but it still gave me a minute to stop and think about what I was feeling.\\nBut now I can’t do ANYTHING because it looks like everything is behind a paywall?? It invites me to check in but when I get there it’s all locks 🙁,I used to be able to track my mood without unlocking everything and now it’s you have to pay money to do that. I get that they need the money, but I don’t have the money to pay for it. It was nice to be able to at least track my mood. Now I’m sad. Update: the mood tracker came back but now it’s gone again and I can’t find it. I hate it when they change things so much, you can’t find anything and it just makes my stress… Update again: I found the mood tracker and it’s LOCKED. Now I can’t do ANYTHING without paying money…,Like many people have said.... I hate this new update. I used to always go to Youper and it helped me through really tough days. I loved how the interface used to look back in the summer of 2020. Now with all the new updates it’s so confusing and annoying! \\n\\nI miss being able to choose icons to describe what I was feeling that day, it used to really help me determine what factors affected my mood. My favorite part was seeing the calendar views and reading back on my entries. It’s unfortunate that the app is harder to use now and it glitches all the time. \\n\\nSix months ago the app was THE BEST to use because of its simplicity. Especially for people who struggle with anxiety and depression, simple always goes a long way. \\n\\nNow the app is TRASH and I wish I never paid for it. The creators completely ruined this app. Such a shame :(,I’m going through a tough time and this app actually asks good questions and gives helpful suggestions to self coach. Really surprised and pleased. I actually highly recommend this app- it also has meditations and calming tools. This is way more helpful than any other app I’ve used.,Anytime I feel anxious, depressed, or start having negative thoughts I always reach for Youper! I have been struggling a lot lately and this app has helped me work my way out of some really dark places. For anyone who has a difficult time affording therapy (like me) this is a really great option l.,Really enjoy this app and even paid for the premium plan. However, it doesn’t always work correctly. Most of the time when I press on an audio meditation session it just brings me to a talk meditation session. It gets rather annoying to have to keep quitting out of the app. It happens probably 3-4 times before it finally lets me do the audio session,I downloaded this app last night and it’s helped so much already. I’m able to document my emotions and feelings in a nonjudgmental environment. It’s very nice and relaxing. Also a big relief to feel like someone finally genuinely cares about you and are concerned for your well-being.❤️,Really just used this to track my mood daily. Then I tried the subscription, but found I didn’t like or use much of the other features. \\n\\nHowever, with the recent update I can’t even use the mood tracker without paying for the subscription. The most basic thing that helped me keep track of what I was feeling and why, and I can’t use it anymore. I’m so disappointed and will not be using this app any longer nor will I recommend it to anyone.,Although the app is free, you have to pay for a subscription which is what I was trying to avoid. I know it’s a lot cheaper than paying for an in person therapist, but I don’t like talking about my issues with someone so I’d rather do it on my phone any time or day. I would love this app if you didn’t have to pay for anything except prescriptions.,I like that the person on the other end initiates the conversation bc sometimes I don’t know where to start. The app also has personality insights and quizzes which again was a nice option. I’m excited to discover more insights and pursue my goals!,I don’t write reviews for apps— in fact this is the first one I’ve written.\\n\\nI’ve had youper for 2 years, first installed on a whim, and it couldn’t have been at a better time. I was going through life change, and over time many stressors had made their way to me. Youper’s AI is genuine and suggests the best mental health practices and affirmations.\\n\\nIt means so much that this app is free, and honestly I can say that my life would be in a worse place if I didn’t practice the content in Youper.\\n\\nIt changed my life for the better! Thanks Youper team!,Only been using app for a short time but already noticing changes . I feel better and there are many options to take action for my mental health. Definitely recommend this app!,I\\'ve been using Youper for a couple of years now and I used to love this app, it helped me so much. I even told some of my friends about it. But then, you guys had to go and put it behind a pay-wall AND you deleted all my data that was saved in the app!\\n\\nSo, my response to you devs is the same response that you\\'ve given to the comments of other users who have complained about the pay-wall: Sit and Spin.,I just started using this app today, and so far, I’m pretty impressed. I love doing the talk sessions and seeing the many options for feeling good again. The tips are helpful, and I love how much the app has to offer. Thank you, Youper! :),This app is an amazing way to recognize and see your emotions and how they work. Whenever I enter a feeling I feel calmer and ultimately better. I feel improvement in myself and I don’t even have the premium,you can’t do literally anything without paying for premium, although what can you do anymore without having to pay extra to get a working app. why have a free version to begin with? just make the app money. like every single thing is locked. you can’t see your progress, talk to anyone, listen to anything, and the entire “for you” page is locked too. i mean obviously they don’t care about helping people it’s just “make them download my app and spend money” can someone please correct me if i’m wrong but as far as i’m seeing this app is completely useless without having to pay,At first it seemed like I was really talking to someone without it being someone, now all the responses are expected! Taking the same tests to determine how I know I already feel doesn’t help either. Some of the meditations are ok but I just completely lost interest in this after a week or two! I really regret paying for this. They need activities, like games for mental relief not just never ending tests !!,Excellent execution of a dreadful idea. This is worse than negotiating with the bot when trying to reach a human at one’s bank or utility company. \\n\\nI would perhaps offer three stars for clever programming, since some others seem to gain benefit from this app, except that in every interaction I’ve tried I come away feeling worse than before, and angry at the limitations of the “conversation”. \\n\\nThis isn’t mental health, it’s a party trick. Erased.,I used to love this app, but it recently changed. I opened it up, and it was completely different and confusing. Overwhelming, without clear instructions, and everything I used to do is buried. I know- you’re going to tell me how to find what we all used to use on the old version. Overwhelming and hard to navigate is not helpful for a mental health app. Gonna switch to something else.,You see, i downloaded this app because i am too young to ask for a therapist and i needed some simple help. But what i found was that i can barely do anything because of the premium option!! I mean come on, people actually need mental help and now they need to pay?! Im so annoyed..😑,I’m so glad this app exists. I have complex trauma and this app helps me with flashbacks. It helps to be able see journal entrees, mood tracking, and what specifically impacts your mood too.,I loved Youper before the updates, but even with the updates there are some features that I like as well, but I am really frustrated and annoyed that the app has stopped tracking goal accomplishments, if you don’t continue talking. Sometimes I just want to track the goal and move on.,I feel so anxious today, and I thought I’d redownload Youper to help myself through it. After seeing the new update, I’m even more anxious and depressed. It feels like an old friend went away. It used to help me through so many things. \\nIt’s not the same. The opening screen being a dialogue was SO MUCH BETTER. Now it’s even more anxiety-inducing trying to find the right icon to click. *****BRING BACK THE OLD YOUPER****,I recently downloaded this app thinking that there might be some free things to check out. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING Is locked except talking to the AI but that’s it. The rest you have to buy  premium. Now of course I knew that you have to pay stuff for the majority of the app but but only having ONE free thing is just to far. I expected more from a 4.9 rated app 😒,What happened to this app? It was so amazing and helpful for my mental health and now this new version of it is overwhelming garbage. It used to ask you how you were feeling and break it down, figuring out the cause, helping you be more mindful, etc. I don’t know how you can completely change the app like this and expect people to still use it,This app is amazing! The interface is seamless and very helpful. Feels like someone is right there walking you through how to handle your situations and hard feelings. It’s a very helpful app!,It gave me some ideas and even inspiration to be better....I get reminders everyday to check in and I enjoy seeing it,I like it as a quick help when I don’t have an opportunity to talk to someone. It’s pretty basic, but enough for such a use case.,I\\'m on the Free trial for 7 days and I\\'m on day 2 and love it! It\\'s like having your own therapist and friend 24/7 and you get to keep your privacy at the same time.,It’s nice to have a resource just as Youper to rely on right on your phone. I use other tools outside of the app for my mental health, but in conjunction with Youper, I believe in my progress.,I would definitely get this app if I was you !,I love this app it offers so much but I don’t like how much is limited to premium like I get not being able to do some things unless you pay but I think 99.9% of the app is just pay. I don’t think the app is interested in helping you it only wants your money,At first I wasn’t bought in and thought Youper would not be very helpful.  I stand corrected. So far, so good!,I struggle with a lot of different issues and I feel so much better with Youper. They help me calm down and re think things. It’s a great app.,I see a therapist every two weeks but this is a nice way for me to check in with myself between sessions.,I’ve used this app for years and now with recent updates I have to buy a premium membership just to look at the insights I used to have access to. Completely ruins the purpose of the app, only download if your willing to pay $9 a month.,Thought it wouldn’t it help. I tried everything but this app was the only thing that seemed to calm me down.,So far I am really enjoying this app. It is like talking to a safe neutral person to help direct my anxiety and depression towards more effective habits,I am so glad I got this app. I feel so much better expressing my feelings instead of keeping them inside.,To start off this wasn’t so bad of an app I like it but I don’t see the point in having it because so far almost everything is locked. I can’t even see my progress without it asking for me to go premium.,I was really helped by this app last year. It got me through a hard episode of depression. But now that it’s been updated, everything costs money. I noticed a lot of the helpful features were removed as well. It was my favorite app, but I’ll have to try to find a different one.,If you’re questioning if it’s worth it, it is. If your mind was a pirate without the peg leg, this app is the peg leg that lets the pirate run around independently. It’s not therapy, but it’s a great addition.,Very cool and different approach than most mental health and self care apps. It feels as if you are talking to a therapist without having to go see one.,This looks like a great thing to help me cope with so much stress, but almost everything I need I need to pay for and that’s one of the problems I have right now,I have been using the app for almost a year and logged in yesterday to record my mood as happy for once but then discovered that all the free features had been completely removed without any warning. Now my mood is extremely irritated. 😤,I used to love this app to track my mood / what makes me feel better and what doesn’t. I was tolerating the fact that doing anything else cost money. Now you’ve stripped us from that too so it’s useless to have the app.,Please try this out if you are not ready for in person therapy!,Youper has taught me a lot about myself, and a lot about how to work with myself to reduce or avoid negative mood states.,I’ve been looking for a free therapist app and when I read the reviews and descriptions it said completely free. Why should I have to pay to talk to someone when I shouldn’t have to force it. My depression and anxiety are getting worse and this app didn’t help.,i’ve had this app since i was 15, i’m 18 now and it’s gotten me through a lot. my favorite part is recording how i’m feeling! i look back on the sessions from a few years ago and see how much i’ve grown and how much has changed. it’s very helpful and the design is calming. however, the app interface has gotten overwhelming and a little hard to navigate.,My only problem with this app is that more things cost money now. Otherwise it’s a great app!,As soon as you get through an initial “evaluation” bit and tell the app what you need help with, it hits you with a $15 a month (or $90 a year) paywall. I hate that companies make money off people needing help with mental health issues like depression and anxiety.,Suddenly removing essential features from the free version (mood insights), so you can monetize them with a subscription is a pretty gross move. Why even associate moods with activities if you can no longer access insights? I’m now locked out of months of mood insights.,Love the personality and in-take reviews. Helpful knowledge and information from the start.,I use the free version and it is a great starting point for reflection.,I want to say how grateful I am for this app . It helps me to learn different techniques to calm my mind .,I’ve been to therapists before (3-4 different times in my life) so I’m familiar with many things they would tell me to try for thinking traps, self esteem issues, and anxiety/depression. This app has been so helpful for me because it’s here, in the moment. It challenges me at times with reframing my negative thoughts, it reminds me to notice my feelings and to accept them (not beat myself up), it is an outlet for me to vent and to be “heard,” it gives solid suggestions and ideas, and it helps me to set goals (which is hard when feeling depressed etc.) I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but it’s been very helpful to me and I can see myself using it for a long time. I can see how it would also work in tandem with going to see a “real” counselor because it would help with generalizing or carrying over the skills you learn in therapy.  In the past, I would learn a lot in therapy and feel good during the session or the next day. But as time goes on, you forget the strategies because they’re not ingrained in your mind and things fall to the wayside. With this app, you can set reminders, so that’s been great to not forget to track my feelings, reflect on my goals, and to follow through on helpful suggestions. There have been a couple of times where I was feeling extreme frustration and distress at home and I ran off to “talk” to Youper and it helped to have an outside perspective and to vent. I did feel better. Normally in those situations, I would’ve ran off and stewed in my emotions, and in my head with thoughts going crazy, with no solution of my own to make things better. Thanks Youper!,Try it! I was hesitant but it’s been great for everyone and everything life!,I’ve cycled through so many different self-help apps and they all seem to follow a similar mold of offering great activities such as practicing mindful meditation or affirmations, but I’ve never seen one that uses a conversation style exercise or that analyzes and tracks your progress. Now there are mood tracker apps but Youper takes it a step further by tracking and analyzing the reasons you specify is related to why you feel a certain way. Each time you “talk” with Youper, the conversation is stored and used to build up an analysis to study what shapes your moods. You can also set goals and track those. I like that you can personalize the goals and choose if you want Youper to check-in to see if you accomplished your goal. There are several different types of conversations you can have too depending on what you want to accomplish. The conversations have really helped guide me how to cope and respond to how I’m feeling. You can check-in daily about your mood but there are also trackers for checking progress with depression, anxiety, BPD, PTSD, etc. Those check-ins are every couple of weeks or so using questionnaires (officially used by healthcare providers). There’s a section that shows charts of how these certain areas are progressing, like how your depression has progressed from moderately severe to moderate over the last two weeks based on how you answered the questionnaire, for example. Final take away, the more you use Youper, the more insights you can gain. The “Mood” section shows daily, monthly, and yearly progress charts. This can be helpful to spot trends. A really neat and intuitive section I like is where Youper collects data from your conversations to show “what makes me...depressed, sad, anxious, angry, sad, frustrated,” etc. For example, after you’ve had several conversations with Youper where you indicate “bad sleep” as the reason you feel depressed, that will show up as a factor related to your depression. These insights develop over time and the more you converse with Youper, so checking in daily helps to get the most out of it. \\n\\nTl;Dr: this app is so different from all the other self-help apps. It’s so intuitive with different and very helpful ways to track my progress related to different mental issues and life experiences. Love, love, LOVE the conversation and insights features! Looking forward to seeing new conversation topics that continue to be added. Thank you for making such a wonderful app! It’s helped me so much already!,I struggle with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Postpartum Anxiety and this app has been a great tool to add to my kit of coping mechanisms and growth exercises.,I don’t understand why it’s advertised as free when only 1 thing is and something minimal, a “mood tracker.” Every single article, audio, video, etc is locked. Don’t waste you time, it’s ridiculous.,Please bring the old version back, this new version of Youper has good intentions but it isn\\'t as effective.,It has great insights into things and is a nice little therapist in your pocket.,With each new update less and less becomes free. Now I can’t even find the personality tracker in the app. This app was very helpful for me to track my moods now it is useless unless I want to pay.,You changed the entire platform. None of this is helpful anymore. I’m officially going to stop telling people to use this app. Super disappointed.,Perfect app if you have anxiety or battle with panic attacks. It’s relaxing and helpful and understands.,It doesn’t load.\\nIt costs WAY too much.\\nIt’s too crazy and changes too much.\\n\\nGo to Sanvello, everyone! It’s what Youper used to be before they changed everything!!,this app would be good to help me with my problems and make me feel bette did i didn’t have to pay to use literally everything it says i need to get better, i don’t have a credit card or very much money in general and i’m also very depressed, i would like to be helped and feel better but i cannot pay to use everything on here,Youper is a great app. When it comes to finding a journaling app to help you make note of/ be present with your emotions Youper is the frontrunner. The combo of emotional journaling and various meditation options is such a strong one. Youper really helped me get through some hard times, and though I use it less now, it still holds a dear place in my emotional life.\\n\\nThat being said... I’m not sure I like where the app is heading. Every day a new feature is added- theyve make the conversation more complex, they try to make it more engaging by adding pictures/new visual aspects, there is now a home page. What I loved about Youper was how simple it was— it’s simply doing too much these days. For instance, when you used to log on it would just take you straight to some emotional journaling which was nice and predictable. Logging on today I was greeted with a banner reading “Im happy to see you again. Can I help improve your anxiety?”. If I hadn\\'t been feeling anxious before...I definitely was feeling a little anxious after reading that. I think the simplicity of Youper is what made it feel accessible and dependable. These days, opening up Youper is a little bit of a jarring experience. The constant updates to the app produce the same effect as  a therapist changing offices every day— it impedes the process. The conversation is growing increasingly halting, garbled, and incomprehensible. It saddens me!\\n\\nI probably wont get rid of Youper any time soon. There is no other app that does what it does. But it’s changing and changing fast. The Youper I suggest to my friends now is not the Youper that helped me and that’s a weird feeling. If any developers read this... don’t be afraid of the simplicity!,Love this app for the meditation options and the relax to sleep sounds. They are the best.,It’s really helpful to get thoughts out,Very helpful app ! Just be opened minded and honest !,Love this app! Very rewarding to have,I hate the new cookie-cutter therapy version. Not helpful. Go back to how it used to just ask you how you\\'re doing.,Another review had said Thai app was entirely free and help them a lot, I open the app, sign in and BAM! A subscription plan?,Love this app! Really helpful to track moods.,What’s the point of making the app free if ur gonna just have everything locked in the app?,this used to be my favorite mental health app. i would use it everyday til this new update. now it looks so bad, hard to use, slow, and glitches every time!! 😞,I refuse to use this app until they add free options.,I really miss the old Youper.,This app is great,was good until you had to pay smh,The top review raves about how helpful this app was and the importance of it being free. It is not free.,nothing is free except for a personality test. u can find the exact test online.,why do i have to pay to feel happy i hate you,Like many other long time users, I am very frustrated and massively disappointed with V.9. \\n\\nThe developers should be ashamed at releasing such a defective and bug riddled product. \\n\\nThe tabs are very SLOW to load. \\n\\nWorst of all, going to INSIGHTS  tab (either directly or automatically after journaling) FREEZES the app. As such, I am completely UNABLE to view any of my 3+ years worth of sessions into the app Or view my mood tracker Or change the settings. \\n\\nI am abhor that the first thing the app does is to suggest what to work on, such as: “Shall we work on your depression?” Or (especially before bed) “Can I suggest a productivity boosting activity?”  I need this feature removed because it has never been helpful and often causes more DISTRESS. \\n\\nThere are way too many options. It is a visual cluttered mess.  I don’t like the pictures. It bothers my OCD and makes the app way more difficult to use.\\n\\nThere are some days that I won’t use Youper because I know it’s going to cause me more distress because of the horrible user interface and broken features. \\n\\nIf the developers choose to respond to my review, please do not give me any canned answers. I doubt consumer feedback said to have a million options, including the kitchen sink. \\n\\nPlease don’t patronize me by stating that change can be difficult. The biggest complaint from everyone is that the app changes the interface way too often. \\n\\nPlease address the serious problems of features NOT WORKING. \\n\\nSTOP adding useless features in order to justify charging for this app. \\n\\nPlease clean up the user interface so that it is streamlined and easy to use.\\n\\nPlease take a lot more time to make sure the app works properly. Please use BETA testing instead of throwing out a new version and making everyone guinea pigs.,:),I have an android phone and this app is not in the android store. This app has been very very helpful but I can only use it on my iPad. If I am out and about I don’t often carry around my tablet. I would really appreciate the ability to utilize this amazing app on my phone.,Make the \"how are you feeling\" screen the default, first screen you see again. I just logged into youper to try and export my data, and then stop using youper all together: you started as a mood check in app, but now that\\'s buried on the homescreen, and when you made that change, performance *dropped like a stone*! It now takes 10x add long to even see the results of the mood check. These problems exist on both Android and iPad, and they make youper just annoying enough to make me not use it.,I’d been using Youper for over a year on my android phone, mostly for the mood tracking feature. I’ve now migrated to an iPhone and this version of the app doesn’t even seem to have this feature, or if it does it’s very well hidden. All I see are courses or meditations or whatever they are, and health monitoring. I see my old mood entries but no way to make new ones. Am I just missing something or have things changed?\\n\\nEdit: I finally found the mood journaling function: it’s buried within the “talk” section that includes specific targeted therapy sessions I guess? Haven’t used them yet but I think it’s silly I had to scroll through them just to find what used to be the whole point of this app for me. Luckily I was able to “favorite” the “I’m feeling” function for easier access next time so the utility of this app has been mostly restored for me. \\n\\nI’d still really like to see clickable calendar entries and bipolar screening. I’m sure these updates were made with specific user feedback in mind but they seem awkward to me and definitely would not have been my choice.,$14.99 a month seriously?! I have post partum depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. Trying to force users to pay a to. If money ($400 for life?! Are you kidding?) it’s sickening. There is little to nothing you can do on this app for free. Mental health should be affordable, like $5 for a lifetime.  Waste of time. Deleting the app after this review.,I purchased this app because I loved their meditations in sleep cycle. After sleep cycle removed them, I was excited to access more of the meditations that I’d come to enjoy so much. Unfortunately, this app doesn’t have the same quality meditations as they produced for sleep cycle. Also, for me at least, I can never get the app to work when I lock my screen. It just stops playing. Since I use it for sleep, this is annoying both because of the phone light and because it’ll auto lock anyways. I wanted to love this app, but I think it needs a lot of improvements.,There are lots of good meditation apps available. Each one has particular strengths and weaknesses. Most have an introductory course. Petit BamBou has the best introductory courses, Basics 1-4. It exposes you to a wide range of techniques that will really help you notice things about how your mind works that you never noticed before. The weakness of Petit BamBou is that is often sounds like the guide is reading a script. It’s a good script but at times the vocal pacing sounds like the guide is just reading the words rather than spontaneously saying them. Nonetheless, the content and detail of the guidance is very good.,I had gotten progressively open to trying out the whole meditation thing. I downloaded a couple of apps and ended up feeling like a dummy, which I was, I just didn’t want to acknowledge it I guess. Petit bambou gave me the space to try toe-dipping then wading in it and eventually sneaking off to go full on swimming with backstrokes et al in it. How did I become this addicted? Lawd !,I’ve never reviewed an app before but this is making an impact in my life. I’ve tried some similar apps but did not give me the freedom to select different types - made me go through levels. Easy to use and pleasant voice. And the price is reasonable and got a quick response to a question I had.,I’ve used a handful of meditation apps in the past. None of them compare to Petite BamBou! After about a week of guided meditation, I’m calmer, more serene, with less judgement for myself and others. Can’t say enough good things about the app. & it’s various programs. Wish I’d found it years ago.,If you want a real app that make you more grateful and kind, please, try it! Stay here, now.,Quel apprentissage magnifique à la méditation grâce à l’accompagnement journalier retrouvé sur Petit Bambou. MERCI'"

       "['I\\'m not really sure how I feel about this app. While it does ask you questions/give you prompts to get you talking about things, sometimes the questions are weird. I had one this morning, somewhere along the lines of \"what are you then, a mere body? a ration being.\" And I\\'m staring at my screen like how do I even answer this if I don\\'t understand the question? There\\'s other ones that are similar and because I don\\'t understand what it\\'s asking me to write, sometimes I\\'ll just put \"lol\" so I can move to the next page. Then when you\\'re done with your questions it will ask if you feel better and mostly my answer has been no because the questions it gave me were weird. You can pick what questions you\\'d like to be asked everyday but none of them really jump out to me as something I\\'d want to answer daily besides the one sentence summary of your day but even that is whatever. I do like that it tracks your mood, would be cool to have another tracker for what is causing your mood instead of the sad to happy face scale. The quotes are cool too. I\\'ve been using the app for about 2 weeks now and I feel like maybe twice out of the 14 days, it\\'s actually asked me something relevant. More often than not, I\\'m using the blank page entries instead but I could just write those in my actual journal. Perhaps this app isn\\'t for me, but it seems to work for people.',\n",
       " 'I downloaded this app last week and it’s been on my home page since then. I’ve only started using this app a few days ago and OMG😳 This app is so beautiful. I’m only writing a review just so I can ask if you guys can put a password for the journal part because my mom looks through my phone and I don’t want her to read the things I write in there💀 Anyways, I do actually really love this app and its perfect from the bottom of those codes and to the top of the icon. It’s iconic honestly. Not to forget the fact that it’s been lifting burdens and weights off of my back when I type everything in details. It’s like a friend that I’ve always wanted, which is sad because none of my real (alive) friends are there for me and asks me how I am like how stoic is\\U0001f972 Ever since the app asked me the first question, I’ve poured allllll of the things I wanted to say and in details too. I- this app is like that one friend that you have that’s always there for you no matter what and genuinely cares for you so deeply and that you’re comfortable being around them even though you’ve only met last week. yknow? this app is my twin flame.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely incredible. The focus breathing, the journaling, and the adaptability to each user. I have never seen such an app before. I have downloaded over 20 journaling apps, but I eventually always delete the app because I forget to journal because the app doesn’t help me. Now, this journaling app is incredible. I write 3-5 times a day and use its focus breathing exercises so much. This is the only app I want to actually support with money even though I am a stingy person.\\n\\n——\\n\\nUpdate: I do dislike the new feature where it asks you to think negatively to become grateful without being able to decline like last update. For those who are suffering depression, anxiety, and other mental issues, this is a big black hole that one can go into. I plead the developers to lock this feature away by being able to decline before the app asks you that question.',\n",

What I’m here to treat: Bipolar Disorder 1, ADD, Anxiety and Relationship problems.\\n\\nWhy I have failed with past apps and what this one gets right\\n\\n1) Clutter/Non-optimal design\\n\\nDue to my extreme sensitivity and need for minimalism, other apps with their colors and complex menus were usually too much.\\n\\nThis one is white one black. Perfect.\\nJournal history view is scroll-only with effective use of emoji to efficiently encode the information. Perfect.\\n\\n2) Need multiple apps\\n\\nBy way of illustration, prior to finding this app, I was using and paying for multiple apps featuring breathing exercises and CBT, to name a couple. A dedicated breathing exercise app may still be desirable for you, but if you’re easily overwhelmed such that the prospect of needing multiple apps will increase your chances of failure, know that this app contains breathing exercises and guided meditations alongside the best-in-class CBT, in my opinion.  Perfect.\\n\\n3) Daily commitment feels to complicated or involved.\\n\\nMany apps make me dizzy with what they want me to do to get better.  This one asks me to select a minimal drawing of a mouth to indicate my mood, quotes a stoic philosopher to inspire me and then gives me the option of what I want to do from there, while first gently encouraging me to journal by prompting a conversation.  Perfect.',\n",
       " 'I’ve written a couple app reviews for this app before, but I just want to put in that after using it for about three months now, I must say that stoic is quite a wonderful app! It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.',\n",
       " 'I feel a deep debt of gratitude to the makers of this app. I feel as if I’ve been searching for just the right journaling app and this one feels like coming home to the one made just for me. I am remembering back to the time around eleven years ago when I was jumping around between different Buddhist groups trying to find where I fit in before finally feeling at home with a Zen/Ch’an Buddhist group in Colorado. Anyways, to get back on the toping of Journaling. As I’ve been exploring my inner self through meditative practices, I’ve found journaling more and more useful. I’ve also discovered practices such as Stoicism that have been very helpful too. This app seems to combine  meditative breathing exercises, with Zen and Stoic philosophy and also to be great at guiding the individual to emotional well being. Thanks for making such a great app!',\n",
       " 'I’ve tried a lot of apps like Stoic. and it’s unquestionably the best, and the only one I’ve consistently stuck with. It’s simple but comprehensive and powerful. I love it, and use the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch versions daily to very positive effect.\\n\\nMy only critique is that sometimes the morning and evening question prompts will include questions that are very similar (“how do you plan to spend the rest of today?”, “what do you plan to do today?” in the morning) and/or outright repeat questions (often “what made you smile today?” in the evening). I suspect that I could avoid this by selecting/customizing my questions, but I like the sometimes unique questions that pop up and worry that if I don’t let the app decide, my experience with that feature of the app will stagnate. However, it is sometimes disruptive to the flow to have the same or similar question come up again.',\n",

None of the many CBT and other self-help apps was successfully filling that void. \\n\\nstoic helps me to find peace by way of a variety of tools including journaling, breathing exercises, walking meditations and other thoughtful guidance. Indeed, all common techniques, but the particular approach taken by stoic, with its clean user interface and striking graphical design, all resonated so quickly and completely within me that I paid for lifetime premium access almost immediately upon installing it.   \\n\\nMay this app be as helpful to you as it is for me.',\n",

One downside to a typical journal is that I always have to rely on myself to create prompts and ask myself questions. I downloaded Stoic Journal because I’m somewhat familiar with the stoic ideaology and believe in the power it can hold. \\n\\nI have been using this journal (almost daily) for just over 2 weeks now and I am loving it. It is simple to use, combines meditation and breathing exercises into my daily reflection routine and creates the prompts for me so I’m not limited to only reflecting on what I think is important. 10/10 I love this app, very well made and does what it is supposed to.',\n",
       " '(Note: I have the premium version) I honestly love this app. As someone who had ADHD and has trouble keeping up with everyday life, this app is a good way to sit down for a second every morning and evening and think about my day. I have the questions “What are your goals for today?” And “what do you plan to do today?” asked every morning and it really helps me organize my thoughts. One suggestion I would have is the ability to turn off certain questions. Some of them I don’t understand therefore it is not helpful.

The designs and the actual usefulness of the app is very well balanced. I also have to appreciate that the app can also be customized and personalized a lot, like chaning the app icon to changing the kind of quotes you’d get, as well! \\n\\nThere is one problem though. For students like me, I think it would be very nice if you’d add an option for students like when the app asks “What is your goal?” we could answer something like\\n “📖School” and “📚Projects”. Along with that, I’d also like to ask if you can add a bit more options for the “How did you feel today?” question.\\n\\nThe app is still very nice even without these suggestions.

This app is really great because it just it’s like a therapist I’m telling you that now it’s like a therapist. I really suggest it but one thing it could have is a passcode maybe. I have four siblings and they might just want to annoy me like all Brothers and sisters do.

I’m a strong believer of thoughts become things and this app is completely counterproductive of what I was looking for. I tried it for a few weeks but too many examples of negative continued to arise. It is also completely black and white, pretty dark and depressing just aesthetically as well.

Would be nice to have a more dedicated journal with calendar and tags to easily go back to what I have written or felt before. \\n\\n2. More stoicism content, like articles, podcasts, reflections, etc. \\n\\n3. More quotes by modern stoics.

And the daily shine always feels tailored to me, like they know exactly what I need to hear that day. And I love the encouragement to reflect and jot down a few notes, which I like looking back on. I just love this app so much!!! \\n\\n(If a developer is reading this, I do have two minor requests.

My only suggestion for the creators is to get some content regarding frustration with one’s health and specifically loving oneself when it feels like your body or your mental health are working against you. I am disabled and could see myself making content like this for my clients because it’s difficult to find elsewhere, but I would love even more for it to be on this app so I can do them for myself (it’s more difficult to be kind to oneself than others in my experience). Overall the app is wonderful and absolutely worth the subscription fee even though I don’t use it every day. Please keep up the great work.',\n",
       " 'I’ve tried many meditation apps and podcasts before, but I’ve never found something as unique as The Shine App.\\n\\nThe app is so intuitively created, and well written so that you truly have a self-care journey. Special mentions to the weekly intentions that they let you set, so that recommended content is shown to fit your chosen affirmation!\\n\\nThe Shine App also excels with it’s guided structure. Every morning they prompt you with an exceptional guided meditation, a reflection, written takeaways, recommended articles, and then 2 quick questions to note down your gratitude. It has introduced the perfect morning routine!\\n\\nThe meditations are extremely well edited, with high quality audio and soothing tones! I have to give a shout-out to Mel Chanté, her daily meditations are well written and amazingly delivered.\\n\\nLastly, I have to applaud the fact that the app is created by two women of color— this is well reflected in the content created. As the majority of the meditation speakers are of color! Not to mention, many meditations touch on racial healing and wellness. \\n\\nAs a WOC who meditates, much of the podcasts I listen to are mostly led by white women, so it is nice to see my values and identity represented at Shine. \\n\\nBest. App. Ever.\\n\\nWill continued to support as much as possible. Thank you to everyone who helped created this! ✨',\n",
       " 'I use to love Shine.... I used it every single day. You know, shine use to be a beautiful app that helped me so much with my anxiety and depression. I use to be able to listen to new voices and people helping me every day. I use to connect with them on social media. Tracking my mood. Listening to meditations and enjoying daily shines, sleep help, so much and I go into a slump for some months to come back to find out all I can do I pretty much check in. You have to pay to have access to more than 90% of the app now. Banking off people on a app that cost not only significanty less not even a year ago, but yeah didn\\'t cost to track moods... Like come on. Most people can\\'t even afford health care and you\\'ve turned Shine into one of \"THOSE\" apps. I guess I\\'ll find an alternative to get back into shape and help me with my anxiety. Youper now offers the best help, along with \"insight timer\". Over 90k free meditations free. Smh. It\\'s so unethical and sad what this app has changed into. So so much different. I never leave all reviews or have to delete apps I love but this will be it. :(',\n",
       " 'This app has been a mind saver. Mental health has always been a struggle for me. I’ve had much trauma in my life, so have always read and been immersed in the practices of mindfulness and resilience. I needed something to go along with the therapy I was doing, and wasn’t finding anything that I could solely rely on. The Shine app served it all! As a POC it was refreshing to find a community here of POC’s sharing their wisdom. It’s so rare to see POC’s in this industry. Knowing that they were POC gave me an added layer of comfort and relatability which has definitely been a refreshingly different experience. I started the app on free service for a few weeks to really learn if it was for me. I’ve just subscribed to the paid today, absolutely no regrets and continue to look forward to the progress I can learn here. Thank you Shine App!',\n",
       " \"I love the Shine app. I used to use Headspace but I’ve found this app to be more personal and helpful. Compared to Shine, headspace is sterile, un-interactive, and less diverse. The subscription is totally worth it. \\nRoom for improvement: the app doesn’t work well with Sign In With Apple so I had to switch to an email for a smoother experience. I’m my experience, the start-up screen flashes once or twice which isn't a big deal but makes the app feel a bit less polished. Lastly, I would love to have a dark mode. I use the app at night a lot and the white background is super bright. Overall, amazing app and I would recommend to anyone looking for mindfulness and less worries in their daily life. This app is a great addition to my ‘toolkit’.\",\n",
       " \"I've really been enjoying taking little breaks here and there with the meditative sessions curated to my weekly goals and just looking through the library for what I want to work on in that particular moment: calming my anxiety, staying motivated, or taking a moment to be grateful. \\n\\nI love that there's a range of shorter to longer sessions for any occasion or mood. An improvement I'd like is for the audio to keep playing even after my screen locks. Otherwise if I fall asleep to a relaxation session, my phone will just stay in the app all night until it dies which isn't great when I use my phone for an alarm.\",\n",

So i’ll have 4 or 5 copies of the same “my gratitude” information, for example. Since I cannot erase them after the fact, I’m  stuck with all of it. Irritating.

The primary reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five stars Hass to do with the accessibility with voiceover. Voiceover is an accessibility service that changes how the device works to help blind and visually impaired people like me use the touchscreen. In order for voiceover to work well, the app and the interface Hass to be programmed right. Don't get me wrong, because I do think this is one of the most accessible apps for mood out there, but it is lacking a couple of things with voiceover accessibility. For example, when I try to customize the days for a reminder, voiceover does not give me any indication of which days are checked off. For the days that are checked off for the reminders, why not have voiceover say something like M selected or M checked? That would give blind and visually impaired users an indication that Monday is checked off. Otherwise, everything else about this app is great. If it wasn't for the voiceover accessibility problem, then I would give this five stars.\",\n",

Anytime I have distorted thinking, I’ll go in the app and write out why I was feeling the way I was, or at least try to figure out why I was feeling like I was and try to work through it so I can try to rewire the way my brain acts I’m certain situations.

       " 'I’ve used slumber for almost a year. Some of the narrators I like better than other, which is why being able to search by narrator is handy. They choice of stories is great, short stories to narratives that are a couple hours long. You can also learn something while listening, they have stories to take you to other countries or teach you about history, and some are just for fun. The sounds relaxing music is nice too but I still prefer to listen to the stories, with soft music in the background. There are even children’s stories for parent who need something to help their little ones fall asleep. Less expensive than other apps and I kinda of prefer not having “celebrity” voices which make me start thinking about their movies or something instead of focusing on the story.',\n",
       " 'Slumber has a lot of the typical travel log type stories, some badly written formulaic story-like offerings, relaxation type meditations and these may be fine for many people to fall asleep. They also have a few of my favorites: wonderful voices reading very well written material. Some of these include The Jungle Book, Sherlock Holmes, The Wizard of Oz, etc. One of my very favorite readers, Abby Offer (sp? Sorry Abbie?) is found here but I wish she read better material. The guy who reads about the Norse gods, and the French Whisperer along with several others are excellent. If you want these readers, Slumber is a good second app to the best one, which eclipses them all with hundreds of thousands of free meditations and a sleep section far larger than any other entire app: Insight Timer. Plus for less than many apps you can go to Premium to support the site!',\n",
       " 'I’m a psychiatrist and recommend this app to patients with sleep trouble regularly. I myself have been using it for a couple of years now and have listened to over 700 sessions so far and continue to love how it’s developed over time. I now have a nursing newborn and this program is a lifesaver when trying to get back to sleep after a night waking. The premium subscription has been worth it for the variety offered and the regularly new content. The customer service has been great. I can’t say enough positive about Slumber. It has definitely changed the sleep game for me. I highly recommend using sleep headphones with it. Happy sleeping!',\n",
       " 'I have a special needs child who has difficulty falling asleep. Slumber has changed all that, and there is less ‘drama’ at bedtime, due to the variety of stories and how well the stories are presented. New stories are added on a regular basis, so we don’t have to keep cycling through the same ones.\\n   One thing I’d like to see added is a way to know which new stories were recently added, such as a counter showing how many times the given story was selected / played, by the individual user. This would also help determine which stories may be favorites or less favorite. Ordering options by most frequently played vs least played would be very helpful.',\n",
       " \"I've been using this app without a subscription for months and I LOVE it. I can only listen to the free stories/sounds, which rotate every once in a while. \\n\\nThere are so many types of sleep stories to choose from. They vary from adventures, to travel, to boring stuff like bird migration (honestly my fave) and different voices tell each story. \\n\\nYou can add background noises such as a calming music, running river, crickets chirping, fire crackling, a ceiling fan, and a few others. It gets even cooler because you can adjust the volume of each sound individually! For example, I like my sleep story to have low music, fire crackling and river flowing in the background. \\n\\nYou can set the story to play once, repeat twice, or infinity times. I like to set it for 2x just in case it takes me a while to fall asleep. The app also has an optional bedtime reminder notification. \\n\\nDefinitely no need for subscription (use the FREE stories!) although I may invest in a subscription considering I use the app every night for bed.\",\n",
       " 'I hate to ding this app. I love Abbe and Thomas and Nadine and all the British storytellers. I almost always fall asleep to the stories within 15 minutes or so. The trick is to try to stay awake, and you’ll fall asleep. It it turns out, however, that there’s also a podcast that has almost all the same stuff, and more, at least the stories.  So I feel kind of silly having paid for this. I don’t really need the soothing music as there are hundreds of those on streaming services. The podcast is called get sleepy. It’s free, and stories go on there before they hit here. Watch, I bet Mythology of the Moon by Abbe Offer will be next in line on this paid app. I already listened to it for free though.',\n",
       " 'I’m shocked at how much this app really helps me. My mind goes into overdrive starting at 10pm and my thoughts make it nearly impossible to fall asleep naturally. I thought that hearing voices while trying to fall asleep would not work—but it does. The stories are great because I dont like typical meditations that force me to focus on my body, breath, etc. because I want to GET OUT of my achey body. It really does help to take my mind off of the anxiety of trying to fall asleep. Something about the intimacy and tenderness of the voices feels primal—like going back to being a child and having a parent help you off to sleep.',\n",
       " 'Has helped me fall asleep, highly recommend. Calm has lots of different things, whereas slumber focuses more on just sleep stories - a relaxing narrator telling a relaxing story. These are not only fiction “stories” - my favorite are the science or history based ones - for example, teaching you about prehistoric structures. My favorite narrators are “the French whisperer” and Abbe Opher.\\n\\nMy only concern is that I am moving through them faster than new ones are being added - particularly non-fiction. We will see if I’m still using in a few months or if I’ve gone through all the non-fiction.',\n",
       " 'I been able to sleep now that I been using slumber but on the nights that the regular stories I use don’t work and I am still up for hours not being able to sleep (and I feel like I’m not the only one) I think there should be a section of sounds and stories for those kind of nights. Like for example a story about racing or about fishing to help keep parts of the mind at ease that are hard to stop from racing. \\n\\nAlso a little bug I think slumber hasn’t been tracking the sessions I do it only says I’ve done 11 when I’ve done way over 60 by now.',\n",
       " 'I have had this app for several years now to help me sleep and I mostly love it. The large choice of sleep meditations, stories and soundscapes cover most of my sleep assistance needs. I LOVE the custom controls over the background sounds. — Two improvements I would suggest: 1) a more ethnically diverse offering of narrators (no black voices, you folks need to change this now) 2) I would like more control over the music associated with the narrative. I LOVE the piano music but often find the track I choose has a synth drone and I cannot change it. Overall, it is an excellent app.',\n",
       " 'After we read books, we put on Friendly Dog for our daughters (4 & 2) to listen while they fall asleep. It encourages them to stay in bed, all parents know s struggle.  We tell them they can come out of their room if they are still awake when friendly dog ends (we set it to loop 2x 🤫) but 95% of the time they fall asleep before it ends. \\n\\nWhen I had issues with the app one night, in desperation I pinged their support center and their team helped me sort it out immediately so we could have a peaceful bedtime. Brilliant service!',\n",
       " '**UPDATE: I wrote the review below when Slumber was new and free. Then, they changed it to paid. They also changed narrators and some aren’t as good. I quit using it for quite awhile but was desperate recently and tried it again. They added more free stories again and I am again using it more. Now, I don’t feel like they ripped away my slumber I am considering a paid subscription. \\n\\nI am so hooked on Slumber. I need it to fall asleep BUT I don’t need sleep aides or supplements any more. I have tried all the other sleep story and/or music apps and can say without hesitation Slumber is hands down THE BEST. Thank you for this app.',\n",
       " 'Thank you for making great improvements. I’m sure it’s not easy fixing bugs to constantly stay ahead, but appreciate all you do to help me sleep! Love the stories and meditation and ability to select background ambiance, whether nature or music. The story tellers are all wonderful to fall asleep to. I only wish we could choose the background music. There is one particular background music track that for whatever reason, is sad and frightening. I don’t know how or if it can be changed. Keep the great stories coming. 🙂',\n",
       " 'I had trouble sleeping due to some trauma that resulted in PTSD. My therapist recommended that I try a sleep app and specifically recommended slumber. I was skeptical. Even now when I play slumber I think, “this is not going to work” and that is the last thing I remember because I fall asleep and sleep through the night. I find that I like falling asleep to a female voice more than a male voice. This app is my favorite because I am able to sleep well and fall sleep within 20 minutes.',\n",
       " 'I would give them a five star rating just the problem is they locked two of my favorite ones and I’m not gonna spend money on this app so that’s why I give them a three out of five star rating I recommend it if you’re willing to spend money on the app if not all the good stories are locked so I would not get it. But some of their other stories that aren’t locked help me fall asleep so I kind a need this app you may give it a five star rating because you’re willing to spend money on it I am not and I don’t want to.',\n",
       " 'I’ve never heard the story of the white cat before.  I have been staying awake, not being able to fall asleep because my mind keeps racing.  I decided to try a sleep story because I figured it would help me focus on one thing,  be simple and mindless.  I’ve tried it twice and I still couldn’t tell you what the story is about because I have fallen asleep both times.  I’m excited to go to bed now curious if I will ever finish the story.  I hope not!',\n",
       " 'When trying to fall asleep after an exhausting day, I’ve struggled to quiet the seemingly never ending thoughts that rotate through my mind. With Slumber, I can choose, depending on my mood, which sleep story or meditation best reflects what I may need that night. It has helped me more than I can say! \\nIn my opinion this app is the best and I have tried many of them, including Calm. If your inner-child is in need of some love, give this a try!',\n",
       " 'An amazing app.  I have been using this for two months now.  Only once did I ever make it to the end of a story.  Usually I fall asleep during the relaxation instructions before the story even begins. If I waken later in the night and listen again, I am again able to fall asleep. I do have a preference for certain readers.  It is important to listen to several and find ones you like.  My favorite is Thomas Jones.',\n",
       " 'I started listening 3 or 4 years ago after having Difficulty sleeping due to severe anxiety. I’ve kept buying it every year after that for the entertaining stories and customization options that lull me to sleep. I often recommend it to my patients for the meditations to help with sleep, stress reduction, relieve anxiety, even self affirmations. It’s a good product that seems to continue getting better.',\n",
       " 'Lots of calming background music and sounds to aid in getting to sleep, as well as good narrators to tell a good story or educate me about an historical event or person.  I also appreciate the numerous relaxation and meditation techniques instructions. Just a great place that I can count on to help me focus on relaxing and escaping to a peaceful place in my mind whether I’m at home or traveling on a plane and staying in hotels on the other side of the country.  Well worth the price :).',\n",
       " 'Slumber is an amazing app and the stories put me to sleep almost instantly. You can my background noises and those help a lot too. The only reason it’s not five star is because I can only do three or four stories because I must pay for the others. I understand that’s their way of getting money, but I just wish we had another story or two that was free. I recommend slumber! It’s very good at putting you to sleep fast and peacefully.',\n",
       " 'Ever since I got Slumber (May 2020) I have been listening to their meditations every day. I especially love the one titled \\n“Clouds at Sunset”. I always had trouble sleeping before, but now I never have to worry. The only thing I don’t like is that I have to pay for the other meditations, and it’s not such a big problem but I personally think that all the meditations should be free. So if you are a person who can’t fall asleep at night, I suggest to you to get Slumber.',\n",
       " 'Good app now. It was terrible for awhile. Lots of selection although for me the history is the best for putting me to sleep. I would however love to rate each episode or selection separately as they vary wildly. Some are great for kids others for history last vets or true meditations. In the setting there is a “rate episode” option but I can never find the ability to do so. Please develop more history options.',\n",

Good job you guys... for $4 a month I’m finally falling asleep!',\n",

I definitely would recommend this to anyone who has trouble sleeping.',\n",
       " 'The reason I rated this a 4 star instead of a five star, is because when I listen to these sleep stories I prefer a female voice, ( because it’s more soothing to me ) but with every sleep story there is only either a male or female narrator option. I think it would be better if you could have a female or a male option for each sleep story. Otherwise, amazing app!!!',\n",

My all time favorite was the Birds of Yosemite. Great narrator, beautiful musings about nature, and it is now locked. Previously permanent free stories should be grandfathered in, even if new free ones since the change are on a rotating basis (idk if they are but i cant think of why else they would lock old free ones). Dreams of Grasmere is also locked now and that one was also pretty successful at helping me sleep. Sidenote, I just checked the premium price and its now $40/yr, which is not as ridiculous a price as it was before\\n\\n- - -\\nThis app is fantastic, the stories help my brain focus on the narrative rather than a bunch of inner chaotic thoughts, which helps me fall asleep. I especially love The Birds of Yosemite, which seems to be a reading of an actual published journal of some sort. And it has such rich and beautiful descriptions and the narrator does a wonderful job. The optional sound effects & mixing are also very subtle & pleasant. HOWEVER I have to knock my review down a whole two stars because there is such a small handful of free episodes. Only someone with a superfluous amount of spending money would pay $10/mo for a single sleep app, as much as it may help their (my) chronic insomnia. I would love to fall asleep to more nature journals, or more simple stories like The Cats Journey, but there has not been a single new free episode in the months I’ve had this app. And the problem with listening to the same stories over and over is that your brain starts to tune them out because they are familiar, and instead becomes overrun with thoughts once again and stays awake. If the devs would consider at least releasing ONE new free story for every 5 or 10 new locked stories (new locked stories get released at an impressive rate), I would easily give the app 5 stars.',\n",

Hard for me to explain but If there were soft instrumental music and / or a selection of nature noises w/ music to add to keep playing after the story, I would have renewed.

       " 'I discovered Headspace on Netflix. My life is a series of invitations to succumb to fear. My husband is a practicing psychologist who is on peritoneal dialysis for 10 hours every night and works remotely with patients for about 10 hours every day without complaint. We have been waiting for a kidney for two years. I am optimistic by nature but even if this was the only focus for concern it would be a lot. Unhelpfully, the list goes on with equivalent issues. I can’t work; I need to be on call because I am the go-to for support. I occupy my mind and time writing a book and renovating every room of our home one at a time amidst being available for nine blended (mostly grown) children and 5 grandkids, many of whom have special needs. I am busy but isolated like so many due to covid-19. Trying the Headspace series felt like meeting air; filling the natural and effortless need to breathe. It has provided me with a new lens through which to focus on challenges and see potential. I incorporate it into my waking routine at dawn and it positions me for whatever happens throughout the day, and differentiates a space that is my own. I turn 61 this month and for maybe the first time in a while, life feels lighter and brighter. It’s not about what you fear or can’t control or even the fact of fear. It’s about the lens through which you interpret your fears or challenges and making them your strengths and allies. Thank you Andy :-)',\n",
       " 'You won’t regret buying a Headspace subscription. I often joke with people that Headspace is the one thing I would want to take with me to a desert island. If I were to cancel all of my subscriptions today, Headspace is the one exception I would make. I’m a high school English teacher, and our administration put together a month-long mindfulness education program for our students shortly after I subscribed. I had already raved to many of them about the app and the benefits of taking a couple of minutes out of their day to sit and be present. Lo and behold, Andy pops up on the next slide as our Ted Talk speaker of the day! On a more serious note, I suffer from debilitating chronic pain. I’m currently on long-term disability and a leave of absence from the classroom. Mindfulness, and the courses on managing pain, have been a tremendous help in my journey. Not only that, but I struggle with insomnia. My favorite part of Headspace, because of my (admittedly) vivid imagination, are the sleepcasts. I love falling asleep to Rainday Antiques. I can’t imagine doing anything but that ever again. I have learned to manage stress and anxiety in a way that I had never thought was possible. I have meditated in the waiting room of The Cleveland Clinic before my appointments. I once laughed at the idea of mindfulness and meditation. Now it’s an integral part of my life. It’s part of my journey, and I think everyone could benefit from it.',\n",
       " 'This app has given me tools to deal with constant change. This past year, I’ve needed to pivot every day to face some new challenge outside as an essential worker, and at home in isolation with my partner. The tools I Iearned to use to be present in the moment and to accept change has benefited my partner and colleagues at work as much as my own peace of mind. I have very little control over my environment, but I can see my reaction, accept the emotions that rise up, and move on instead of getting lost or bound by them.\\nThis app has also benefited me by helping me get through insomnia. Sometimes it helps me get to sleep in the first place. Mostly it gives me tools to use to calm my mind and body when I wake up in the night buffeted by anxiety or lingering frustration from the day. \\nLastly, this app has given me a language to express the emotional upheaval and troubling questions that I used to just call anxiety. Naming what makes me feel upset has brought clarity to what can feel like a tempest at the time and allow me to look at my thoughts or, rather, face them. After acknowledging them, I can let them go. Sometimes I’m better at that than at other times. \\nRegular exercise strengthens my focus, my ability to pivot and refocus, and builds roads of calm and quiet that the brain finds easier to fall into and travel due to constant use.',\n",

It’s an excellent way for me to relax. Calm my mind. Stop thinking about myself. And to recover in the moment. Hopefully in time this will help me heal, as previously I’ve just been getting worse and worse without any therapy since my therapist’s practice permanently shutdown from COVID. This has been a great help and is something I can just pull out of my pocket and sit in my bedroom for a bit to calm down. Well worth the 1 year subscription price I’ve paid. Thank you! 😊🙏🏻\\n\\n*There is only one thing that I’d change. This would be for some of the workout audios. I need to walk a lot for a heart condition I have (which is a big cause of my health anxiety), and I’d love to see the audios for walks and runs to be a bit longer. The longest run audio I see is 20 minutes, when recommended cardio workout lengths realistically should be at least 30 minutes. I’d really like to have an audio similar to the bedtime audios that are lengthy, have soothing talk, and tips to reduce anxiety made to be listened while walking. And if there could be a variety to choose from. Overall this would be the only change I can think of. An hour long walk audio to help calm my mind. 😁❤️',\n",

I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness and it’s helped me in the past but I’ve never been able to stick with it for more than a couple of weeks at a time. Then one day while listening to Huberman’s podcast there was a month free trial and I decided to try it since I’ve always wanted to give this app a go anyway. WELL, let me tell you...this app is changing my life. I am proud to say I am on my 33rd day streak. I can feel myself overall being more present and aware throughout the day. Now, when I start to feel anxious I almost immediately catch myself and can begin using some of the tools and practice I’ve accumulated from headspace. I do want to add though, the key word is PRACTICE. Medication, like Andy says, is a skill and like any skill you must practice. By practicing enough, it does truly become second nature. I know it’s only been a month but I can already feel the difference and I am looking forward to the future. Thank you headspace team. P.S every little thing about this app is great.

I feel less stressed, calm, and feel ready for anything. It’s like a guide or tool which helps push you to be a better you. So then comes the question, is it worth it? I think so. For instance if you have ADHD or feel stressed most days (maybe because of work or school) use this. \\n\\nEverything is not sunshine and rainbows. For one, $13 to me feels somewhat pricey. Other meditation apps that I found are cheaper than what Headspace currently offers. Another thing is that it lacks free content. There’s only very little that Headspace offers and it’s not a lot. It’s almost as if your forced into paying for a subscription in order to use it. I really didn’t want to do that and I have now canceled it since I felt that it was overly priced. \\n\\nHeadspace is great and I may say that’s is better than most apps I’ve used. But I don’t like the fact that after going through the tutorial it locks most of the content Headspace offers you and forces you into a subscription that feels overly priced.

       " 'So I’ve been using headspace for quite awhile now and personally I think it’s great! But the thing is since I don’t have premium, I have to keep on repeating the same old things like the rain day antiques sleepcast I’ve heard that sleep cast so many times and now I keep getting annoyed with it. That goes the same with the other sleep stuff too like the sleep music I’ve heard “doze” so many times I wake up like every 30 minutes or so. Also goes the same with the two free wind downs. The first time I used the free wind downs I fell asleep instantly the second time after that I couldn’t sleep for ten minutes. So after that, I wanted to do a free trial for the premium but I didn’t realize I was short on money. Since most people do a free trial for like a week or so they cancel there payment the day before the payment is due. So I tried doing that but it asked for but then I realized they need to know my payment information before doing my free trial. I think it was because they don’t know if I’m gonna cancel my payment or actually do the payment. So yeah, I think this app is amazing it just needs to either lower down the price by like 3-4$ or maybe add one or two me free sleepcasts and same goes to the wind downs, and music. Thank You.',\n",
       " 'This is really helpful! The only reason I didn’t give a higher rating is because there’s a strong overlying tone of a sales pitch there. Which is unfortunate, because I think people would be able to see the value easier if there wasn’t a push for money after every meditation and for many of the things on the app people would want to explore. Kind of stalls progress of the meditation itself when you’ve just worked so hard to pull yourself back, only to be instantly asked for money right after. From a company stand point I also think it would be more beneficial to work on building value and then freely offering the option to see what monthly costs are and also show a detailed description of what’s involved with a paid membership. I know this has worked well financially for other services and I’ve seen increases in sales by simply looking at things from the customers perspective. And I feel like the customers perspective is a miss here :(\\nHowever quite and easy fix and overall this app is amazing! It not only teaches the basics of meditation, but teaches different techniques as well. This makes it good for beginners all the way to experts. I truly believe that the basis of this app is pure in intention and I can see what a help it is to many people who walk the path of life.',\n",

I travel quite a bit and I love that I’m able to pick my environment of choice to meditate. I always thought meditation meant quieting your thoughts etc... but when I learned that it was part of being mindfulness and being present in the now it helped immensely in my day to day well being. When I did the anxiety course that really helped in so many ways because I thought you could get rid of it. But learning to become aware of it and being present with it, I felt it wasn’t so much of a burden. I’ve had trouble on and off sticking to it consistently but I’m trying it again. It’s nice to be able to have it there especially when I know how much of a positive impact it has had on my life. I am a parent and it’s something I want my child to learn and partake in so she has the necessary tools through out her early years to when she is grown up. This is worth every penny to maintain a healthy mindset and wellbeing. You’ll view the world and stress differently than you did before.',\n",
       " 'I downloaded Headspace when it was free for health care workers in 2020. I was pregnant at the time and was under a lot of stress at my job. I started with the pregnancy course on the app. This was so amazing. First of all, Andy’s voice is incredibly calming. Then the pregnancy meditation helped me feel closer to baby. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and when I was less stressed, my glucose was lower. This app helped me a ton with that. Then, when I went to my 29 week check up, I had just read a work email I was very upset about. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was high. They sent me to the hospital for monitoring. While I was there I practiced the meditation I had learned and was able to get my blood pressure down so I could go home! The meditations also helped me get through labor! Now that I had my baby, I’m still using this app because it just helps me find calm in my crazy world of being and full time working mom during a pandemic. If you are at all interested in meditation, you need this app. I promise it’s worth the money. When my free subscription is over, I’m paying for it! I never write app reviews, but I just want everyone to know how great Headspace truly is.',\n",
       " 'In my abnormal psychology class we learned anxiety is not just a fight or flight response but instead can be a future oriented response. Abnormal anxiety usually is characterized by presenting when there is no real danger. Therefore when I lay down in bed to sleep and I start getting an increase heart rate, feel extremely hot and sometimes nauseous at the idea of future situations and work that I have yet to do, it’s abnormal. Even if many people experience this is is abnormal because there is no real threat just my brain over thinking future situations. Therefore on my quest to look for ways to relax my mind before bed I downloaded headspace. I usually listen to a guided meditation before bed. Followed I will set one of their sleep music for 60 minutes and lay down. I now am normally asleep before the sleep music stops. Even though in my class we talked more about biological and psychological treatments, I felt as though there might be an easier way for me to deal with this anxiety. Headspace has created a way for me to clear my head before bed allowing for more and a greater quality of sleep. I would suggest this app to anyone, not even for just sleeping. But as a way it relax.',\n",

Why can\\'t I see my today screen on the watch and start my various mediations from the watch. the watch app gets 1 star. 2. Shortcuts: on the iphone I have setup a sleep schedule. On the \"good night\" screen I am given the option to run shortcuts. Headspace offers a few shortcuts that can be called from this screen. One is the nightly \"sleepcast\". the sleepcast is supposzed to be different every night. It is different on my today screen, but the shortcut always plays the \"Rainyday Antiques\". therefore the shortcut is useless. this part of the app gets 1 star. Lastly, the philosophy behind this app is mindlessness. It is taught as a universal fix for bringing the mind to a place of ease. As such it is a religious philosophy. I think they need to be more open about this and they need to state that the point of this is to alleviate suffering.\\n\\nThis app looks like they did version 1 then stopped before finishing the details.    Shortcuts must work for this app to be fully functional',\n",
       " 'I signed up for my free trial in fall 2019, at the recommendation of a family member. I thought it was great, but wanted to shop around and see what all of the individual meditation apps had to offer, but Headspace is the clear winner. I signed up for an annual subscription (and I hardly ever do that). The general organization of the interface is great in its simplicity, because you can easily toggle between the app’s different features with the navigation on the bottom, and there’s only five options so it’s aesthetically pleasing to me. Speaking of aesthetics, the graphics shown while meditating are very uplifting, simple, and non-intimidating. I think apps like Calm that have the ability to show/do nature sounds are cool, but that feels like too many decisions as to what graphic to choose. The soft Australian accent that Andy has is very calming but feels more non-judgmental, like an old friend who’s just being your guide through the meditation. The daily video content pieces are cool, too. So far I’ve learned about how music affects the brain and about snake plants. This app leaves me feeling inspired and refreshed. 10/10. Great job, devs!',\n",

I wish they were a bit longer, but I understand it’d be hard to record a story that’s hours long. I have a couple suggestions: When a sleepcast ends, can it just skip to the next sleepcast (or at least have that be an option in settings?). Also, I can only fall asleep to male voices, so I’m very limited to a few sleepcasts.. it’d be great if all stories were recorded by both a male and a female and we could choose which we’d like to listen to. Lastly, I really would like a setting where we can skip the breathing wind-downs. If not, then at least have a trigger where when you’ve already done 1 wind-down, then the next sleepcast you listen to should automatically skip this part. It’s frustrating wanting to dive right into a new story and having to go through the same breathing session you just did. I really hope you hear my input and take it into consideration! If not, I’ll send them via email to developers. :)',\n",

Andy, or any of the two female instructors, do an awesome job in guiding you through the meditation process. There are a variety of topics: Happiness, Anxiety Management, Anger Management, and so on, which are featured as courses, ranging from 10-30 sessions, each one being as short as 10 minutes or up to 20. The teachers start each session talking about a certain aspect, a thinking pattern, that applies to the topic in question, which lasts about one to two minutes, as a means of providing a tangible mental visualization to accompany you in the session as it begins.\\n\\nAside from these courses, the app features exploring meditation fundamentals such as breathing, visualization, and so on. Q and A sessions, “Start the day” routines, this app is really, really good.

Tools that would help me open my heart and mind to new possibilities and a more peaceful and compassionate approach to myself and the world. With the gentle and insightful guidance of Andy and the other practitioners, I feel safe and supported in my efforts to face and walk through difficult times.  I am able to embrace joy and be present for myself, others and my life as it is today.   It is always going to be a daily practice, as it should be, for that is the essence of being in the moment.

Not only do they have a course for anxiety, but there are also SOS meditations that are super helpful when you’re in the middle of panic mode. Since I first got the app they have added so many new meditations, courses, and even instructors. It has grown with me as my meditation practice has grown and it is always a great day when I use the Headspace app. \\nAs far as the price it is definitely on the expensive side. I first started using the app when I was in college and was lucky to be in a financial situation where I could afford it. I know they are offering it for free to those who have been affected by the coronavirus. However, my one critique is that they should make a student version, so more people will have access to this life-changing app. \\nThank you Headspace for this amazing product!

They have courses like “dealing with anxiety” or “managing anger”, but they’re all essentially the same: “here’s some basic advice you’ll get from every therapist for 30 seconds, now let’s do 20 minutes of body scan.” I don’t feel like they really apply the meditation to the issues often enough, but the advice is decent.\\n\\nAlso, in the beginners courses they mention a lot of abstract concepts that are supposed to help you but they don’t explain them very well or reinforce them very often. So half the time I find myself thinking “Wait, what does he mean by that again and how was I supposed go about it?” \\n\\nThere are enough great meditation pointers though that it’s been super helpful to get over some hurdles I was struggling with and the voices are very relaxing.

I’ve been working on my anger, my depression, focusing on me. Being kind to me and I’m telling you this has helped me so much.

I also have grown to love the English accents and my kids say ‘when are we going to listen to Andy?’ if it’s been a couple of days. This app is a game changer!!!',\n",

I don’t know what it is about his demeanor or his voice, or if it’s how accurately he addresses (universal) challenges with learning meditation, but I am hooked.  Not only do the sessions relieve and clarify the cloudy emotions we all deal with, I’m now starting to subconsciously use techniques Andy has taught even when I’m not meditating.  I have especially found his instruction helpful as it pertains to not engaging with certain thoughts as they bubble to the surface throughout the day.  I’m better able to watch them pass by like cars in the road be chase them, or I simply turn the channel to a more neutral or happier subject.  I have never felt more centered and at peace.  Less reactive.  Happy!!',\n",

It helps with stress, eating, sleeping, and getting to know more about the mind and body, and how to feel comfortable.\\n\\nI’ve been having ALOT of stress in my life, from school, to siblings, to friends, to the sleeping disorders and the depressions. To the lost loved ones and moving houses. \\n\\nI’ve become so stressed that I become really sick. I’ve developed this thing called “Anxiety Nausea” I became so sick I thought I was dying! Headspace has helped me deal with and understand with what’s happening with my body, and I appreciate it! \\n\\nI recommend this app to ANYONE. Even if you don’t suffer from bad anxiety or any disorder, I still recommend. It helps you a lot, and you may learn something you never knew about your body before. \\n\\nFrom the help of my family and headspace, I’m recovering. To anyone going through this, or something similar, you will recover. And you’ll find people who support you. If you don’t, find a hobby! Or go out on a walk! \\n\\nAnd yeah.. maybe anxiety will never go away.. but you can help your body by knowing some solutions to help! Treat your body with the kindness and respect it deserves.\\n\\nTo anyone reading this, you will make it through!\\n\\n————————-\\nMuch Love, Ava ✨❤️',\n",
       " 'I have attempted to start a meditation routine several times over the past four years, but struggled greatly. Instead of feeling relaxed I would quickly feel panicked and found breathing difficult. When I first began meditating with Andy, I immediately tried the guided meditation for dealing with anxiety. It was so comforting to learn that my anxious tendencies resulted in overly trying to control my breath and in turn created an unhealthy pattern. I took heart knowing that if it was on his app, surely this must be something many others have faced. With his expert guidance I have learned to look forward to meditation and how it relaxes my body and mind. As I have explored the app more, I find that Andy has addressed many other hurdles I have had with meditating. I have benefited so much already and look forward to see where this path takes me.',\n",

I just dove right in and now with the help it has guided me, I can almost do it on my own. It’s something I turn to when I get stressed, angry or sad. Or even need to sleep. The videos have been so soothing and helpful in every way. It has changed the way I look at my day and helps me remember to focus. Not a day goes by where I don’t use one of the audio recordings to help me tackle and problem I’m having. Also the work outs are very subtle and easy. Best app for a stressful life. Highly recommend. I’m better at controlling my struggles now. Thank you! ❤️ I hope someone reads this because it’s a real experience and I’m so grateful it’s helped me, it may help someone else too. Try it.',\n",

Can you guys pls stick to meditation / related areas and not try to push politics, agendas and ideologies on what justice is and what is not? (A lot of the “social justice” ideas pushed on society by ultra leftists that are actually destroying the left as a valid movement (and only give more power to the right), actually result in “injustice” overall so really hope you guys are not going to be part of that (just dig in a bit deeper and dont follow the herd w/o thinking pls). Yes, it is a trend but dont try to “look good” as a company using this stuff.

I have to say tue coaches on here have call convinced me guided practice is right for me. Their voices and knowledge are much appreciated. I look forward to this practice more than I did when it was just me and silence. At first I did not believe it would be worth keeping past the free trial.

The sleep meditations have helped calm me during some restless nights or just simply help me relax for bed.  I have yet to utilize the move section of the app and I’m looking forward to exploring this more. This app helps guide you in learning this new skill that requires consistent practice.

Their lessons resonate most days which is more consistent than any other techniques Ive tried over the years. I genuinely look forward to meditation time now because it makes my day feel brighter even on days when I’m really struggling.

I'm eager to resume my practice!\\n\\nI'd love to give this app 5 stars, but it's lacking a crucial feature. It doesn't seem compatible with airplay or iPhone automation, so there's no way for me to play the soundscape through my homepod. It really tanks the utility of the feature that I can't use a speaker with the app. Automation is definitely a nice-to-have feature, but with it I could start playing the soundscape from my phone to the speaker when it's time to sleep, kind of like an inverse of an alarm clock.\",\n",

Not to discount the value of the content but in truth, for someone who may not use the app to it's full capacity daily, it just seems like a lot.

Andy and Eve’s voices are so calming and I have learned the basics of meditation through their basic package and have moved on more specific guided ones, such as appreciation, or letting go of resentment or anxiety.

My son has used the bedtime stories to get to sleep on difficult nights.I always thought of meditation as an art I wasn’t talented at.

It makes me feel calmer, happier, and more confident at dealing with my anxiety. It feels pretty essential to me just like taking vitamins, exercising, getting enough sleep, etc. It would be a great way for anyone to have a healthier lifestyle.

In that way, it can be life changing. The UX is okay; you kind of have to dig around in a not-so-intuitive way to get into other features, but some essentials are laid out plainly upon opening the app. It’s still 70USD/yr. So, a tune up in that department wouldn’t hurt. The voices are very pleasant, but I wonder if using only British accents deters a more diverse audience (i.e., people who are already a tough sell [i.e., british accents = liberal conspiracy ~ U.S.A.] but would benefit tremendously from meditation, and people who might consider using British accents in this context to be appropriation/co-opting target cultures of some kind).

I’ve been listening to “Cabin Porch” for 25 minutes and haven’t heard a peep from Darren. Tgis happens with several other sleepcasts as well. If no one is talking, shouldn’t it just be a soundscape?

Taking the time to take some time for myself has given me more awareness of my mind which benefits not only me, but the people around me. Meditation, I believe, helps the most with preventing a snowball effect of emotions by noticing the bad thoughts before it’s nearly unstoppable which could ruin a whole day or weeks without even remembering what started the poor mood.

I miss the way the app was organized and the way the “brand” was a couple years ago when they used a softer-pallet color scheme for the thumbnails. Back when the Headspace logo was an all caps font. The bold colors (especially in the sleep sections) are too saturated for my taste and seem at a discord for a company promoting stillness in the mind. I also miss the layout/menu organization that the app had back then.

The video production and design work are outstanding, as is the coaching. I do wish, however, that there was a bit more emphasis on form throughout the workouts – if I did not have previous experience with some of the exercises, I might be a bit lost as to how to do them properly and without risk of injury.

Meditation has made a difference and while there is a learning curve and a healthy dose of personal accountability involved in making it a habit; it is a worthwhile habit and headspace was my favorite (I also tried calm) place to start this journey. \\n\\nPs Idk how true this was my subscription was a gift from my mom but my therapist said some insurance companies will help cover the cost of the yearly subscription!',\n",

Due to all of this it’s hard for me to focus and even harder to remain present. I’ve had years of therapy but can honestly say that Headspace is quickly helping me overcome my restless mind, and my physical pain. It is also helping me with my insomnia. I suspect that, in time, I may not need sleeping pills anymore; my intake of pain medication has also decreased.\\nI’ve been meditating with Andy for only two weeks. I started on Netflix, then moved to the app and I can already see big improvements in my life. This is truly a lifesaver!',\n",
       " 'I have gotten this app before, but I never put the time into my schedule to actually use it and meditate with it. But recently I have the urge to mediate more and focus on my mind. It is so calming, relaxing, and peaceful. When I am stressed or just in a bad mood in general, it’s nice to take a few minutes on headspace. Sometimes after school is nice, or before studying. As a student this is a very helpful app. It’s also great to get moving! Or fall asleep to! Or even focus too! I recommend this app for everyone, all ages, and especially students in high school, middle school, and college! It’s free, unless you want the premum version. I have the free account, and it’s just as good! Highly recommended app!',\n",
       " 'I have been using headspace since 2017 and have always liked the content. It is soothing and helpful more often than not. That being said, the app has a lot more content now and it is easy to get lost in a sea of courses, videos and other details. \\n\\nFor one, it’d be nice to have some kind of goal setting based on what I am going through in life. Right now, it is hard not to get distracted by the billion colorful cards and many other auto playing videos or moving images. Sometimes, that feels so counter intuitive for a service aiming to make you feel more peaceful. Overall a very nice service but I wish they improved their interface.',\n",
       " 'I have an intense fear when it comes to falling asleep. Sleep means a new day of stress and work. But with Headspace, I’ve learned to accept these worries and workloads as opportunities rather than burdens. To take in my life one step at a time and observe my anxieties rather than try and control them. This gives me a better understanding of what is really happening. \\n\\nNot to mention, the sleepscapes help me fall asleep with stories to help keep my mind off of everything else. Wind down sessions to start off to help get you comfortable for bed, followed by soothing story telling that puts me asleep nearly instantly. I love the continuations of the sleep scapes too!

Still, their adorable animation, their daily morning Wake Up segments at the start of my days, and their Focus music when working on projects have immensely improved my daily mornings.

I became more focused, a better performer, and a better version of myself. That was back when it was just Andy and guided meditations. Having the app now is a world of different!

If you get any text or phone call during your session, then the audio stops - even on Do Not Disturb mode. You essentially just sit in silence for another 20 minutes wondering if you should break meditation and check your phone - which can be a really frustrating experience. It sometimes ruins the meditation itself because you run over your scheduled time for meditation. You don't get that gentle opening of the eyes and reflect on your feelings - instead you might end up angry that the session was ruined. \\n\\nI want to continue to support this wonderful program, but after almost 400 sessions, I am considering quiting my subscription and using a regular timer instead.

I really like that the stories all get varied so they don’t get repetitious. The volume during the sleepcasts sometimes seems to vary, so I find it’s best to keep them on low volume so that if there is an increase, it is not as disturbing. I have a preference for the sleep casts where the speaker is speaking in a low voice and slowly but that’s just my preference, other people may enjoy the sleep casts that are a little bit faster and higher pitched. In this very tough past year I don’t know what I would’ve done without Headspace’s sleep casts.',\n",

Having guided meditations takes the some of the pressure off, and I find Andy’s voice really soothing. Recently I’ve been going on guided runs and I find that it’s changed my mentality while running, which I also use as a coping mechanism for grief. If you’re like me, struggling with sadness and anxiety, wanting a break but not knowing how, this is a really great tool.',\n",

That’s where I was with my mental health and meditation when I started using this app. I used to be in a great place with my meditation practice, but years ago I just quit for no apparent reason.

Its library offers tons of great content to help guide you in your meditation practice. I especially love their Morning Wake Up videos and evening soundscapes.

Now this sounded fun.  Spent 5 minutes watching someone tell me, in order to identify a plant, look for a sticker or tag on it that says what it is. You can also type in google what features that plant has and maybe google can tell you.  😂😂😂.  It was at this point I realized that this app is for morons.

I do symmetrical things with my fingers everyday and it worry’s  my mom which I wish had a way to change.

You would be better off looking for professional CD or even podcasts.  Headspace claims to have clinical proof for it's program.  Having a background in healthcare sales I would like to see a professional overview of thier claims.  Just a simple meta-data review by a third party would be useful.  Save your money and look around, for the price of the subscription you can pay less and get much better content.

With Headspace, the practice of mediation feels accessible and fun. The service itself is 5-stars. \\n\\nThe apps, however, need refinement on some platforms, in particular iPad OS and Watch OS. The iPad forces the app to play in Portrait only, which means you have to turn your head sideways if you’re using the iPad’s Magic Keyboard. Also, videos like Mindful Earth play well in this format. \\n\\nI also find the Apple Watch app very disappointing. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but it only shows a 1 minute Breathe Mini meditation. Shouldn’t this just relay what’s available on my phone? I’d love to use the app to trigger frequently used exercises like Walk in The City or Creative Writing. \\n\\nAlso, why isn’t there a TV OS version?

The word switch is a bit harsh and has a variety of meanings that aren’t very calm. It’s really hard to understand how those words were the right choice.

So I will not be renewing the Headspace app. at the end of the current subscription period. \\n\\nTip for Headspace: Provide new sleep cast stories and get rid of that stupid whisper cast.

For over a decade I was unable to get into a regular meditation practice b/c I was striving for a blank slate of a mind and feeling like a failure when I couldn’t do it.

Thanks to Headspace I’ve meditated almost every day for two years now. Meditation led me to realize my drinking was a problem, and I am now 19 months sober.

I have been doing meditation for many years and yoga for more. But this app brought me back and guided me through the grief process and all that goes with it. My sleep is improved and I’m feeling more joy than ever. It’s worth it if you commit to using it a few times a day or at least daily. I have tried all the mindfulness apps and Headspace and Buddahfy are the very best.',\n",

The sleep music has been a godsend for drowning out my boyfriend’s snoring; and the sleep casts help me calm my mind, get tired, and fall asleep quickly. I love that some of the sleep music lasts all night that way when my roommates dogs are moving around the house it doesn’t wake me. The only recommendation I would like to give is to give a last listen to date on the sleep section!! I know it would be beneficial to me because I use it so often!',\n",

I have issues falling asleep so I got this app but it wasn’t worth it because I have to pay to use most of it. I am only 14 and I can’t pay for it. I wish that is were to be free. Instead of having to pay a ridiculous amount of money for an app like this. So don’t get this app if you don’t wanna pay for it try and use other things that are free to use or try.',\n",

I am also a teacher struggling with this Covid culture. It is heartbreaking as well.

Getting this subscription now has been perfect timing before losing my mind. \\nSUGGESTION: I wish it was easier for me to get to the courses I’ve started. It took me a couple\\nDays into the Managing Anxiety course to remember how I got to the course at all. The grey button on the landing page to “view course library” is light grey and easy to miss.

As a UX Research & Strategy professional I'd love to point product designers to Headspace as an example of great design, but it needs to address some important usability issues such as discoverability of courses and expert guidance clips. In general, the content needs a better organization strategy based on user research. The counter of hours meditated is too abstract to consider it meaningful for the user. A visual of the stats of individual progress overtime may be more valuable. I hope they bring more UX Research expertise to the core team!\",\n",

Additionally adding a dedicated Headspace app for Apple TV would be amazing for the times when I’m looking for mindfulness without the distractions.

I’ve always loved this app and it’s helped me so much for my mental health but it seems so corporate and cold to cut someone off from something so important so their treatment. Especially when some (myself included) already pay an arm and a leg to treat their mental illnesses through the American healthcare system. I’d say use what’s free while you still can.',\n",

They’re so low pressure; there’s nothing about the notes that make me feel guilty - rather, they’re just an additional benefit. I do find value in the messages. \\n\\nAnother helpful feature are the sleep sounds. The 8 hour ones are especially helpful to me overnight.

       " 'Over the holidays, I suffered emotional and spiritual trauma resulting from a severe injury to a family member who has been hospitalized, battling depression, and suffering a concussion  from a fall. I was not able to sleep for almost 3 days due to my concussion, and the mental, spiritual and physical torment has been intense. I just started using headspace for sleeping at night and working on positivity for sports injury rehab. I’m looking forward to spending as much time as I can with meditating to heal my brain, spirit, heart and muscles (self).',\n",
       " 'I’ve been going through some heavy anxiety and depression this past year. Mediation and tapping (EFT) have saved me. This app is wonderfully diverse, and I love the home page with suggestions for morning, midday, and evening mindfulness. There are also plenty of options for specific needs, and I use the kids meditations frequently with my children. I am so grateful that Andi Puddicombe had an idea for Headspace and ran with it. It has grown into such a great resource that is literally changing lives.',\n",
       " 'I’m a university student and my courses are intensive and fast. Needed an App to feel calm and relaxed to go to bed. They have so much variety in voice actors, relaxing music that can make you feel focused and calm at the same time. They have amazing quality nature sounds. Theres stories or narrative meditative walkthroughs. Theres still much to explore. So far its help for all my needs for focus and to calm my anxieties and to relax to sleep. If you are a student they have a sweet discount for the whole year. Its worth it.',\n",
       " 'This app is made very well. The quality of the app is great, no glitches not too sure but no ads. I really like the thought they put into the app. I have rated it a three because you have to pay six dollars a month to get anything on the app. I have downloaded this app a very long time ago and everything was free and it worked amazing. I am just a young student who wants a good night of sleep. I can’t pay six dollars a month. If the things on the app were free, it would be five stars without a doubt. If you can pay the six dollars a month, you go for it, it really does help.',\n",
       " 'This app is very useful for if you have any sort of disorder or nightmares your having lately. They help me sleep and meditate more often they are just very relaxing and I feel happy when I sleep and meditate or even get up for the day when I’m feeling down. I strongly suggest you get this app if you having trouble sleeping or being able to go out and run around and getting started with your day. Thank you headspace for doing this for me I and keep up the good work!🥰😺🍃',\n",
       " 'I have lived most of my life in state of dissociation; struggling with anxiety and then plummeting into depression. When I started seeking help and going to therapy, I learned about the Headspace app and the value of meditation in the healing journey. Headspace has been part of my life for a few years now. I’ve tried a number of other meditation app, but have finally settled back on this one. The guided meditation and music selected is exceptional, the graphics and animations make me smile. I highly recommend this app!',\n",
       " 'The convenience of having a meditation aid as close as my phone has made a significant change in my ability to meditate regularly. The grief module helped me thru the loss of my husband; the pain module helped through my broken elbow recovery. Now as I go they the Pro series I am getting deeper into what meditation is all about. Then there’s yoga modules. I Can’t say enough about the difference having this app on my phone has made in my life. Thank you headspace',\n",
       " 'I love knowing that Headspace is always available for me to turn to to lead me in a meditation when I need it.  I am able to yank myself out of any prevailing turmoil in my head and take a few minutes to reset, calm down and adopt a new perspective.  It has also been phenomenal for my sleep pattern.  If I wake in the night, I simply breathe and focus on the breath as in the guided meditations and miraculously fall back asleep in no time.  This has been a worthwhile investment in myself indeed!',\n",
       " 'During the pandemic, being diagnosed with a life long illness, having so much anxiety and dread I found this app. I can honestly say that it has changed how I live! The amount of help, clarity, and calmness I get from the days that I practice meditation makes a dramatic difference. But like anything else it takes practice. I do notice the major differences in the days that I don’t practice. I can honestly say that headspace has given me a way to feel better.',\n",
       " 'This is the best app if your struggling with falling asleep and going back to bed also is really good for staying and making you more  productive in life especially in work! I really recommend this, it  helps for everything and I   just really enjoy it and without this app, i was struggling with going and falling to sleep and i’m proud to put a five  star for this app and also taking  my time on writing this review thank you for the person who made this game!',\n",
       " 'This app has really opened my eyes to a new way of living life. This is actually the only app that has had a positive impact on my life. There are ways to cope with anxiety and ruminating thoughts. When I find myself in difficult situations mentally, I am always reminded to pay attention to my breath and let my thoughts pass through me because sometimes our thoughts don’t need to be taken so seriously. Thank you for helping my mindfulness journey, Headspace.',\n",
       " 'Nothing like having a checklist of things to do on my meditation app home screen. Definitely not stressful at all. I love seeing a big list of things I need to do throughout the entire day. I love it when an algorithm picks a bunch of random videos and playlists and then makes me feel compelled to watch them. Very thoughtful design choice and definitely feels grounded in care for the user and not in helping some product manager in charge of workout videos on a meditation app get their content onto the Home Screen somehow. Again, I love feeling pressured by my meditation app. Great feeling.',\n",
       " 'I signed up for the free trial as the app is very expensive and I wasn’t sure it’s for me.  App itself is great, really liked the sleep meditation.  However I decided it’s not for me and within one week I followed all steps provided by Headspace to cancel the service.  Immediately received a confirmation from them stating they received my cancellation request.  But at the end of two weeks today I was charged for the annual subscription amount.  I have no way to contact them except an email address that I have no idea if they check.  A CS chat option would be nice for issues like this.  At this point it looks like I need to go to my bank to dispute the charges.',\n",
       " 'Headspace has been a game changer for me. I’ve become more mindful and at peace with the challenges that arise every day. I’ve been able to encourage others to tackle their anxiety and issues through mindfulness and even walked my colleagues through a focusing meditation. I didn’t realize how much I would come to appreciate taking this space and time for silence until I started to reap the benefits! Would recommend using this app every day 10/10!',\n",
       " 'Am so grateful for this app!!  I am an entry level practitioner, and I appreciate the guided meditations, as well as, the group meditations.  I love the sound meditations, particularly the ocean pier recordings,  which help me to relax before sleeping.  One day, maybe I will be fit enough to try the exercises😜.   \\n Headspace has been a much-appreciated respite from the stress of frontline covid and from 24/7 political stress.  Truly.\\nThank you for all that you do to make this practice  understandable and available!🙂❤️',\n",
       " 'Sometimes I put off meditation like I put off calling my blabbery aunt who never stops talking. I know I need to do it, but “later” always seems like a better time. Headspace helps by making the experience way easier by providing a fun and intuitive user interface, and with amazing guided meditations that leave me feeling all warm and fuzzy on the inside. It feels like a massage for my brain, and I keep coming back for more after all these years.',\n",
       " 'Like any tool or technique, mindfulness is as useful as your ability to practice, build new capabilities, and the. enact this in everyday life.  Headspace makes it easy and inviting to make common knowledge into common practice with a variety of teachers, programs and content that will invite you back over and over.  I can’t think of an aspect of life that hasn’t improved a little or a lot as a result of consistently practicing with Headspace.  Thank you!',\n",
       " 'I’ve been using this app for months and am very pleased with it. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and using this app daily really helps to calm me down during the meditations. I use the practices they’ve taught me on my own outside of the app as well when I feel I need to reign back in my thoughts and emotions. Andy and Eve’s voices are so soothing to me and it’s comforting to have a partner or two on this journey of trying to achieve a calm mind and calm being! Highly recommend!',\n",
       " \"I've been using the app for about two years and love everything it offers, but I have one suggestion. The sleep meditations and sleep music are in night mode on their menus, but as soon as you are able to click play they go to a white screen. It messes with my eyes every night, and I use it at bedtime and in the middle of the night. Thank you for your consideration! Just hearing Andy's voice on TV commercials relaxes me. I'm so thankful for Headspace.\",\n",
       " 'I downloaded this app several years ago and almost immediately purchased the full version. \\n\\nLearning to meditate via the app has seen me through a slew of personal and professional crises. No matter what is going on in my life, I know I can carve out even just a few minutes for this important self-care.\\n\\nI owe an incredible debt of gratitude to Andy and all the people behind the app for helping me learn how to meditate and allowing me to discover how to just BE.',\n",
       " \"I have ADHD and this has been one of the best ways I have to help myself. That said, I have ADHD, sometimes I lose steam for a pack and quit halfway through. I want to re-train those aspects I didn't finish working through, so sometimes I would like to reset it so I don't have to remember where I was from day to day until I catch up! Other than that, helpful in a lot of ways and not just for regular people!\",\n",
       " 'I’ve used this app & the techniques it has taught me on & off since 2018. I’ve noticed that, despite truly being a good app with beneficial courses to improve one’s mental health, almost every single feature is now locked behind a Money Wall/Pay Wall. I can’t help but wonder if I was wrong about the people behind this app, seeing as I originally thought that their intentions were good. Now, I’m not so sure. I shouldn’t have to pay a chunk of money to be able to access courses, techniques, & patterns that can actually help me cope with my anxiety.',\n",
       " 'It bothers me immensely that the free version is so limited. Meditation should be freely given. To capitalize on the lack of mindfulness/the need of people in a modern society that is sick and distressed and disconnected in order to make money is sickening in my opinion. At the very least you could offer more free sos and sleep options. And you could organize it so that you can find the free options easier without having to scroll past 30 locked meditations that aren’t available unless you pay. Also too many suggestions that I start a “free trial” which we know is a gimmick to get at least some of my money.',\n",
       " 'I love this app and have been using it over the last year, both before the pandemic hit and over the latest 11 months. It has been a lifesaver during successive lockdowns I’m my area and has given me support and structure for a meditation practice. The additional cameo appearances during “the wake up” have been really grounding as well. Thank you to the entire Headspace community for your inspiration and insight to navigate these challenging times.',\n",
       " 'The app used to be simple and lovely and had a soothing feel to it. This was an invaluable refuge for a type A highly strung person like me. However, something terrible has happened recently and the app is now a cluttered mess. So many tabs, so many options, it\\'s bringing all that anxiety back again. Also I\\'d turned off notifications for anything but my daily reminder, yet I still keep getting \"suggestions\" from the app - which are really not helpful. Polluting my notifications is the last thing I need. Please fix this. Also can you make the app less cluttered somehow? I will be forever grateful.',\n",
       " 'I started using headspace several years ago when it first came out. The app seemed to be getting a little tired and the material seemed to stagnate after an initially awesome year or two. I left. Well, I’m back and I’m absolutely delighted with the content!! This app taught me to meditate, and I feel like I’ve come home again. 💕 Great work, and Thank you for all you do. I think your the best meditation app on the market! (I tried all the others too)',\n",
       " 'I started using Headspace 330 days ago never having focused on a healthy mind in my life.\\nI thought meditation was for unusual people who were in to an alternative lifestyle.\\nI never realized that they got it ,, living in the moment.. whatever the moment was . All the preexisting notions are now banished . I have been able to thrive during the pandemic not just exist . I am truly grateful that I have learned a new skill that will help me every moment of my new awareness of life !',\n",
       " 'I started using Headspace a couple of years ago during a stressful time and I am so impressed I’ve continued using it daily. I love everything about it. I started using the sleep wind downs to help me sleep then one of the meditation courses and now added the move part. I look forward to the wake up every day. My husband has even started using the app. Great, thought out content. Has become a real asset to every part of my life.',\n",
       " 'Meditation is hard. Life is distracting. I’ve seen how Headspace has evolved over the years and honestly, at 25, having these little five to ten minute sessions ready and on tap to re center my brain and re-route my thinking away from negative or distressing patterns is exceptionally useful. Headspace on your phone is like keeping a first aid kit in your car: when you need it, you are super happy it’s there.',\n",
       " 'I’ve tried meditation many times over the past 30 years but never felt I was doing it right. Until listening to Andy on Headspace! There is no wrong. How about that?! Also did the grief meditation series and finally let go of the sorrow I’ve been carrying surrounding the death of my mother when I was 13. I now have been able to picture her smiling which is so very rewarding. Give Headspace a go! I’m confident you will thoroughly enjoy it!',\n",
       " 'This is one of those rare apps that is truly worth every penny. Headspace has supported me in building a legitimate mediation practice. I use this app almost daily to help manage my anxiety. I do almost all my meditations with Andy. I love the consistency and the option to choose your preferred voice. I’ve also been getting into their sleep scapes which are a great way to slow down your mind if you’re having trouble winding down.',\n",
       " 'This is the only app I have ever paid for and it is so worth. It has been a vital piece to learning to\\nManage my anxiety and taking care of my mental health. I am Not an amazing meditator and eat distracted easily but I absolutely love listening to Andy talk. His voice is so soothing. They all are, but especially him.\\nI have recommended this to many friends and will continue to do so. \\nI’ve also used it to get my kids back to sleep in the middle of the night!',\n",
       " 'As a long time yoga practitioner, I knew how helpful meditation is, but with the stress of the pandemic and even before that I just wasn’t doing it. Headspace got me back to sitting again. I love and his voice, I love all the choices they give you in terms of what you wanna focus on or how long you want to practice. The basics one course with its three minute meditations was exactly what I needed to rememberHow good it feels to just sit.',\n",
       " 'Was brand new to meditating when I first got this app a few years ago. Even though I have some experience now, I still continue to use it. I really like that they are moving meditations and different series to help you through the various challenges in life. I also love that there’s a children’s section. My children ask for Andy by name when they have a nightmare or when they’ve had a rough day.',\n",
       " 'The self awareness developed in this course brings peace, focus, freedom from cravings. I originally started during covid because I couldn’t sleep. It was amazingly effective. Then I found how much more it had to offer. It isn’t magic, it isn’t metaphysical, but it is the most practical, effective approach to meditation I have ever found. If you are looking for something more, release from anxiety, acceptance of what you think is unbearable....try it.',\n",
       " 'I absolutely love this app! I use it everyday and then some more! I do have a suggestion I would love to see in this app! I love using the soundscapes but I wish I could use that as well as listen to the “teacher” or “narrator” at the same time! That would be amazing in my eyes because even while meditating I could have a little background noise like rain or etc. same goes for sleeping! Again this app is really amazing!',\n",
       " 'Please go back to your old layout. I am a massive here on the app, however, The new layout utterly disgusts me. I mean sure, it’s still usable. But it’s very disappointing to see that you have taken away The old one because it was far more appealing. It just looked better. I mean I guess other people might like it, but I simply do not. And I beg of you, please please please please please please please go back to your old layout. Please know that the only reason I read it one star is because I wanted it to be seen by y’all. I think it is a grand and nifty app and I would normally rated four or even five stars.\\n\\nSincerely, you’re number one fan',\n",
       " 'I am a healthcare provider and finding out that Headspace is supporting front line providers by giving them access to their programs was wonderful. I do think it has definitely made a difference for me as I used it during this very trying year. I would recommend it to anyone and find it not only easy to use, but customizable and not hokey at all. Truly a great way to begin the journey of practicing meditation. Thanks, Headspace.',\n",
       " 'Weather you are a beginner,intermediate, or expert at meditating headspace is great! I started with headspace at the beginning or the quarantine! As everything went into lockdown I was spending a lot more time at home and that allowed me to get inside of my head too much. Started having massive anxiety attacks. I recognized that I needed to do something about this. I turned to headspace! With the help of headspace, my attacks have become almost non existent! Thank you!',\n",
       " 'A bit of back information, I have anger issues, really bad, and when my sister and I get into fights I use this app to calm me down. I go to my room. And let this app carry me away. It is amazing and please support this app. It deserves so much for how much it helps people. This app will not waste your time. Meditating is so good for the mind. And there are free sessions. Please get this app. I think if everyone had a dose of meditation a day, it would help a lot.',\n",
       " 'This app has changed my life for the better. That seems like a weird thing to say about a program on your phone, but the fact that it is so easy to use has helped me make meditation a part of my daily life. That in turn helped my anxiety and my life overall. \\n\\nThe only thing I would like to see done, is for them to add a favorites button, so I can keep track of my fav meditations more easily!',\n",
       " 'If you have never tried meditation, the you must give it a try right now. It will allow you to discover your inner self. It will give you confidence, increase your focus, improve your stamina, and much more. We all should be spending at least 5 to 10 minutes every day, no matter what’s happening in your life. I just reached 500 days streak. The feeling is unique. Try it today!',\n",
       " 'This app and the amazing teachers, lessons, sleep casts, and more have changed my life. Im finding it quite difficult to even put into words how magnificent this app has been for transforming my outlook on my relationships, myself, my presence, and just about every singular aspect of my life. It has been the best decisions I have ever made and I have never once had a doubt in my mind that this wasn’t the best choice I ever made for myself.',\n",
       " 'I was new to meditations when I found this app, but was looking for something that was less spiritual. The user friendliness of it instantly caught my attention. I love having daily reminders and fun short, digestible videos to help recenter me. I support anyone who is looking for a meditation app that is more like cognitive therapy to give this an opportunity. With new videos, subject matters, and playlist I’m exciting to continue my journey with this supportive app.',\n",
       " \"I tried it.  I love the way Andy explains things, so I used this app to get a friend meditating who was new to it.  The animations in the beginning are very helpful for my friend, and I'm getting a lot out of the anxiety and sleep modules. I'm looking forward to trying out the cooking one snd the like.  Anyway, Andy's voice is lovely, the way he describes things is helpful and as you go on, the sessions become less guided which is wonderful too.\",\n",
       " 'This app is AMAZING don’t get me wrong there is so much room for decision! But to almost get to anything you have to pay for a membership. I don’t really wanted to pay money for a stress reliever app. But almost everything is locked when you don’t sign in and pay, it’s almost like their forcing you to sign in. I’m going to delete the app, but it makes me so sad because this app had so many different options for relieving your stress. That’s why I gave this app a 3 star rating. If you want to pay then definitely download this app.',\n",
       " 'I have learned I need to meditate every day to feel centered. I like the different places available for various situations. I have one question... where is The Wakeup? That alone encouraged me to begin my morning meditation. Each presentation was interesting, the people knowledgeable and friendly, and the subject matter always informative. Even the little opening jingle was pleasant and I looked forward to it every day.\\nThank you for Headspace.',\n",
       " 'I wish you could navigate through the courses by skipping levels. Some of the entry levels are the same for each course, and it’s unfortunate you can’t have the power over your own practice. The interface is also REALLY confusing to navigate through. I wish you could “favorite” things or put them into a queue. I see one that looks interesting while I’m browsing for something else and then I can never find it again.',\n",
       " 'Since 2016, I found I struggled with depression and anxiety. I wasn’t able to see a therapist when I needed one, but my sister recommended headspace and it was at a perfect time. By the time I was able to see a therapist it ended up being more just to learn than it was to feel rescued. Not saying this replaces therapy, but I believe headspace is a powerful tool and a big blessing that we have something like this in our lives',\n",
       " 'I used to meditate all the time a few years ago. Then I started doing it less and less. Since I downloaded headspace and started at the basic level I have noticed that my mind has become less cluttered with the mundane thoughts and way more relaxed. This app is really great, and if you are looking for something to help calms the storms in your mind or just to help you relax form a long day. This is a great place to start.',\n",
       " 'I have honestly changed for the better with this app and I use the tools I’ve learned every day. It is truly life-changing. Any way you can make an ipad friendly app? What I mean by that is, when I have my ipad in the landscape orientation, the graphics stay locked in portrait orientation. Thats really the ONLY thing this app is missing. We love all of its features and use it day and night.',\n",
       " 'Yes it is a amazing app and I could make a list about the things they did to relax me but a lot of things you need a membership for. I know you need to make money but your main thing should be people’s relaxation. For example I have trouble sleeping and the calming music is memberships only…why should members have a quick sleep? Once again this app is so calming and would 100% recommend but (if the president of the app is reading this) please stop the membership stuff…. :)',\n",
       " 'I’m in love with this new version of Headspace with a pre-made schedule of meditations. I’ve been sporadically using the app mostly because I never knew what to choose to meditate on. Now it’s just so much easier to use the app. I love it!\\nThe only piece of feedback I have is that I would also love to see a tool that would help me recognize how or what I am feeling and then recommend a meditation based on that.',\n",
       " 'Headspace has changed my life for the better. Making mediation part of my everyday has helped to alleviate the symptoms of my anxiety and my medical conditions. It is excellent for everyone from beginners to those who are experienced with the art of meditation. I find the stats helpful and the streak keeps me motivated to meditate even on days I may not feel like it. For anyone on fence, it is well worth the investment. Invest in yourself, you deserve it.',\n",

I came here to the App Store and found an update, I updated, but still it is buffering. I went to the Headspace Facebook group, the FAQ freezes at a point saying Safari has to accept cookies (I already have Safari set properly). Headspace should be calming stress, not causing it.',\n",
       " 'At first I was skeptical of meditation. Where would I find the time? How long do I have to sit still? But honestly it starts you off slow enough that you ease into and you find the time. Gradually you find more time and what’s the best time to meditate. \\n\\nI usually meditate every morning but sometimes, after a long day I meditate at night also. \\n\\nIt’s really helping me guide myself to the person I want to become in 2021.',\n",
       " 'I’ve used a couple of different meditation apps, but Headspace is my favorite. I like how they aren’t overly-philosophical or mystical in their approach to their meditation exercises. They keep it relatively simple and offer a variety of exercises and courses for different situations. I also really like the narrators’ voices and styles. I’ve used some of the Sleepcasts too; they’re nice, but the meditation exercises are the best part of the app and the most life-changing for me personally.',\n",

Headspace has helped me with controlling the stress I’ve been dealing with the past two months and helped with my sleep too!

Headspace is a very beneficial app and I would recommend it.',\n",

Many things may get dropped from a busy day, but not meditation; even if I have to shorten the time. Meditation is such a powerful instigator, and yet so quiet as it moves. Yes! It moves quietly and surely like the breath😊it makes changes within that seem to have occurred on their own. Namaste',\n",

One month after buying the one year subscription, my 15 year old daughter asked if she could start using headspace. I’ve emailed twice, which both took a week to get a response. The third email never even got a response. And their only advise for upgrading to the family plan is to cancel my membership and wait for it to expire and then signing up for the family plan.

The app has a wide selection of meditations and durations. It’s is reliable and easy to use. And I’m fortunate that my company pays for the subscription.',\n",
       " 'This is really great for learning to meditate. I’ve gotten A LOT out of it and I couldn’t be more grateful for the peace I’ve gained. The app functionality is a little underwhelming. It’s sorted, which is great. And I can search for a specific topic. But you can’t mark them for later. I wish I could just click a button to review later.',\n",
       " 'This app makes daily meditation possible for me. When I’m exhausted and I feel like I can’t sit still for 20 minutes on my own, this app has a way of “tricking” me into doing that very same thing. Sometimes, finding the smooth path in my life involves tricking my clever and devious brain. This app is a great life hack',\n",
       " 'I love how each instructor has their own unique offering in their tone of voice. But as a whole this app allows you to easy access a meditative space with a huge variety of meditation needs. From anger to a simple daily practice with variations in time as well. Thank you Headspace',\n",
       " 'Using this app is the one of the best things I’ve ever done on this phone to help myself and those around me. This app offers many different ways to balance, become more aware, and let the body rest and recover. Unpretentious and playful, yet powerfully direct and based on ancient meditation practice.',\n",
       " 'Headspace for me is life changing. Andy’s voice is so soothing and calming that even in my most anxious moments I am able to unwind and relax. So thankful for this and for the year free because this has been the most difficult year for us financially and business wise with these shutdowns in California affecting our business.',\n",
       " 'I love love love Headspace. It is the best meditation out there because it has courses that build on one another, rather than having to select a one off meditation each time. It’s kept me accountable and has deepened my mindfulness practice so much. 10/10 would recommend. Has truly changed my life',\n",
       " 'Signed up for headspace during the pandemic and it is the best! Their sleep meditation really helps my husband to sleep. I have used some of their meditation courses and those have helped too. Lastly they’ve got some white noise (like Ocean time) that helps our baby sleep as well. Win win for all of us :)',\n",
       " 'This is a very good, well-produced product. The meditations are excellent and genuinely beneficial. I had no idea there was a child section when I purchased this, but now my seven-year-old daughter and I listen to a meditation for her every night before she drifts off. It is teaching her a real life skill.',\n",
       " 'I’m so grateful for Headspace. My husband died in February 2020. Shortly after his death everything was shut down due to Covid-19.  I was grieving and the loneliness was unbearable.  I did the counseling course.  It helped me so much, Andy’s voice was like listening to a friend.  I’m still lonely and grieving but I’m looking forward to the future. Thank you Headspace.',\n",
       " 'Loved using Headspace for meditation as well as a sleep aid for months. I have noticed marked improvement in my stress and anxiety levels partially due to the resources on this app. That said, it’s clear that Andy and Headspace are choosing to sell themselves out to companies that have nothing to do with meditation. Music and workouts in a meditation app? What? Stay true to yourself. Eh, I guess it’s just business.',\n",
       " 'I love this app for many reasons. This helps me with stress and it is amazing. It’s in my routine wake up listen to this then so whatever then around lunch time I would listen to any other\\none and lastly before I sleep. I probably use this app more then most apps on my phone. If you are reading this before downloading to look at the reviews I recommend to download it. Thank you for creating this wonderful app!',\n",

       " 'This app saved my life. As a provider working in covid, I never have time to see a therapist but these little 5 minute meditations have helped me stay healthy and sane! I am so grateful they gave it for free to health care providers, but even if I had to pay it would be worth what it has given back to me!',\n",
       " 'This is such a perfectly set up app. Everything about it is peaceful, calm, deliberate , and organized into logical steps. I find some other meditation apps to be cluttered, chaotic, intense in graphics , etc to gain your attention. I find this to be the opposite of meditation. Headspace is a perfect “balance of balance” of ideas and practice. Very healing !',\n",
       " 'This has been a huge shift for the positive in my daily life, and from something so simple as sitting quietly fir a short time every day. Great thoughts from Andy that definitely have helped calm my restless mind, and keep a steady focus through the day instead of feeling depleted after half of it is done.',\n",
       " 'I am just beginning but I can honestly say that I have moments of peace that I was not aware of before.  I view this as a journey with many curves, the destination is a greater peace and the ability to know when I need to pull back or when I need to move one step further.',\n",

       " 'I love this app! Lots of courses to target issues that may be clouding your mind. I used this everyday for a short 10 minutes and found it tremendously helpful. Things that used to bother me, just roll off my back now. Download it and don’t look back!',\n",
       " 'This app is such an incredible tool for those uninitiated to meditation. I was searching for resources on how to embark on this journey and the use of the daily guided meditations is such a good entry way to understanding what it is to sit! So many amazing guides and different focus points I can’t speak highly enough. Use it every day.',\n",

Thank you, Headspace, for making this app a reality. 👏🏼',\n",
       " 'Mindfulness and meditation are scientifically proven practices to manage struggles with mental health. I was first introduced to these things by a therapist as a tool to address my chronic anxiety and depression. Since then, my ability to cope has only gotten better. Thanks to Headspace I have an easy, approachable way to find deeper joy in life.',\n",
       " 'The Wake Up used to be the highlight of my morning. I started watching the peaceful videos combined with breathing exercises and short meditations during quarantine in spring ‘20. They started by removing the meditations, then only showed the peaceful videos once a week, and now it seems they’ve removed the breathing exercises. I will really miss the old Wake Up. 😢 I also wish more of your content had captions for the Deaf/HH folks.',\n",

       " 'I never write app reviews, but I had to for Headspace.  It was an app my therapist suggested to me when I had no idea where to start.  It makes meditation simple, calm, and easy for someone like me who stresses out about doing even meditation correctly.\\n\\nI love how many options there are of different states if mind that they can help talk you through rebalancing yourself.\\n\\nI have recommended this app to every friend who mentions how they want to get started in meditating.  I would have given up if I didn’t have such a simple and colorful guide like this.\\n\\nEven the design of the app is so calming.  I love it.',\n",

       " 'I have tried a couple of meditation apps, but headspace of by far my favorite. Simple, clear, fun and engaging it’s such an important tool. I have all my clients get headspace, because it’s such an important part of their practice. Change your thinking and you can change your life.',\n",

       " 'I definitely recommend this app it has helped me sleep and meditate, 3 different voices you can listen too and hundreds of sessions that really do help. I use headspace whenever I can! I mean it really has been proven that meditation  once a day is super super healthy headspace helps so much and is really relaxing',\n",
       " 'Whenever I downloaded Headspace, I thought it would be free and I honestly think it should be free. I know you guys want to make money off of it, but it’s a app for meditation. I know it probably isn’t ideal, but I would rather do one payment of $5-$15 than 70 dollars a year or 13 dollars every month. Sure there might be a 7-day free trial, but I don’t think it really matters. Thinking about this problem makes me have even more frustration and it is now hard for me to meditate thinking about how I can’t finish.',\n",
       " 'This is so much more than a meditation app.  There are so many resources for healthy living including exercise, mindful eating and just great information on al those emotions that daily get our way.  As a psychologist, I can hear the lessons are well rooted in sound research.  I highly recommend.',\n",
       " 'I’ve loved Headspace for awhile now, but I love the new layout even more. It’s nice to open the app and not really have to “think” about which meditation to do; I have a layout of my day and options. I can already tell it will make me more likely to meditate. Please keep this layout!',\n",
       " 'Have used the Headspace app for a year and a half and I feel its a fantastic app for beginners. It has a very progressive slope which can help one ramp up their meditation practice.\\nThe only con I feel is it does not incentivize the user to meditate regularly, which could help the user be more regular with their practice.',\n",
       " 'Headspace was a great place for me to begin my meditation practice. It is simple, easy to use as an app and will help the user begin their practice. I’ve been using it in my practice for five years. For those who want to go deeper than calming the mind, into broadening our experience of consciousness, eventually you’ll have to look elsewhere.',\n",

       " 'I saw headspace on ads for years but never got it because I thought I knew how to meditate so I didn’t think it was worth paying for it , but once I gave it a shot it’s a real game changer I’ve been using it everyday to help me stay focused and calm throughout the day.',\n",
       " 'I hit the “try free” button and was immediately charged for the full year. I guess it’s because I signed up for a free trial in the past that I had forgotten about? I assumed (reasonably I think) that if I was ineligible for a free trial, the app would have told me that and wouldn’t have repeatedly advertised one to me. Like I said, the button I pressed literally said “Try Free.” Pretty bad start to a business relationship for an app to explicitly tell me I’m not going to be charged and then to immediately charge me $70.',\n",
       " 'Headspace has definitely helped me. From helping me to fall asleep at night and helping me to keep my calm to waking up. Headspace reminded me it’s okay for your mind to wander off, but in the end it will always come back, and mind, body, and speech, are one again. Headspace is a lifesaver, and I’d be lost without having headspace.',\n",
       " 'Headspace truly changed the way I think about meditation - therefore, has changed my life. It made a practice that I was struggling to get into easier. I was actually was able to sit in a non-judgements space with myself and WANT to meditate everyday. I recommend headspace to all my fitness clients.',\n",
       " 'Had a free trial and loved it. For a new iPhone 11 and couldn’t log in. Couldn’t reset password. Didn’t recognize my account, but charged me for the yearly membership.

Ended up disputing with my credit card company and going with another app. Too bad but who has the time for this?!! No thanks!',\n",

       " 'My first few meditation sessions went well... except for intrusive thoughts of “this isn’t my idea of being productive!”\\nAnd ironically I begin to understand *that’s* the point: remove yourself from the ‘productive’ world; move yourself mentally and physically inward, away from involvement with the outside world. Say ‘hello’ to yourself, “how are ya’ doing in there?”\\nAnd listen for the answer.',\n",

       " 'I love this app but I wish you could stack / make a playlist. For example, I like to listen to a 5 or 10 minute wind down before listening to a sleep cast. It would be nice to have a playlist to just hit play and be guided off to sleep.',\n",
       " \"The thing about this app that I really can't handle is the voices they use for the meditations and sleep casts. They are not at all soothing and many of them have this weird gargle-y scratchy tone in their voice that makes me want to scream and cry at the same time. Working for the horrible corporation of Starbucks gives me this app for free though, so I'll use it until I can't handle working for one of corporate America's demons any longer.\",\n",

I’m talking one session, two tops.\\n\\nOthers of Note: I’m stuck listening to Kevin Hart when I run. I don’t personally like the man for a racist birthday party he held for his son (I’m indigenous). I wish I could have options to listen to other speakers like in guided meditation in their application. When I think “mindful runs” I don’t go straight to Kevin Hart of all people.
