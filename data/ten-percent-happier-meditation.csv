Fast forward to 2020 - I became a first-time mom at 38 years old, suffered from postpartum depression, and just when I was starting to find my footing, the world was immediately hurled into the COVID-19 pandemic. The stress wreaked havoc on my body. Everyday I felt like I was physically drowning; my chest was cramped, my muscles ached, I was permanently exhausted but couldn’t sleep, and my brain was foggy. I tried taking anxiety medication and it made me extremely nauseous, which further triggered my anxiety. I thought I was doomed; I felt so helpless. Then I read Dan Harris’s book, 10% Happier, and I figured if meditation helped him, maybe it would help me. Now I use the app daily, in conjunction with a daily routine that involves yoga, reasonably healthy eating, supplements as recommended by my physician, and continued communication and collaboration with my support net of friends and family. It’s part of a bigger picture, and it has made a world of difference. Physically, the chest tightness and muscular tension have decreased significantly. And mentally I find myself much more resilient in the face of stress, especially the kind induced by the intrusive irrational fears that come with GAD. Thank you to the 10% Happier team. In my case, “10% Happier” would be an understatement.",False,Ringer22,ten-percent-happier-meditation,992210239

I would say the free app has turned out to be my personal “silver lining” during the pandemic.

Although I have dabbled in mindfulness and meditation a little bit over the years, neither really “clicked” with me, even after trying other related apps. This app is different. The variety of teaching formats has made a crucial difference. For instance, the videos that show how meditation and mindfulness can change the brain really helped me, the ADD skeptic, better understand and accept the practice of meditation as legit. I also love the way Dan interacts with his guests and brings his personal experiences to the table. 

I have found the meditations that have science-related informational nuggets sprinkled throughout them the most helpful, I think because they engage multiple aspects of my brain, thus holding my attention better.

I didn’t know what to say so I said i had to run and i would catch up with her later. I decided the only way to get myself out of this mess was to actually download the app and give it a go. I completed the first two sessions of my course that morning and went on to explore the other content and found myself enthralled in this app for more than an hour.

The first being that many of the foremost teachers are represented. Also, two things relating to content and presentation. One, there are apps out there that boast about ‘40,000 free meditations’. The problem is that some of them sound like they were recorded on my father’s cassette recorder from 1967, from across tge room. Poor sound quality is difficult to excuse in 2020, as are noise from traffic, conversations in the distance, air conditioning etc. 

Unless you need the digital waterfalls, digital birds cirping, cavernous reverb on the teacher’s voice and the like, you might prefer-as do I- the simple, minimalistic presentation and crystal clear recordings that are the hallmarks of Ten Percent. To me, that other stuff starts out as a distraction and quickly becomes an annoyance.I sort of think of guided meditations as training wheels anyway, something that gets you started. Ultimately, you might want to meditate in a circle with other people or without recorded guidance, at least some of the time. Try meditating without the overproduction for a month and see what you think. Lately, it’s either 10% or a simple timed meditation for me.

I would think you are aware of the error by now but you never know.   i could be mistaken, but that is not likely, as i try to see and hear as much of Sam Harris as i can.  When i first came across his efforts i was and i guess still am listening to Alan Watts.  Sam was maybe the third person in my life that spoke my language.  That is,  he would often confirm for me ideas and conclusions i had knocking around in my head for a long time and newer thoughts as well.  Soon as that kind of thing happens, well, thats a friend of mine.  Anyway,  its amazing to me how after he lectures,  people can still find ways to fool themselves in order to continue believing something that is so clearly inaccurate.

I was continually cycling through intro videos for a long time.  They’re so kind to beginner meditators and are instructional in ways that were incredibly helpful to my easily distracted self.

When the COVID outbreak began and 10 Percent offered free full access to essential employees, I was beyond happy. As a stressed-out hospital employee and last semester grad student in NYC, this was one of the most meaningful and caring things I could have gotten.  I have been able to meditate longer than I ever thought was possible before. I’ve been able to decompress and wind down after long, high stress days. It has truly improved my quality of life in one of the most tumultuous times I’ve ever experienced. 

I never write reviews. But I really had to say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making this phenomenal program.

I’ve always watched Dan Harris on GMA on the weekends and I loved watching him and Paula Farris. They are my favorite anchor people (although Paula Farris has left sometime back). I’ve always enjoyed hearing Dan Harris talk about the “ten percent” but never gave the app much thought. Now that covid-19 has hit our communities hard, the need to learn how to stay mindful is key. It’s even harder because covid-19 hasn’t just taken away our form of being (going to concerts, eating out, going to a movie theater, studying at a coffee shop) it’s taken away our sense of reality. The only way to get that back learning to be “mindful” and learning to stay in the moment and knowing that we need to respond and not react, that’s the only way we’re gonna keep our sanity through covid. Dan Harris does a nice job of connecting us with the right people at the right time. It’s an awesome set up and nicely done to teach us how to be mindful.

I tried this mostly so I could say I tried but never expected anything. Today is my 28th day if using the app daily. 

I immediately felt different—more grounded and balanced—and, yes, happier. I started with The Basics course and appreciated the “learn” part of each session and Dan’s very real, typical person questions and comments. The Type A in me also loves that I can SEE “success” in the app’s tracking of mindful days, sessions, etc—and esp my streak! 😂 Even if I miss my AM meditation (which I hate missing now), I can listen to a Talk while on the go and still get in my mindfulness fix! I use a sleep meditation EVERY night, and it has truly improved my sleep by helping me soothing and focusing my swirling thoughts.

This approach definitely works much better for me than, say, Deepak Chopra’s approach. And I have nothing against Deepak Chopra. I just love the Everyman vibe of this program. I do have two minor suggestions for improvements, though.

I have noticed that if you rewind part of a video or meditation and watch or listen to that part over again, or fast forward (maybe you watched part of it and are trying to pick up where you left off), the time is counted strangely. It tends to overcount your time. I think it’s counting the time you fast forward through, if you fast forward, for example, instead of the actual time the video is playing. I would love for that to get fixed.

I also recently started downloading some meditation courses, and I noticed that the closed captioning option disappeared after I did that. So the exact same course will have closed captioning if I’m streaming it, but not if it’s been downloaded. Please fix that as well.",False,Kris CV,ten-percent-happier-meditation,992210239

I have another popular meditation app, but this one is proving more useful to me these days because they are so honest, direct, and topical. The teachers are diverse. Another cool feature is that you can often choose the length of your meditation depending on your time and attention at the moment. Lots of great sleep meditations, too. My only critique is that after every meditation it gives me a kind of cheer of how well I’m doing and adds up how many times I’ve meditated,  and I don’t really need or want that kind of feedback.

I came across this app in 2018 in a very stressful period of my life. I had this work that somehow led to a very anxious and nervous state of my mind and I had no idea how to fix it.

I started with 1 minute meditation at home and it worked!then I did it in a subway, at work, even in the toilet. I got used to letting my stress out and it stopped accumulating in my body so easily.

The guided meditations are easy to follow. Nowadays, this app has become a resource for me when I need some emotional grounding. If I’m upset and I meditate, I usually come out of the meditation feeling a whole lot better. 

With lots of practice, I have been able to use the skills I learn in meditation in my life when I’m not meditating. Mindfulness is a great tool to help keep us from getting so overwhelmed. We can find peace in the present moment. Think about it, is right now that bad? You’re sitting here reading my review. You might be worrying but I guarantee you you’re worried about the past or the future, because the present is okay for the most part. 

I have gotten my little brother and my mom to start using this app. They both love it and talk to me about it all the time now. My brother finds the Loving Kindness meditations particularly helpful. My mom is more of a beginner but she says the app has helped her feel less anxiety about the coronavirus. That’s a big win for us all. 

I love this app. I would recommend Ten Percent Happier to my loved ones, as I have already. It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or a pro, this app can help you with your mindfulness practice.

A friend recommended this app and I really respect her, so I gave it a shot. I fully intended to cancel before the free week was up. I’m not big on paying for apps that I may use a couple of times. I was surprised how simple and successful meditation/mindfulness became. I’m still a newb to this but wanted to put it out there that it’s worth the money! I also realized that this app is a form of self-therapy and by investing in it, you take it more seriously.

I’m a beginning meditator, and am finding the sessions to be clear, positive and encouraging - and the coaches are all great. There are courses dealing with many of the things that beset us in life, and a number of shorter sessions as well.

 The one thing that I wish was added is a continuing refresh of additional 1 minute meditations. It’s a very stealthy - and successful- approach to luring you into another 5-10 minutes of meditating. 

BTW, I think the style of coaches is really important. I’ve been using the  Calm app - for sleep stories - but am unable to use most of their meditation sessions; I’m so put off by most of the meditation coaches’ intonation - the  breathy ‘I’m smiling beatifically from my trip to the ashram’ kind of voice. I know I should be more accepting, but I just start gritting my teeth.  The one exception was Jeff Warren, who’s terrific - and he’s on the 10 app as well. I actually signed up for 10 app partly because he’s one of the coaches.

One of the problems I see with similar apps is how very little you get unless you pay for a subscription. And for many of us who can’t afford it or do not want another subscription, you are given very slim pickings.

You have at least 20 (maybe 30 meditations) you can choose from for free, at varying lengths of times—which is perfect for those with busy lives or short attention spans (especially beginners). They also do have longer mediations or light/no guidance ones available for free.

2020-01-13 02:26:52,,YOU GUYS,5,"I have ADHD — the word “frantic” does not begin to describe my brain. When I first began using the app just two weeks ago, I was frustrated with myself. My brain did its usual thing: it doesn’t just “wander off,” it goes on six-month backpacking trips to a different continent without cell service. I didn’t think the meditation was working. Didn’t think it could work for people like me. 

But it does, and here’s how I know: there have been several occasions in the last few days with my husband and son where, even just a month ago, I would have instantly reacted (and not in a helpful manner). Instead, I paused. I PAUSED. I have never, ever been able to pause. I thought I was born without pauses. I cannot tell you how helpful that tiny pause is. Am I 10% happier? Not sure, but the people around me are, thanks to this app. It is helping me parent with more empathy because I’m able to stop for just a split second. That split second is enough, weirdly, to bring yourself down and ask: how do I want to respond here? When you can choose how you respond, you’ll quickly find that you respond in a much kinder, calmer, productive manner than if you can’t choose. Meditation is about creating more split second pauses. There is a wise, calm person living inside of you. I promise. This app can help you find her. 

If you sign up for the trial, check out the “Stress Better” series. The woman leading you through those meditations is fantastic. She is like a human version of Yoda: calm, she will make you. I learned a lot about the actual mechanics of stress from that series, too.

One extremely minor thing is that I wish the reminder would “talk” to the app, so you don’t get a reminder on days you’ve already meditated with the app or when you’re in the middle of actually using the app. 

Anyway, highly recommend. Try it out, throw 10-15 minutes at this every day, and I think you and your relationships will change for the better.",False,odkdc,ten-percent-happier-meditation,992210239

2021-05-03 19:04:03,,"Not a hokey space religion, but a practical way to be mindful",5,"I was initially weary of meditation because of how it had been presented to me before. It seemed like something reserved for New Age practitioners (no hate to them at all) or tied to certain religions (again, no hate).  10% Happier, however, focuses on guided meditation practices removed from any religious or spiritual framework. It focuses on the moment and helping you to be kind to yourself and your inner thought life. 

It’s broken up into different courses based on different needs. Some of the courses help you with stress, or forming batter habits, or having more patience, etc. Each session within each course gives a video rundown of the concepts of that day’s mediation in the style of an interview between Dan Harris and the meditation professional who will then guide you in the actual practice. You are not locked in to these course once you start; you can mix and match as you go. There is even an entire section devoted to meditations designed to help you fall asleep!

I should note, however, that the free version only allows you into the basics course. While helpful, it is limited to teaching you the basics of meditation. The premium version can be purchased on a monthly or yearly basis and I highly recommend it. 

The interface is very clean and if you ever have questions, you can email a meditation professional from within the app and they will get back to you promptly with as much help as they can offer. 

For anyone looking for a wonderful, guided meditative practice, this is definitely worth a try. This isn’t some hokey space religion or some impractical, out of body experiment.

The use of video talks and then meditation incorporating the talks helps make the information stick. The courses are my favorite part. I have done all of them and continue to rewatch them on a regular basis. 

I used the coaches feature where you can ask your questions to a coach. I asked about equanimity in dealing with some of the social injustices and family struggles I care about but often feel helpless to change. My coach (Liz) thoughtfully responded to my question and we had back and forth dialogue concerning my struggles. She gave me several suggestion including a nice list of books to explore what other experts have done. I’ve read three of those books over the past six months and they have helped me gain this active hope for what I can do to take care of our world, everyone, including myself. Just lovely. 

I’ve been a paid subscriber for three years and just renewed my annual subscription in April 2020.

I've tried many different apps and this one is my favorite and the most helpful hands down! 
Access to a variety of different teachers and access to so many valuable meditations on a wide variety of topics!  The walking meditations are some of my favorites.
I'm 65+, disabled and blessed to be a survivor of extreme narcissistic, emotional, physical and mental abuse most of my life.  I've used meditation and breathing exercises for many years to bring myself off the ledge more times than I can count!  Pills just don't do it.... This app has transformed my meditation practice to a level that I never imagined!  It's so empowering to bring myself back from panic without a pill. 
Now meditation comes very easily and deeply to me whenever I need to come back to my center, my heart and soul. It's as natural and easy as activities of daily life.  It can be tapped into at any time!  The benefits are lifesaving!  This gift of taking away the 
feeling of ""rules"" for proper, healing  effective meditation are non existent .  There aren't rules just a commitment to practice a few minutes everyday or a few days a week.  Whatever you feel is best for you in this moment.  The ""swinging from the chandelier"" anxiety and panic I used to live with every day have become a thing that I can control or for sure greatly decrease the intensity of. 
My need for prescription medicine to control my anxiety has decreased markedly.  My blood pressure is improving so much that my cardiologist has lowered the dose and # of doses per day! 
I feel a underlying sense of peace and calm that I can't explain!  It's like being 5 again and having nothing to think about but playing,  naps and TODAYS FUN! I find joy in the smallest of things!  Fixing a snack, walking in my neighborhood, MUSIC !  This app and instructors way of simplifying meditation language has changed me!
I meditate several times a day sometimes, it's like eating or getting dressed, it's part of my daily routine and if I miss a day it's okay, no rules!  Just a wonderful tool in my little box of tools that I can access when I need to.
I do believe that it's important to try to practice at least ~10 minutes 4-6 times a week for it to become a routine for you. You can use this tool anytime anywhere!  Once you learn how quickly you can get to that place of quiet inner peace then you just tap into that and go there for as long as you want or feel you need to.
How can I ever thank you enough! 
I would give you 10⭐️ if I could!
We need to be teaching these simple, effective self compassion & self care to our children as part of their education!

2020-09-28 19:14:12,,Meditation without the WooWoo.,5,"I consider myself a semi spiritual person, but tend to fight the urge to roll my eyes at a lot of the phrases associated with spirituality.  Still, after years of stress and struggles with my ADHD symptoms, I came across several articles that showed benefits from meditation in both areas, so I decided to give it a try.

Being a busy mom and entrepreneur, I knew I wouldn’t have time (or money) to go to a center regularly, so I started researching all the apps.  At one point I had nearly a dozen on my phone.  In the end, 10% Happier was an easy choice for several reasons.

1 - no nonsense approach to meditation.  Fan presents the facts, and how it is helpful in a clear way as only a journalist can.  No woowoo in sight.

2 - the courses were a wonderful way to keep the momentum going.  One of my ADHD struggles is that the smallest decisions feel incredibly important.  With just a list of hundreds of meditations, I get overwhelmed and spend the whole time I could be meditating just making a choice.  With the courses, that pet got a LOT easier.  And there was the curiosity factor to bring me back the next day, and the next.

3 - the interviews for the courses I found unique and engaging.  Dan asks the questions I would have asked and some I didn’t even think of but was glad to know the answer to.  It was nice to have an intellectual explanation before trying out the technique.

4 - it genuinely feels like meditation for ALL.  Having “begin again” drilled into you skull helps you remember that you haven’t FAILED when your brain wanders, you’ve had another opportunity to practice NOTICING it has wandered, which is the real practice.  You don’t need to be Buddhist or spiritual, you can do it just for the stress relief.  All religions and/or no religion at all is welcome.

2020-08-20 15:24:17,,Meditation Home,5,"I’ve meditated for years but always sporadically. I combined it with yoga and other modalities. I’ve done it as a solo practice. Finally, with the TPH app, I’ve found a meditation home. First I used the free version for months; i didn’t want to pay if it was just going to fade out of my consciousness again. My husband got me the annual subscription for my Birthday when I became confident that it was not a fleeting meditation relationship. 

I use the app daily for close to a year now (344days).  There is such a variety of content from short to long meditations, short in app talks to longer podcasts, single meditations on a wide-range of topics to in depth courses for deep dives. There are also periodic challenges with new content to renew continued interest. All this has kept my motivation for daily practice unwavering. 

The way this app has responded to the needs of our culture now being transformed by the stressors of COVID, the economy, and politics is impressive. The live TPH series that was every day for an extended period of time felt(s) like a daily sanity break. I was not able to attend live or do the TPH live part everyday but I’ve incorporated its relevant material as I need it on especially hard days (we have continued full shelter in place do to family needs). 

I also really respect how the app has been made free for essential workers/first responders (widely defined). That’s the kind of community pull together needed especially right now.

I benefited greatly with both instruction and learning and defining vocabulary and the history of meditation as well as aspects of Buddhism the theory and religion fir some guests. Learning about the science from Ivy League ( Stanford counts too ;) adds the epiracle foundation my brain needs. I joined the app for free and let it go after two weeks but I let it go. 

Then, finally, at the peak of frustration with the pandemic, how poorly I was managing stress, work, politics,  I joined in a 21 day challenge. I got to meet previous guests and their BIG brains like Kristen, Sam, Angela, Alexis and Lauri Santos was even my accountability friend! I just wanted more folks on “my team”, so I joined. I COMPLETED my 21 day challenge ( I had never meditated so consistently before)  and I completed the 6 part Habits mediation course. I am more aware & I am not alone. HUGE Insights a formed that help me manage. 

I enjoy the gentle reminder that comes to my phone. The CHECK mark I see when I complete a session and the tracker that keeps reinforcing my habit and holds myself accountable. I need this right now. 

In the app, Dan and crew give the facts before the meditation . This was was built for me! I start my coffee and listen to Dan give me the backstory and content. Then, while my coffee brews, I sit. 

I truly have been reformatted. Covid is still here. Uncertainty is still here. How I choose to manage all of it- has changed. I can’t explain it, but right now, I NEED meditation to keep the wheels on the track, moving not too fast, not too slow but just right. In the event the wheels stop... we begin again. 

Thanks 10 percent crew. Keep up your innovation and linking the “typical” American to an evidence based method that at the end of the day, literally makes this world a better place to be in. No small feat.",False,BrownMom4,ten-percent-happier-meditation,992210239

I can honestly say it’s the highlight of my day availing my self of the wisdom ,humor,  and connection that Dan Harris brings to his community of followers.
I don’t “know” who else is listening and yet we have become a sangha of sorts- a group of people who has committed to making meditation a part of how we live during this unprecedented time.  I had trouble sleeping this morning so at 5:45am I listened to Dan and Jeff Warren and somehow the worry about not getting more than 6 hours of sleep is behind me and I’m more present in my body. And prepared to meet the day. You talked about humor and I related well to  how humor helps me cope with stress. We buried my mother in law yesterday at a funeral that was anything but typical. Only  8 of us were allowed to gather (in masks and gloves six foot distanced) to say goodbye. We couldn’t hug the immediate mourners. We could not shovel dirt on the casket or have shiva all of which are powerful parts of  Jewish custom. And yet we laughed standing there commenting about our creative masks. We appreciated the undertaker who acknowledged our loss.  And hours later in a moment of hysteria driving home from New Jersey to MA I noticed I had a small piece of melted chocolate in my palm somehow it missed my mouth and smeared all over the steering wheel. And I remembered our “pandemic” first aid kit and used a highly sought after anti bacterial wipe for chocolate clean up ( after licking my palm) and we laughed aloud!

Each person that ended up trying the app or a basic breathing meditation told me that it actually helped them.  All of them were dealing with a large amount of stress and anxiety and losing sleep.

While meditation isn’t a cure all and not a replacement for medical help, it is as equally important as physical activity in maintaining your health and managing stress.

It is presented in an approachable format and easily understandable.

I’m going with 3 stars only because this app has been around for a long while now and there still isn’t a native iPad app.  Running an iPhone native app on an iPad is a horrific experience (to me).

In closing I would say treat yourself/ you deserve it. I can only say if you allow your life to pass without experiencing meditation then you are shortchanging your journey as it will be better for you and everyone you come across.

REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY WELL DONE !!! It offers Deep Wisdom , Superb Instruction, and great Insights I had never learned before in other Meditation Courses ... And it is great that they have such an Amazing and Distinguished panel of Instructors with decades of experience who offer invaluable instruction to help one understand the proper way to Meditate and some tips on how to avoid getting stuck or getting discouraged in our journey to become regular meditators ... 

I especially liked that they offered some scientific data about the latest discoveries and benefits of Meditation that were fascinating and very encouraging...

Strongly recommend to all , and have encouraged my family and friends to try it also , since although I have only done the 21 Day Challenge and meditated for basically only 21 days I have already noticed improvements in my mindset and attitude toward life , I have noticed more awareness of things I do in every day life , and have noticed more patience and optimism...
Super Happy to have these benefits in such a short time , and looking forward to being a meditator for Life ... THANK YOU to all involved at Ten Percent Happier !!!

Having a guided meditation has been a big eye opening experience. When I meditate myself I feel frustrated.My monkey mind gets lost then I start again and stop finding I run out of time and Feeling like I have not accomplished anything. 
      I love the weekly podcast! 
I do not have a ton of time so this has been great quick and easy.
I can not thank you enough for having this Available. What a difference this has made!

I was initially very impressed with this app. However, when I carefully signed up for what I thought was the FREE trial level to try it out, my credit card was immediately charged $108.49 for an annual subscription AND I was also setup for automatic annual renewals. From my view, I did NOT agree to these charges.

When I looked for how to contact the app developer, I could not find ANY way to contact them on the app itself. I called Apple and requested their help in getting a refund. Instead I was charged another $108.49. I called Apple again and have been told I should see 2 refunds shortly on my card.

It can help you concentrate at your work better,  help you sleep better, and improve your relationship with yourself and others.
