5,2020-05-15 21:12:51,A non judgmental guide to a better self,False,"This app just keeps getting better and better. While using stoicism as a framework, this app has really been a way for me to practice personal reflection and awareness, cultivating better emotional wellness. Easily accessible techniques for gratitude, journaling, meditation, and breathing exercises without the pressure of any one thing being a requirement. The app guides you to those tools through a pleasant sequence without any pressure to use specific techniques. It‚Äôs so gentle. If you want to journal, then journal. If you want to meditate, then do that. And if you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs ok too. It‚Äôs totally up to you. I find tremendous value in the simple act of making these sequences a part of my daily morning and evening routine; from simply opening the app and assessing how I feel to what my priority for the day is to how productive I felt. The app now even guides personal reflection towards specific categories. If in the morning I say I‚Äôm going to focus on reading, in the evening the app will then guide me to reflect on recalling what I read that day. So simple, but so helpful. Excellent user experience, an essential part of my every day routine now.",CheeseNinjaIPA98,stoic,1312926037,
3,2021-04-20 12:43:19,Maybe I don't know how to use this app?,False,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this app. While it does ask you questions/give you prompts to get you talking about things, sometimes the questions are weird. I had one this morning, somewhere along the lines of ""what are you then, a mere body? a ration being."" And I'm staring at my screen like how do I even answer this if I don't understand the question? There's other ones that are similar and because I don't understand what it's asking me to write, sometimes I'll just put ""lol"" so I can move to the next page. Then when you're done with your questions it will ask if you feel better and mostly my answer has been no because the questions it gave me were weird. You can pick what questions you'd like to be asked everyday but none of them really jump out to me as something I'd want to answer daily besides the one sentence summary of your day but even that is whatever. I do like that it tracks your mood, would be cool to have another tracker for what is causing your mood instead of the sad to happy face scale. The quotes are cool too. I've been using the app for about 2 weeks now and I feel like maybe twice out of the 14 days, it's actually asked me something relevant. More often than not, I'm using the blank page entries instead but I could just write those in my actual journal. Perhaps this app isn't for me, but it seems to work for people.",Jay2DaNaay,stoic,1312926037,
3,2020-10-31 00:11:52,Good For Simple Journaling,False,"I am enjoying the free version of the app, (so this is coming from that point of view.) The daily prompts are repetitive but the paid version promises more ‚Äúreflective questions‚Äù and ‚Äúquotes‚Äù. (I wonder, how different could it be?) I do like the daily ‚Äúchoose your own/write your own ‚Äùmantra/saying/quote/etc.‚Äù There are quotes/reflections to use as journal prompts, if you just feel like typing. The daily mood/goal prompts kind of deter me away from using the app. It almost seems like a chore, mostly because not every answer for the ‚Äúmood/goal‚Äù question warrants the next prompt which is usually,  the exact same question about what we plan to do about such-and-such from the previous answers. Everything is predictable. Most of the time I just find myself lumping my thoughts into the closest category, or rushing by multiple prompts to get to the writing part and find I am uninspired. This has app has potential but I feel there are two different ideas clashing here. I love inspiration when I want to write something, but if I want to journal purely for self-reflection and self/improvement I‚Äôd like a little more depth, less out-of-context quotes from other people. Either way, there was a lot of work put into this, and a need for it too!",SilenceRecited,stoic,1312926037,

It‚Äôs iconic honestly. Not to forget the fact that it‚Äôs been lifting burdens and weights off of my back when I type everything in details. It‚Äôs like a friend that I‚Äôve always wanted, which is sad because none of my real (alive) friends are there for me and asks me how I am like how stoic isü•≤ Ever since the app asked me the first question, I‚Äôve poured allllll of the things I wanted to say and in details too.

5,2020-11-24 01:18:05,This is an amazing app,False,"I typically do not like journaling on my phone however, I stumbled upon this app and gave it a try and I absolutely love it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to buy a membership but I did because I wanted to have full access to the entire app to be able to really see if it was worth it. So far, I have used the app in the morning and evening. I wanted to be able to track my mood to get a good sense of what really bothers me and be able to journal. I find that it really helps me find peace and be able to find happy moments in my day when it is hard to find sometimes. I love being able to find ways to be grateful and this really helps me find those moments in the day when you‚Äôve been so stressed and all you can think of is the negative parts and then turning it around to find those moments that stand out that are positive. Even during times of stress I have been able to see the positive. I‚Äôve been able to take a step back and really look at each situation as a learning experience and sometimes it is hard to do when you are battling depression, anxiety and PTSD. Definitely recommend this app!!",Chryssee,stoic,1312926037,
5,2020-01-21 06:17:13,Try This App,False,"As a philosophy student and a productivity nerd, I‚Äôve probably tried somewhere over 20 different journaling apps over the years and nothing has ever felt complete enough to make it worth the time. Within my first sit down with this app however, I actually found myself crying in some moments and smiling at others, ultimately feeling like I had done something truly productive. This app is incredibly in-depth and really delivers a guided experience that is tailored for your personal goals. It is structured enough to feel like you know what to do in order to benefit from it, and it is open-ended enough to feel like you don‚Äôt need any other app to accompany it, which makes it feel very complete and satisfying to have everything in one place. The customizable options, philosophical quotes and questions, and the array of mental exercises to choose from make this app an excellent tool to heal and grow. I have no doubt that this will continue to be a valued part of my daily routine, and I urge anyone reading this to try this for yourself!",AustinCorn,stoic,1312926037,
5,2020-04-16 12:23:18,Making a difference,False,"I‚Äôve been struggling with depression and anxiety all my life. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable w personal counseling, which I have tried.  I‚Äôve read multiple self help books ranging from CBT to The Power of now, all incrementally helped and gave me short term motivation but I lacked discipline.  I also have and continue to use Youper for on demand emotional assist.  Mornings are the worst for me. At times I am woken by anxiety. When it‚Äôs bad I force myself to cry before leaving the house because I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong but I know crying helps.  This app has made the most difference so far- I‚Äôve only used it for 2 weeks.  It‚Äôs the first thing I do when I wake up. I don‚Äôt check mail or social, I brew my coffee and start w Stoic. The daily quotes are great weather I chose to reflect on them or not. Having to write/pause/set goals puts me in a whole different head space before my day actually starts. Today I woke up not anxious and looking forward to Stoic asking me -do you feel prepared for the day? So far the Answer has been Yes",nickname?geez,stoic,1312926037,

I tried social media but, this is rather private. yk? 
then I decided one day to just download this. I looked through the reviews, figured whatever let‚Äôs try it. 
the first two days, I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the app although once I became adjusted to the app‚Äôs algorithm and was it‚Äôs formatted: I enjoy it. I do, I would love a bit more personalization but that‚Äôs just me. it‚Äôs just a bonus I‚Äôd like. (although I love the app‚Äôs dark / soft theme.

5,2020-06-24 17:37:07,"Life Changing App, Love It.",False,"I rarely write reviews for apps, but when I do so it‚Äôs either because I hate it and had to express that, or love it (which is the option here). I‚Äôm extremely impressed. Like seriously. I‚Äôve been going through a lot mentally and emotionally the past several weeks, and this is like having a personal journal to jot down your ideas, thoughts, and to help silence your mind from those scrambling thoughts floating around in your head. Everything was well thought out, I love the minimalistic yet elegant approach in terms of the UI and how helpful it is to help pull any and/or every thought out of your head to help guide you to being more present and self aware of what you‚Äôre feeling, how you‚Äôre feeling, etc. I loved it so much I subscribed for the yearly plan (with the free trial of course so I can see what additional benefits I‚Äôll get). The mantras are amazing and they help set the tone of the day! Much love, I‚Äôm a fan.",Pootoo88,stoic,1312926037,
5,2021-01-25 20:15:12,Absolutely Incredible - Better than Others,False,"Absolutely incredible. The focus breathing, the journaling, and the adaptability to each user.

Now, this journaling app is incredible. I write 3-5 times a day and use its focus breathing exercises so much. This is the only app I want to actually support with money even though I am a stingy person.

‚Äî‚Äî

Update: I do dislike the new feature where it asks you to think negatively to become grateful without being able to decline like last update. For those who are suffering depression, anxiety, and other mental issues, this is a big black hole that one can go into. I plead the developers to lock this feature away by being able to decline before the app asks you that question.",NemoTheCat,stoic,1312926037,"{'id': 20686361, 'body': 'hey,\n\ncould you please ping me at m@stoicroutine.com so we could find the issue with forcing negative visualization? \n\nthere should be an option to skip it but i worry we messed it up.\n\nbest,\nmaciej', 'modified': '2021-01-27T12:52:23Z'}"
5,2021-04-20 16:20:19,This is the app I needed.,False,"This is the app I needed. I‚Äôve been looking for this for a long time.  What I‚Äôm here to treat: Bipolar Disorder 1, ADD, Anxiety and Relationship problems.

Why I have failed with past apps and what this one gets right

1) Clutter/Non-optimal design

Due to my extreme sensitivity and need for minimalism, other apps with their colors and complex menus were usually too much.

This one is white one black. Perfect.
Journal history view is scroll-only with effective use of emoji to efficiently encode the information. Perfect.

2) Need multiple apps

By way of illustration, prior to finding this app, I was using and paying for multiple apps featuring breathing exercises and CBT, to name a couple. A dedicated breathing exercise app may still be desirable for you, but if you‚Äôre easily overwhelmed such that the prospect of needing multiple apps will increase your chances of failure, know that this app contains breathing exercises and guided meditations alongside the best-in-class CBT, in my opinion.  Perfect.

3) Daily commitment feels to complicated or involved.

Many apps make me dizzy with what they want me to do to get better.  This one asks me to select a minimal drawing of a mouth to indicate my mood, quotes a stoic philosopher to inspire me and then gives me the option of what I want to do from there, while first gently encouraging me to journal by prompting a conversation.  Perfect.",Daniel the Greek,stoic,1312926037,

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I‚Äôd say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don‚Äôt mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That‚Äôs only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.",Raimabird,stoic,1312926037,"{'id': 20357398, 'body': 'could you check what hour you have in ‚Äöyour profile‚Äô -> personalize -> start day at?\n\nbest,\nm.', 'modified': '2021-01-12T22:23:35Z'}"
5,2021-02-09 00:02:49,The perfect app for my daily journaling needs,False,"I feel a deep debt of gratitude to the makers of this app. I feel as if I‚Äôve been searching for just the right journaling app and this one feels like coming home to the one made just for me. I am remembering back to the time around eleven years ago when I was jumping around between different Buddhist groups trying to find where I fit in before finally feeling at home with a Zen/Ch‚Äôan Buddhist group in Colorado. Anyways, to get back on the toping of Journaling. As I‚Äôve been exploring my inner self through meditative practices, I‚Äôve found journaling more and more useful. I‚Äôve also discovered practices such as Stoicism that have been very helpful too. This app seems to combine  meditative breathing exercises, with Zen and Stoic philosophy and also to be great at guiding the individual to emotional well being. Thanks for making such a great app!",JRBel,stoic,1312926037,
4,2021-01-10 15:16:09,"Excellent, with Some Minor Things",False,"I‚Äôve tried a lot of apps like Stoic. and it‚Äôs unquestionably the best, and the only one I‚Äôve consistently stuck with. It‚Äôs simple but comprehensive and powerful. I love it, and use the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch versions daily to very positive effect.

My only critique is that sometimes the morning and evening question prompts will include questions that are very similar (‚Äúhow do you plan to spend the rest of today?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you plan to do today?‚Äù in the morning) and/or outright repeat questions (often ‚Äúwhat made you smile today?‚Äù in the evening). I suspect that I could avoid this by selecting/customizing my questions, but I like the sometimes unique questions that pop up and worry that if I don‚Äôt let the app decide, my experience with that feature of the app will stagnate. However, it is sometimes disruptive to the flow to have the same or similar question come up again.",grievedghost,stoic,1312926037,
5,2020-12-29 20:02:03,Has truly helped with my mental health,False,"This app is the best app for mental health. It‚Äôs very relaxing and truly makes me feel calm and at ease. I love how the morning questions map out your day and how the evening questions help you reflect on the good and bad that happened during your day. As for the exercises themselves, they have helped with gratefulness, fears, and stress, and have really helped with my problems.

The only problem I have is with the affirmation widget. I click on the add affirmation button on the widget and it just opens the app to the main screen. I really hope you guys can fix this as I really like the affirmation widget.

Overall, I would totally recommend this app. I have recommended it to a couple of family members, and they all enjoy it as well. I just hope the affirmation widget gets fixed.",12CatLady12,stoic,1312926037,
5,2020-07-13 17:19:16,Helpful for apathy and feeling stuck,False,"I‚Äôm feeling a general lack of motivation and low-key depression, but wasn‚Äôt sure what to do about it. I was looking at some of the virtual therapist apps at first glance they looked pretty I structured. Instead I got this app on a recommendation from a friend and I‚Äôm glad I did. 

It encourages me to reflect on what my priorities are daily and make a better plan for how to meet them. I find it gentle and non-judgemental but is still increasing my focus and sense of accomplishment because I set priorities and meet them, even if they‚Äôre very small. It also helps me celebrate days where my explicit focus is to relax. Or see friends. Or just clean the house a bit. This app helps me see that as a valid goal I met rather than ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù. Would recommend for people who like a structured reflective approach.",cjspurg,stoic,1312926037,
5,2020-05-01 03:58:23,Worth it.,False,"All in all, this Stoic Journal has been very helpful for me. It‚Äôs helped me to control my anger - with the breathing and the thought exercises.

It‚Äôs given me the space to think about how my mind and body work together. I‚Äôve also gained insight into myself with the trends. I‚Äôve spotted patterns in my mood and fulfillment levels. I‚Äôve been able to course correct. I‚Äôve begun to build a ritual of starting and ending the day with this app. It‚Äôs honestly made my life better. Of course it is just a tool. It‚Äôs not magic.

5,2020-09-21 13:25:40,Incredible,False,"I downloaded this app because I was feeling especially down one day, and I didn‚Äôt even take it seriously. I just thought I‚Äôd use it for a few days to journal and then forget about it like the other apps.
But then I actually opened it and used it and I kid you not, from that very next day there was a change in the way I thought about things and a change in me!
It was crazy too because those questions that it asked me made me think so deeply, that the next day when I was about to go right back to that terrible habit of thinking everyone hates me, I stopped myself.
I‚Äôve been using it every day since and I love it. I‚Äôm so so glad I gave it a real chance too because the amount that you put into this is exactly the amount you get back.",SoliyanaW,stoic,1312926037,

It has a lot of options for improving mental health, like journaling, focusing on goals, fear settings, meditation, etc. It‚Äôs been super helpful in helping me prioritize things in life. Also, the fear setting section, might even be the most helpful, it analysis‚Äô your fears and helps you get to the root of it and how to solve it. Like my main fear, which I‚Äôm not going to share, but it helped after one entry. And best of all, it‚Äôs free! I realized that I have trouble sharing my feelings and internal struggles with others, which is why therapy would be difficult for me, but this app helps me cope with it on my own terms.

To my surprise, this app has been nothing but helpful and inspiring. I use it every morning and every evening reflecting on my day and starting my morning off with positive energy. In a time like ours, it is so easy to be pessimistic about...well everything! But when I use this app first thing in the morning it reminds me to remember the small things and focus on what we DO have, rather than what we DON‚ÄôT.

Takes real texts from real stoic philosophers, has an array of options for you to log your feelings, emotions, actions, etc. And it encourages you to question the things you do, if you follow the exercises, and stick with this app, but not only that but the PHILOSOPHY of stoicism.

2. I would also love to see some quotes from women. I know there weren‚Äôt too many stoic philosophers who were women at the time.. but I see that you also have Buddhist and Catholic quotes.

That‚Äôs how I came across this apps. Skeptical at first, I downloaded this thinking I‚Äôd be bombarded with complex interface, fifty things to try, constantly chime and alert, and be the opposite of what it wants me to be. But stoic wasn‚Äôt like those apps. It is simple, non-intrusive, makes you do your thing and gets out of your way. 

The app wants you to check-in twice a day. Everyday I‚Äôm reading an inspiring quote that reminds me to focus in the now, and live by the breath, while being appreciative of what I have. It also tracks my moods and over time will likely share insights about me (I assume). The app interaction takes but a few minutes and leaves you wanting a bit more. I like how it leaves you at that edge.

I have been using this journal (almost daily) for just over 2 weeks now and I am loving it.

It is assumptions like this one (eg you want to change the mantra daily vs say work with it for a week) that also limits the usefulness of the app.

I love the daily questions, which makes it easier to journal three times a day. Instead of just a blank screen. 

The only thing that keeps me from buying lifetime access are three things:

1. A more evolved journal. Would be nice to have a more dedicated journal with calendar and tags to easily go back to what I have written or felt before. 

2. More stoicism content, like articles, podcasts, reflections, etc. 

3. More quotes by modern stoics. I usually get daily quotes by Epictetus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius and keep repeating themselves after a couple of days.

stoic asks you a couple questions at the beginning and end of your day, and based on the answers and time available, recommends you something calming to do (breathing exercise, meditation, quotes to read, etc.).
You can also set goals for your day and journal whenever you want to.

5,2020-09-12 07:01:09,Excellent attention to detail,False,"I bumped into Stoic accidentally, when I was browsing App Store Stories, and after I became intrigued by its inspirations (i.e. Ancient Greek and Roman Stoicism) and its pretty graphics I downloaded it on a whim. To my real surprise, I loved it! I think what sets it apart from other journaling and mood-tracking apps (I‚Äôve found no alternative that I can like as much as Stoic, and believe me, I have tried) is 1) its structural simplicity and coherence and 2) its honesty and its nonjudgemental tone. You never feel like the app is pushing you to feel a certain way, because it seems like it‚Äôs just giving you tools to help you understand yourself; the routines it suggests seem to cleverly adapt to how much effort you feel like putting in that day; and I never once felt like it was trying to press me or trick me into paying money (I bought premium anyway). The developer has clearly put thought into the app‚Äôs design, and it shows.

I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this app mature. One personal suggestion I have for it is that I think personalisation of routines could allow for a little more flexibility. I bought the subscription partly out of a desire to support the development of the app, and partly because I wanted to customise the morning and evening routines. In particular, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the ‚Äòwhat is your main focus today?‚Äô and the ‚Äòhow did you feel today?‚Äô questions, mostly because they usually don‚Äôt offer answer options that suit me. I realise there‚Äôs quite a bit of structure (follow-up questions, trend tracking etc.) built around the answers to those questions, but I was hoping I could write my own questions for the morning/evening routines and choose arbitrarily which parts of the default routine I want to keep. (Custom questions wouldn‚Äôt have to have functionality like generating new questions and contributing to the trends tracker‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy if I could write my own non-adaptive text and multiple choice questions.) Making it possible to add and delete answer options in the ‚Äòwhat is your main focus today?‚Äô and ‚Äòhow did you feel today?‚Äô questions is another option, and I have a feeling a lot of people would like to see that happen.

In summary: really good app, and I hope it preserves the principles of forthrightness and attention to detail that I‚Äôve come to appreciate seeing in all its design decisions. I hope it grows a community going forward, and I‚Äôd love to be a part of it.",tunefulTriangulist,stoic,1312926037,

More than anything, it feels like mine. I genuinely feel a connection to it. This isn‚Äôt like most journaling apps, where it‚Äôs designed to let you write things and has other functions hidden behind a paywall. You‚Äôre allowed to see how your mood has changed. You can go back and see what you‚Äôve written. There are guided meditations and mini self-care sessions available at a single touch. It‚Äôs been integral in helping me understand myself more. I‚Äôve been in therapy for a while, and my mother used to be a therapist, so I‚Äôve grown up in a very open household, and I can genuinely say that this feels like a comforted, guided experience. I am allowed to be myself here, and I love that so much is open for absolutely no cost. You can feel the dedication and time and effort that was put into making this project as good as it could possibly be. I feel motivated to wake up and record my thoughts, and winding down with a brief journaling session helps me to clear my mind. It can be so difficult when you have a mental illness to take that first step, but this app really, really helps. I‚Äôm able to record what I‚Äôm thinking and feeling, and it helps me to process that. The techniques used in the journaling process help me to identify flawed ideals that I hold, and I‚Äôm able to correct my thinking on my own time.

5,2020-05-24 01:17:26,THE BEST GUIDED JOURNALING APP OUT THERE,False,"just... wow. I have tried a LOT of different journaling apps. some super minimalistic, some packed with features and prompts and graphs etc. I struggle with a lot of executive dysfunction, and I was never able to stick to any of these apps because it felt too much like a chore. The apps WORKED fine, but they were just designed the wrong way‚Äî feature packed from a content-first perspective. But this app feels like it takes a totally different approach‚Äî a user-first perspective. It‚Äôs not about feeling something and then writing it down, it‚Äôs about writing things down to identify and process how you‚Äôre feeling ‚Äî if that makes any sense.
From a UI/UX perspective‚Äî i have NO WORDS. It‚Äôs just stunning. Like if I had to pick one app out of all the ones i‚Äôve used, journaling or not‚Äî this one is easily the winner. It‚Äôs just so beautiful and smooth and intuitive. And the UI for the breathing exercises is just *chefs kiss*. I also love the specific breathing exercises you included‚Äî these breath patterns aren‚Äôt random, but scientifically backed to help you relax/wake up etc. The 8-7-4 one helps you switch to the parasympathetic nervous system for example. 
And regarding the overall design of the app‚Äî also just amazing. The way it asks me questions and suggests exercises for me is really genius and removes one of the big barriers in journaling‚Äî figuring out what to write. Because in this app, it isn‚Äôt about figuring out what to write ‚Äî it‚Äôs about figuring out how you feel (by writing it down. or breathing. or visualization.) 
Anyway, major thanks to the devs and creators and everyone else on the team for making a really amazing app that is making such a positive impact on my life and helping me become more mindful and more aware of my emotions, and which overall just has made it easier to be alone with just my thoughts.",rubyyy‚ú®,stoic,1312926037,

5,2020-02-01 07:23:52,My Favorite App On My Phone,False,"I‚Äôve always wanted a good journaling app, and it almost feels like this one was designed for me. From the different functionalities, to the color scheme and minimalism, to the focus on mindfulness, this is my perfect app. It is the perfect addition to my day. It‚Äôs also an amazing competitor for many of the more popular journaling apps that paywall everything. Honestly, I can‚Äôt believe such a beautiful app has as much unpaid content as it does. It‚Äôs truly a testament to the character of the developer. I can‚Äôt wait to see the updates to come. I will note a few bugs I‚Äôm experiencing just so the developer can know, but I want to point out that these do not in any way change the enjoyment of use. 

They are as follows:
-sometimes my day will change in the app even though it hasn‚Äôt yet hit my set time for it to do that (but let me also commend that it allows you to pick the time that it rolls over. An amazing feature for nightowls like me)
-I only ever get quotes from Seneca despite having all three quote philosophies turned on
-I selected certain questions to appear every morning and night but they haven‚Äôt been consistently

I particularly wanted to point out the bugs I was having because of how fantastic I think each of those features are if the bugs go away. I‚Äôd also love to see the meditation portion become a bit more guided. Overall though, five stars isn‚Äôt high enough for what this app deserves. It‚Äôs truly my favorite app on my phone, and the only one I can honestly say makes me feel better after using it. If this app ever does start charging, I‚Äôll pay whatever they want.

5,2020-05-05 14:15:51,Amazing,False,"I suffer from a lot of mental and crazy crap from military. This app has helped me more than anything. It has all the physiological things you need to practice to calm down, practice mental health etc. you can journal, do visualizations, meditation, all with guidance and getting to specific roots of problems your going thru. And now days a lot of guys love stoic ways literally so it‚Äôs very incorporated hoping all the practices and exercises in this app. I need to keep my emotional and mental health in check because I am a struggling entrepreneur and I work with a lot of other entrepreneurs. This app is good for literally doing exercises that are actually in stoic philosophy to grow and overcome life with mental sturdiness. 

I actually feel better when something stressful happens and I 
Open this app and it helps break down the whole situation and work thru it. The different exercises help you work thru various situations. Kind of like different ways to help you untangle certain knots you have. 
The simple easy UI design with dark colors etc of the app is important for stoic theme and calming.  

Overall I‚Äôm impressed. This is best ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù app (waaaaay more than that tho) maybe mostly for guys? It‚Äôs worth the yearly subscription of $37. 

However since it is so awesome and costs money please keep improving this app. Because of the current benefits of this app I am very excited to experience the ways the creators will keep improving and upgrade it. 

I hope it can just be a much bigger app in terms of more intricate and deeper stoic exercises. 

There are actually a handful of apps I use daily and this is definitely one of them.",Dmceb,stoic,1312926037,
4,2020-09-18 13:23:24,"Love the app, just needs some minor improvements",False,"Been using Stoic since I discovered it earlier this year, and overall I absolutely love it, I've stuck with it and it really helps me put my day and my life in order and perspective. The look of the app is gorgeous, the functionality is smooth, and I really do feel more prepared for my day after doing my morning routine, and the evening routine helps me go to bed with a clear head. 

That all said, there's one thing that annoys the heck out of me that I really hope the devs will be able to fix (and given how well they've handled adding new features and improving the app regularly, I'm sure this is something they can do): Often, especially during the morning routines, I will get repeat questions. For example, the app will ask me 'How do you plan to spend your day?', and then immediately or one or two questions later, it will ask 'What are you planning to do today?'. Or, like this morning, it asked me to list things I am grateful for today, and then immediately after asked me again to list 3 things I am grateful for. 

I realize the questions are triggered by the things we mark down as our focus for each day, and some of them may apply to multiple categories, but being asked the same question multiple times when I've already answered it for the day really annoys me and takes me out of my relaxed and focused mindset. If that could be fixed, so that you don't get the same or very similar questions in the same session, or at the very least some kind of indicator whether a question was triggered by, say, 'work' and then a similar question was triggered by 'reading' or 'learning', so that I can tailor my answers to those specific topics of focus, that would immediately elevate my rating to 5 stars. 

Other than that, *love* the app, and really hopeful that this slight annoyance will be fixed.",UncivilizedDan,stoic,1312926037,
