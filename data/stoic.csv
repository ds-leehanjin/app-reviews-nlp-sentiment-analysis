"I'm not really sure how I feel about this app. While it does ask you questions/give you prompts to get you talking about things, sometimes the questions are weird. I had one this morning, somewhere along the lines of ""what are you then, a mere body? a ration being."" And I'm staring at my screen like how do I even answer this if I don't understand the question? There's other ones that are similar and because I don't understand what it's asking me to write, sometimes I'll just put ""lol"" so I can move to the next page. Then when you're done with your questions it will ask if you feel better and mostly my answer has been no because the questions it gave me were weird. You can pick what questions you'd like to be asked everyday but none of them really jump out to me as something I'd want to answer daily besides the one sentence summary of your day but even that is whatever. I do like that it tracks your mood, would be cool to have another tracker for what is causing your mood instead of the sad to happy face scale. The quotes are cool too. I've been using the app for about 2 weeks now and I feel like maybe twice out of the 14 days, it's actually asked me something relevant. More often than not, I'm using the blank page entries instead but I could just write those in my actual journal.

"Absolutely incredible. The focus breathing, the journaling, and the adaptability to each user. I have never seen such an app before.

Update: I do dislike the new feature where it asks you to think negatively to become grateful without being able to decline like last update.

"This is the app I needed. I‚Äôve been looking for this for a long time.  What I‚Äôm here to treat: Bipolar Disorder 1, ADD, Anxiety and Relationship problems.

Why I have failed with past apps and what this one gets right

1) Clutter/Non-optimal design

Due to my extreme sensitivity and need for minimalism, other apps with their colors and complex menus were usually too much.

This one is white one black. Perfect.
Journal history view is scroll-only with effective use of emoji to efficiently encode the information. Perfect.

2) Need multiple apps

By way of illustration, prior to finding this app, I was using and paying for multiple apps featuring breathing exercises and CBT, to name a couple. A dedicated breathing exercise app may still be desirable for you, but if you‚Äôre easily overwhelmed such that the prospect of needing multiple apps will increase your chances of failure, know that this app contains breathing exercises and guided meditations alongside the best-in-class CBT, in my opinion.  Perfect.

3) Daily commitment feels to complicated or involved.

Many apps make me dizzy with what they want me to do to get better.  This one asks me to select a minimal drawing of a mouth to indicate my mood, quotes a stoic philosopher to inspire me and then gives me the option of what I want to do from there, while first gently encouraging me to journal by prompting a conversation.

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I‚Äôd say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don‚Äôt mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That‚Äôs only a request, not a complaint though!

"I feel a deep debt of gratitude to the makers of this app. I feel as if I‚Äôve been searching for just the right journaling app and this one feels like coming home to the one made just for me.

Anyways, to get back on the toping of Journaling. As I‚Äôve been exploring my inner self through meditative practices, I‚Äôve found journaling more and more useful.

My only critique is that sometimes the morning and evening question prompts will include questions that are very similar (‚Äúhow do you plan to spend the rest of today?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you plan to do today?‚Äù in the morning) and/or outright repeat questions (often ‚Äúwhat made you smile today?‚Äù in the evening). I suspect that I could avoid this by selecting/customizing my questions, but I like the sometimes unique questions that pop up and worry that if I don‚Äôt let the app decide, my experience with that feature of the app will stagnate.
