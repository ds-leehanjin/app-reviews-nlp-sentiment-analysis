Favorite Self-care App,SolitaryBridge,5,False,2020-03-27 13:09:49,"I‚Äôve had this app since Beta-testing it a few years ago. I don‚Äôt typically use apps like this because most don‚Äôt seem to have real direction or a variety that fits. I let this one sit for a bit before coming back to it during a stressful period, and I was pleasantly surprised! I like that I can extend my tracks now considering I don‚Äôt come back here everyday, and the personalization is dead on for me! It goes hand in hand with where I‚Äôve needed to grow yet lacked a clue where to start. My therapist very much approved too! I‚Äôve since ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù trauma-informed therapy, and this app has helped me in moments I‚Äôve needed to simply be reminded of my newer mental toolbox. It doesn‚Äôt overstep any spiritual boundaries for me either (I‚Äôm a pastor). Thanks!!!",happify-for-stress-worry,730601963,
