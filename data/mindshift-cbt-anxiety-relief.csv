False,antoniastam,4,2020-09-07 22:48:18,Increased Interconnectivity,"MindShift claims that it is geared toward adolescents, and therefore, its functionality and appropriateness should be evaluated through the psychosocial development of adolescents. According to Laser (2010), it is important for adolescents to have an ample vocabulary to be able to identify their emotions beyond “tired” or “fine.” Adolescents experience complicated emotions during this time of life, and it is crucial that they are able to identify and name these feelings, especially so they can have control over their behaviors and learn to self-regulate. MindShift does a fine job of supporting this necessary development of adolescence, as it provides the user with an in-depth list of emotions tied to their anxiety and specific symptoms they may be experiencing. While MindShift allows users to share progress with whomever they please, it does not allow for interaction among users. According to a recent study conducted through a social media website for adolescents with depression and anxiety, one of the most liked features was the ability to write on blog posts and see positive quotes and stories (Radovic, 2018). Adolescents oftentimes use social media to feel connected to one another, therefore, MindShift should consider enabling a feature that allows adolescents struggling with anxiety to share their stories with each other.",mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825,
False,carlyfisher,4,2020-09-08 16:57:29,MindShift CBT review!,"After reviewing and critiquing MindShift CBT, I rank the app a 4 out of 5. While the app has many strengths such as providing a simple and user friendly preface that allows its users to very easily use it as a positive tool, I feel that if there was a social aspect with the app, it would attract more users. Especially given that the adolescent population thrives off of forming connections and having a social network. MindShift CBT is very informative without being intimidating or overwhelming. I feel if the app incorporated additional videos and/or other visuals, it would be more appealing to adolescents as the app is primarily filled with just text. Many adolescents are visual learners and this is a weakness I see within the app. I would highly recommend this app to adolescents I plan to work with in the future as well as recommend it to adults looking for another outlet to help explore their own anxiety and mental health.",mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825,

False,Lauren897,5,2020-11-13 19:47:52,Useful App,"I found the MindShift app to be simple yet useful. I have used this app for about a month. I find it valuable to monitor how I have been feeling each day. It is hard to keep track of how I am feeling as there are fluctuations everyday. However, MindShift keeps a record of how I have ranked my anxiety for the last week. This allows for me to visualize my shifting levels of anxiety throughout the week. This way I am able to identify patterns in my week and see if there are any days that consistently cause me any worries. I can also use this app to write down a description as to what is happening in my life that causes the degree of my anxiety. I think it is interesting to go back to this. In many ways, one could use this as a virtual diary. 
In addition to the monitoring of levels of anxiety, the app works to spread information about general worry, social anxiety, perfectionism, panic, and phobias. For example there is a whole section dedicated to common general worries and some ways to cope with excessive worry. In one of my psychology classes, we have learned about generalized anxiety disorder. Many of the common worries for the future that are seen in the disorder involve school, health and safety of others, and unknown things. This app also lists these worries and gives a brief description of how these worries may appear. This app is by no means a way to diagnose oneself, but it does give nice background information. The descriptions are comprehensible and not too overwhelming. 
We also learned that exposure therapy is one effective method of treatment for anxiety in the class. In the app, it encourages one to “sit on” some of the little worries we have because we cannot control everything. It mentions that one should not avoid everything that gives them anxiety. While this is not exactly exposure therapy in a controlled setting with a professional, it may be useful for those that are struggling with their worry, but it is not serious enough to seek professional help. It may provide a baby step that people need in managing some of their anxiety. 
Another example is that the app discusses social anxiety. It describes how people may have anxiety when only speaking in public. I learned about this in my class as performance-only anxiety. It also talks about social anxiety not just in certain settings. In class, I learned about social anxiety as a disorder. It does not touch on the disorder itself but some instances where people will avoid social situations because it gives them some feelings of anxiety. In addition to their descriptions, it encourages one to face their social fears and challenge the negative thoughts associated with social anxiety. This is also related to what I learned in class because (again) exposure is a form of treatment. The app is simple and it does not overreach. Additionally, it does not give unrealistic claims such as curing anxiety. It seems pretty reasonable. 
Of course seeking professional help is most likely the best option for people that are seriously struggling, but this app acts as a good first step to introductory lessons on anxiety. Additionally, it is a good resource to keep track of one’s anxiety. If someone wanted to take a step in self care in seeing tracking their anxiety, I would recommend this app. Therefore, I really enjoyed this app as it is basic, simple to use, convenient, and straightforward.",mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825,

False,skary1ja,4,2020-10-08 19:17:07,App review,"This app claims to be a CBT centered app for anxiety disorders and I think that claim is pretty true to the content. Two main components of cognitive-behavioral therapy are exposure and cognitive reconstructing. This app does a really good job of including both of those elements. As far as exposure therapy goes, the section ‘taking action’ offers a really detailed activity for scheduling activities to face your fears and anxieties. There are reasonable examples and options to create stepping stones instead of diving straight in. The coping cards are really good for cognitive restructuring, as they allow you to put negative or overwhelming thoughts into better perspective. The daily mood check is another tool that helps you become mindful of your thoughts and feelings, which is a good starting place when determining what thoughts need to be restructured. The only problem with this app is that it doesn’t encompass all anxiety disorders. There is no segment for people who suffer from OCD or PTSD. There are still great tools on the app that will benefit everyone, but creating segments for the different anxiety disorders and not including all subtypes feels invalidating. Overall, this app is a really good everyday tool to help with some anxiety disorders, however definitely not meant to replace traditional therapy. I think it is mostly successful with mindfulness. Becoming aware of your thoughts and having resources to calm you down if you are stressed is always a nice tool to have available.",mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825,

False,christopherMSW,4,2020-01-30 03:29:46,A great app resource to help manage anxiety,"USABILITY
1.     Basic functionality: The app MindShift  is designed to be a free, interactive cognitive-based online anxiety tool. MindShift uses “scientifically proven strategies” based on CBT principles to help users learn about anxiety, how to relax and be mindful, develop more effective ways of thinking, and take active steps to manage anxiety symptoms. It is meant to help persons cope with mild to moderate anxiety. The app provides basic information about CBT as well as the various types of anxiety-related issues, including “worry, panic, perfectionism, social anxiety, and phobias.” Interactive CBT features help users “reorient [their] thinking” and raise awareness around behavioral strategies that can raise awareness about anxiety and steps one can take to cope and work toward positive change. Features include: Quick Relief (for “fast” anxiety strategies); Thought Journal (where user can record and log unhelpful thoughts); Coping Cards (flashcards that help person “ride out anxiety”); Belief Experiments (create customizable experiments that help person test out beliefs that fuel anxiety); Facing Fears (helps users make small steps toward overcoming fears); Expanding Your Comfort Zone (confidence building feature); Chill Zone (audio recordings of guided relaxation and mindfulness meditations); Check-In (user can record and keep track of anxiety and mood over time with graphs and journal entries); Healthy Habits (tips and tricks that cultivates self-care); and Goal Setting (tools and tips to help person accomplish life goals). 
2.     Age group: On the app store the age rating is 4+, but it appears to me that, in general, it is best geared toward those who have reached at least a 5th grade level of cognitive-emotional awareness and understanding. The language used in the examples and concepts provided presume a certain level of abstract thought, which those younger than 13 years of age may not readily understand. For example, in the explanation of “Where does anxiety come from?” in the apps “Learn” section, it says: “Anxiety problems can be passed on genetically. That means, if someone in your family…has had problems with anxiety, then you might be more likely to develop anxiety problems.” This could be confusing to younger persons who have not graduated yet from concrete to more abstract thought. 
3.     Simplicity and ease of use. MindShiftis easy to use. Set-up required limited basic information including name, birth year, country and state, and email address. Icons with features are easily identifiable. It may take several uses to remember the features within features. For example, it took me a while to remember where the “Thought Journal” was. The app does not have pop-ups or ads, which is important for an app that is designed to minimize anxiety and find respite from distractions. 
4.     Playfulness. The app is not particularly meant to entertain, but nevertheless does a great job engaging through a good balance of interactive features (E.g., the home screen includes a quick check-in feature with a sliding 5-point “scale” from “Great” to “Awful.” 
5.     Visual Design. The first iteration of MindShift came out in 2014. The last update is from November 2019, so it is up-to-date with a sleek and attractive design. Features are clearly organized and I appreciate the balance between interactive features that allows users to customize certain elements and input their own information while providing basic psychoeducation that provides enough information without overwhelming the person with information. Pictures of real persons are limited, but it does appear that most persons depicted are between 18-25 years old; from what I can tell they are all Caucasian. It would be nice to see more diversity of ages and ethnicities in the images selected. 
6.     Sound Design. The Chill Zone feature provides 9 audio recordings with relaxation and mindfulness meditation exercises. The user can select a male or female voice; the quality is high. There is no option to read the exercises, which makes it impossible for hearing impaired persons to utilize this part of the app. 7.     Interactivity. There are several interactive features in MindShift. The Thought Journal allows users to a.) journal (in 400 characters) about a situation that is worrying them and encourages reflection on reasons why, b.) choose three out of the suggested nine “thinking traps” (e.g., “catastrophizing”, “black and white thinking”, etc.) most associated situation, and c.) provides opportunity for how user might reframe the worry by journaling (in 400 characters) about ways they could “balance the thought.” Journal entries can be stored for later viewing. In the “Coping Cards” feature, users can add to the populated cards related to each manifestation of anxiety by writing their own “coping card.” In the “Belief Experiments” feature, users can test out maladaptive beliefs by selecting an area of life that makes the user particularly anxious; five life domains, including a personalized “Other”, are included as choices. For example, in choosing “School”, the user can a.) describe in 400 characters a situation that they will face (E.g., turning in an assignment), b.) in 400 characters make a prediction about the situation (E.g., “I will make mistake on paper”), and c.) schedule a calendar date when belief will be tested by. Notifications can be turned on reminding user about due date. All Belief Experiments can be marked as either upcoming or completed. Similar interactive exercises can be done in the “Comfort Zone”, “Facing Fears”, “Healthy Habits”, and “Defining Goals” features. Additionally, users can do quick check-in and rate anxiety multiple times throughout the day. A check-in summary can be generated showing the different anxiety levels for the past 14 days in a bar graph.",mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825,

False,Andrea Granados.,4,2020-01-30 16:53:02,A Social Worker Perspective...,"I found this app on an article that was published on the website called psycom.net. The author of the article was reviewing the “Top 25 Mental Health Apps for 2019: An Alternative to Therapy?” Even though I have not jumped on the bandwagon of eliminating therapy as a whole because of these latest app creations, I do think that they are a good thing to have as well as attending in person therapy sessions. The rating I give MindShift is a 4 out of 5 based on the criteria given above and my own experience with using this app. The weakness that I gravitated to the most, and that I very rarely think about, is the accessibility for people with disabilities like low vision, hearing impairments, or any other major disability. I have a brother who is on the autism spectrum and wears a prosthetic eye due to his diagnoses with cancer in one of his eyes, known as retinoblastoma. I was able to use his intellectual, physical, and emotional capabilities to see if he would be able to operate the app appropriately and effectively. It is important to keep in mind that my brother is on the higher functioning side of the autism spectrum, so, he would not have any issues navigating the actual app physically. The only concern would be is when he would have to disclose how he is doing for the day, because his answer is always “good” when anyone asks, and his understanding of what each activity is supposed to help with and do. The strengths that I was able to identify fall under the actual layout of the app and the content it given. The app lay out is easy to navigate and understand and there is no in-app purchase that pop up or linger as you try to focus on lowering your anxiety, or checking-in to keep track of your anxiety. The content within the app correlates to content that I have read about or have been told about in most of my social work classes, so, there is validity in the practices given. According to Pooja Chandrashekar, author of “Do mental health mobile apps work: evidence and recommendations for designing high-efficacy mental health mobile apps” published on the U.S National Library of Medicine argues that there is value behind mental health apps. Within the journal Chandrashekar states four recommendations that should be implemented when creating mental health apps; High patient engagement, Simple user interface (UI) and experience, Transdiagnostic capabilities, and Self-monitoring features. For high-patient engagement the apps should be engaging enough for the client to actively participate often. For simple user interface and experience the apps, especially for depression and anxiety, should be “...designed to generate a low cognitive load...”(Chandrashekar, 2018). “Transdiagnostic apps can increase patient engagement and treatment efficacy by reducing the commitment needed to interact with multiple apps for comorbid disorders” Chandrashekar states. Lastly, an effective mental health app will provide the client with the opportunity to self-identify and understand their own emotions and feelings. I believe that this app was able to appropriately address the four components Pooja Chandrashekar states in her journal.",mindshift-cbt-anxiety-relief,634684825,
False,Akakat76,3,2020-02-03 02:33:55,Helpful but can’t share,"Overall I really like the Mindshift app and find it very helpful/useful.

Please try again.” so I do but I haven’t been able to share my progress at any point in the 2+ weeks that I’ve been using the app.

Update, I’m frustrated because I still can’t share my progress with my counselor from my iPhone 7. I’ve been using this app for a couple of months now and haven’t ever been able to share my entries with my counselor.
