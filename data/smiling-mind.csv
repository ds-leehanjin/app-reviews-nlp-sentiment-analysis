"I love everything about this app itself. As an American, I seriously love the Australian accents featured in each meditation. And I immensely appreciate the services being offered for free. However, I do have one (and only one) complaint and that would be that my app crashes - quite literally - every time that I try to open it from the notification screen. By that, I mean that whenever I receive a ‚Äúyou have not meditated in ___ days, click here to do your next meditation‚Äù or a ‚Äúit is time for your daily meditation‚Äù notification and I click on the given notification to open the Smiling Mind app, the app crashes and takes my phone back to its home screen every time. If this slight bug could be addressed, I‚Äôd absolutely change my rating to a 5-star and be happy to do, and I‚Äôd officially have no complaints left. Regardless, thank you for a great app and I am a big fan of it!",Just one complaint,"{'id': 21874154, 'body': ""Hi there, thanks for the positive review. We've released a new version of the app and hopefully it's not crashing like this for you anymore!"", 'modified': '2021-03-26T02:00:54Z'}",4,The Hot Sexy Taco,2021-02-13 18:42:10,False,smiling-mind,560442518
"Having just started medical school in the US this past year, I became stressed out and started taking a negative outlook on life. I was also not treating those closest to me with the respect and love they deserved. After breaking up with my girlfriend, I decided to actually give myself time to meditate and reflect each day on who I was and how I could change. Doing Smiling Mind meditations regularly has made me more mindful of my emotions and how I don‚Äôt have to react to them immediately. I‚Äôve also enjoyed the sleep meditations because the soothing Australian accents usually knock me out before the recording is even over. Thank you guys for making this app and making it free and available for everyone",Actually changed my life!,"{'id': 22091848, 'body': 'Thank you for sharing your story!', 'modified': '2021-04-07T06:59:42Z'}",5,Joe from Wakanda,2021-03-25 01:18:27,False,smiling-mind,560442518
"I have been using Smiling Mind for about a month now and it is amazing!! It is the first completely free meditation/mindfulness app that I have found and it is very well put together. There are different sections based on who is meditating and there are so many different sections. I have done the Intro and am now doing the foundations course. This app has really allowed me to learn how to practice and incorporate mindfulness into my life even when I feel too busy to sit down and pull out the app. I think that this app is perfect for anyone who is interested in mindfulness/meditation, but doesn‚Äôt want to pay a lot like most of the other popular meditation apps!",My mind is smiling,"{'id': 22270452, 'body': 'Thanks for sharing!', 'modified': '2021-04-15T23:50:28Z'}",5,victoriaolsen1,2021-04-07 12:08:33,False,smiling-mind,560442518
"This is the best mental health/check in app I‚Äôve ever come across. I was so tired of mediation apps bombarding me with ads and the pressure to pay more for better services (it‚Äôs like.. the last thing I need when I‚Äôm trying to relax...) But Smiling Mind truly makes me feel like the people who created it actually care about the practice of mediation and not about making a buck. I find the directions to be clear and grounding, and I appreciate the wide variety of lessons and tips‚Äîthey even have a series dedicated to relieving stress during quarantine. I highly recommend this app if you struggle with anxiety and/or depression!",I love this app!,"{'id': 22091749, 'body': 'Thank you so much for this glowing review!', 'modified': '2021-04-07T06:55:49Z'}",5,Wolffjesswolff,2021-04-02 14:16:36,False,smiling-mind,560442518
"Really solid range of meditations, including developmental tools to get started with little commitment and to gradually see the benefits.  It‚Äôs been part of my routine for years.

New app has some nice enhancements and the usual bugs with a major upgrade (won‚Äôt let me change voice gender at the moment) but the apps track record on fixing such things is good.  Stick with it.  The benefits are worth the investment.","Great app, despite occasional bugs","{'id': 22091770, 'body': 'Thank you very much for the kind words!', 'modified': '2021-04-07T06:56:17Z'}",5,scryer99,2021-03-31 15:04:16,False,smiling-mind,560442518
I've used this app for a while. The content was always great the but layout/design was a bit confusing and overwhelming. Not anymore. I opened the app recently dkr the first time in a couple weeks and was excited to see a whole new design. It's a huge improvement and much easier to use. I feel like this is now on par with the big paid apps like Headspace or Calm.,Update is huge improvement,"{'id': 22581449, 'body': 'Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful review!

I was always in disarray until I have this a try. I‚Äôve always had trouble sleeping but this has specific meditations that get me right to it. Listening to one of these can change my whole day for the better. So easy to use and approachable. The one thing is I‚Äôm always told to ‚Äúfind a seat‚Äù and all that but I rarely do just out of personal preference.,Changed My Life!,"{'id': 21874279, 'body': 'Thanks for sharing your story and review!', 'modified': '2021-03-26T02:09:13Z'}",5,coconimbus,2021-03-22 05:46:21,False,smiling-mind,560442518

"Hi, when I first downloaded the app there was very limited meditation sessions in the app itself. I think it‚Äôs a good start if you want to know how to manage different areas of your life. I thinks it‚Äôs cool how it‚Äôs free but still it‚Äôs very limited I was expecting it to have more sessions in these but I guess not.. sadly one suggestion I have is to include more in the app and like get new meditation sessions everyday so that the app is fresh and we can learn more. Compared to other apps on the App Store there are a lot of meditation sessions to choose from so yeah.","Very disappointing, not worth it","{'id': 23142979, 'body': 'Thanks for the feedback.
