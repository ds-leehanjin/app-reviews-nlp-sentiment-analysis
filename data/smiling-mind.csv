"I love, love, love this app. One thing though is that the music doesn’t shut off automatically after a meditation, which is a little annoying for the sleep ones. However, the programs are great, a wonderful mix of options, and the narrator is lovely and just the right amount of guidance for my and my kiddos (9 and 11). The only changes that’d be awesome are if it integrated with health, and the dashboard showed the actual length of each day.

All that being said, meditation and mindfulness aren’t panaceas. They’re great for you and they help a lot to reduce day-to-day anxiety and manage stress, but expecting a mediation app to stop panic attacks with no other interventions is kinda like expecting jogging to fix a broken wrist. It’s not that jogging isn’t good for you or that you’re doing something wrong when you keep jogging and your wrist keeps hurting. It’s that it’s probably not the intervention you need to fix your wrist. And if your wrist is broken, or you’re suffering from panic attacks and really debilitating anxiety, you deserve the care that can help those things truly heal. Check out DBT, CBT, or the Work of Byron Katie—all interventions that can help greatly with anxiety and racing minds and integrate really well with mediation.",False,Kaytearose,2020-07-24 15:42:30,Fantastic app but not therapy,5,"{'id': 16917109, 'body': ""Thanks so much for this wonderful review!

"I love this app! I chose this app to try because of it being completely free, and I so appreciate that it is a free app for listeners. I was skeptical of meditation, but after giving this app a try, it has changed my mind. I listen to these meditations every night to help me unwind from my day and fall asleep. 
It has a great variety of programs to choose from. 
Personally, I really like that the meditation music continues to play even once the meditation ends, as it helps me to continue to relax and fall asleep without the abrupt ending. Instead of getting rid of this option, maybe have a sleep timer setting option so that listeners can choose if they want the music to continue playing or shut off immediately when the meditation ends. (Similar concept to a sleep timer that many music apps have).

"Wow, first off - this app is 100% free! No “free trials” then having to pay a ridiculous amount of money or only being able to use some tracks.  Secondly, since having traumatic brain injury, depression, and anxiety I have always heard people (medical professionals too) say “try meditation” and I just never was into it. It always bored me .. and I was a bit scared. But, with this app being absolutely no cost whatsoever, I finally get to practice and practice and go as slowly as I want and it has paid off! Even though I am new to this app, it has already done wonders for me! I have stopped taking melatonin at night to help me sleep because I always do a meditation from this app before I go to bed!

I was also not treating those closest to me with the respect and love they deserved.

"Simplicity and Use
​The app is simple to use and the feature available are easy to navigate. However, this app is not meant to be used in short spurts like scrolling through Instagram or Facebook. As previously stated, this application is about mindfulness and meditation and when practicing these, an individual needs to set aside a portion of their time to complete. The app does provide the user with the ability to see the duration of a session ahead of time, so the individual can plan accordingly.
Playfulness
​Playful is not the word I would use to describe Smiling Mind. I do think the app provides a fun and easy to use way to guide an individual through mindfulness and meditation, but using the app requires an individual to be intentional and focused, which is not always the case for applications. Many of the apps that I consider to be fun and playful do not require my complete attention like Smiling Minds.
Visual Design
​The visual design of the app is appealing, but it is not eye catching. It resembles features of other apps and lacks a distinctive visual appeal that will set it apart from other applications like Instagram or Snapchat.
Sound Design
​Sound is included in each lesson and it is necessary. The narrator is a man with an Australian accent that guides the individual through the practice for each lesson. The man is clear and easy to understand. The man’s voice cannot be changed, but I found this helpful because it provided a uniform way to navigate through the mindfulness practices. It also helped me associate his voice with mindfulness and focus more clearly on each session by not becoming distracted by a new voice. The volume of his voice can also be adjusted as needed via an individual’s volume buttons.
Social
​This app is definitely intended to be used alone. There is no social component of the app with the exception of sub users, but even this is limited. When creating an account, Smiling Mind, does give the option to use an email or Facebook, but this is the extent to which I experienced app connections. 
Interactivity
​Smiling Mind provides the user with access to their own personal data that has been tracked. Each user has a dashboard. On one’s dashboard with the number of sessions completed, meditation minutes, and user streaks via days. The dashboard also provides a bar graph of the days and length of use for users to get a visual. Lastly, the dashboard allows users to see what programs they have completed and are in the process of completing. 
Connectivity
​One does need network connection to navigate parts of the app like searching programs. However, users can download different programs and use the downloaded programs without internet. This opportunity to download and use without internet is the only way I have discovered for users to limit data usage.",False,ArtH1960,2020-09-08 12:12:47,Review from SW lens,3,"{'id': 17942789, 'body': 'Thanks for the comprehensive review!', 'modified': '2020-09-18T00:58:29Z'}",smiling-mind,560442518
"The Australian app, Smiling Mind, receives a 4.5/5 rating from me. The app was very easy to use and all the features were very clearly labeled and easy to navigate. I can appreciate the minimalistic approach to the design of this app by not overwhelming users with an abundance of tabs or features. The design of the app was professional as the color scheme was calming and pleasant to look at. The layout of the app is attractive to both adults and youth and each age program is catered to that population. Smiling Mind can be accessed through a variety of platforms making it easily accessible to anyone who is interested. The app can be downloaded on iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices. Additionally, Smiling Mind has a website that allows users to log on and access their programs via the web on a computer. The app is free and includes no in-app purchases which makes users feel more comfortable using the app without the fear of possibly being charged for something. The ability to access Smiling Mind via a computer can be especially helpful to educators, therapists, and other professionals that are working with children, adolescents, or young adults that do not have access to a smart phone. This app can particularly be helpful for adolescents and anyone that works with adolescents. According to Laser and Nicotera in their book “Working with adolescents: A guide for practitioners”, adolescents are in the stage of formal operations which means that they are able to think abstractly, creatively, and in novel ways about new and old concepts (Laser, J.A. & Nicotera, N., 2010). Adolescents would highly benefit from using this app since they could connect to the lessons taught about mindfulness and meditation in a way that was unbeknownst to them before. The excitement that adolescents feel when they discover a new cognitive ability is intellectually stimulating and very enlightening for them. 

The most impressive portion of the app was the categorization of mindfulness programs by age groups. The app features three distinct categories: youth, adult, and family programs. Within each program there are subgroups pertaining to what each individual is looking for, making this app very specific to the user. The program I was most interested in was the youth program, as I am a medical professional that works with adolescents. The youth program is divided into subgroups in increments of 2-3 years. For example, there is a 3-6 years old group, 7-9 years old, 10-12 years old, 13-15 years old, and 16-18 years old. Each of the age groups is tailored to the stage of development that the child is in. The lessons and meditation guidance recordings are done in a way that is easy for the child to understand and uses metaphors and examples that the child can relate to. The app does not receive a full 5 stars from me because of age requirements for creating an account. When registering for an account, there is no mention of a minimum age or to input one’s date of birth. It was not until I read the Privacy Policy that I learned that individuals under the age of 18 need to ask their parents or guardians for permission to create an account. An adult can create an account and add the minor as a sub-account, however, that is not explained or mentioned on the opening page of the app or in the app store. Since the app can collect personal information, it is important for the developers to make it known that users under the age of 18 need parental consent to create an account.",False,Michalina0919,2020-01-28 16:55:33,App Review from Social Work Perspective,4,"{'id': 13192651, 'body': 'Thank you so much for this extremely considerate and detailed review!
