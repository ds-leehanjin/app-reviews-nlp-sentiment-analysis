I am bringing it up to 4 stars, because it is an excellent program except for the guided meditations being so short and the narrators speaking too quickly. 

So many sounds to choose from to help soothe you that you can try a different one or different combination each day. I also appreciate the isochronic tones, which kept me coming back almost every day. The meditations are good but short.  The guides of the meditations speak very quickly and there is no option to slow their speech-if you're trying to meditate, it defeats the purpose to have to keep stopping and going back because they're talking too fast. But I bought a ""lifetime"" subscription but I have lost almost all of the sounds and meditation options I had because I don't have ""pro"" despite the fact that they have made no changes or improvements since I bought it.",2020-05-04 21:39:15,"Amazing choices for sounds, guided meditations okay",F.Ash1088,4,True,relax-meditation-guided-mind,367506176
,"I‚Äôm mostly doing a review to ask more different levels of the paid version. I don‚Äôt want/need every thing in the fancy version, there are just some sound options I wish I could have. I‚Äôd be willing to pay (reasonably) a 1 time fee to get the extra sounds. But right now the only option is a 1 yr subscription that includes a bunch of things I don‚Äôt need. Others may, and may they enjoy the option. However, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if there weren‚Äôt others who would be willing to pay a smaller 1x fee for a partial upgrade rather than the $60 for everything that only covers 1 yr. Also, would love more low pitched sound options. I rather like the brain scan sound that‚Äôs on 1 of your other apps.  Positives: really like the flexibility in this app, particularly the timer.

They‚Äôre all super super short, like one will be 7 minutes long but the program just talks for 4 minutes before you meditate for only 3 which is fine for starting out but the more advanced programs are the same way. 
There is no meditation for better sleep.

,"So I got this app around maybe two(ish) years ago and loved it. I suffered from extreme anxiety, agoraphobia and had panic attacks almost every other day. Life was pretty excruciating. After trying the sample meditations I started to notice that my attacks were coming a bit less often. I went ahead and bought the full app (that‚Äôs right, bought, not rented, not subscribed, bought, for a one time price) as well as talked my wife into trying one of their sleep/clock apps. Everything was great. Over time after meditating around the same time every day, my anxiety almost disappeared. I eventually did most of the meditations multiple times and with my anxiety not quite gone but better than it had been in years, I sat it down for a while while I waited for some new meditations. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I didn‚Äôt use the app for a long time after that, maybe 6 months or more but it never left my home screen, I never uninstalled it or anything. Eventually my anxiety started bothering me again back around Christmas so I pulled out my handy dandy anxiety busting meditation app only to find that the app that I BOUGHT for just a couple of dollars had been taken back from me and that I could now rent it BACK from them for a ridiculous amount of money a month. My progress is all still there, I‚Äôm just locked out of it. I understand the devs have a right to make money and to charge whatever they see fit. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to sell someone something only to take it back away from them and try to rent it back out to them again for thousands of more dollars. If it was to be changed I feel like the changes (a monthly subscription fee) should have only applied to people who downloaded/installed the app AFTER the decision to change it from a flat price to a subscription fee had been made and not forced upon those who had already paid for the full version. I was originally gonna leave a review around Christmas when I discovered what had happened but was just blown away and I guess hurt. I didn‚Äôt want to talk or even think of it.
