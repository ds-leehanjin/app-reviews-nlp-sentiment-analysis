Alannah S- Breath2Relax Review,5,"I downloaded this app with the hope it would help me when dealing with anxiety/stress. It helps with breathing. The app makes it so you can speed the breathing up and slow it down as well. There is a voice narrating, telling you when to breathe in and when to breathe out and the number of breathing cycles you have gone through. Very relaxing voice and helps get to sleep as well! Would recommend!!
In my Abnormal Psychology class, we learned that deep breathing relaxes, helps to relieve stress, and lower heart rate. You learn to focus on your breathing, making sure you are taking slow, deep breaths.",Lane1713,False,2020-03-24 15:59:20,breathe2relax,425720246
Straight forward,4,This is a very straight forward deep breathing application. I liked that the voices in this application weren’t computer like and there were choices for music. It is a bit hard to look at graphically but that’s not something I can’t overlook. THANK YOU for creating an app where I can adjust the breathing time. I have never liked breathing apps because I am always focused on not suffocating myself (Im not sure why but I have always had limited lung capacity) I can actually relax now that I know I’m not “breathing wrong”.,BryanaBerry,False,2020-04-27 23:47:12,breathe2relax,425720246
Never Connects to Apple Watch,3,"This is a great app that needs to be updated. I open the app on my series 4 Apple Watch and it always tells me phone not reachable and never says anything else, even while the phone is in my hands searching for the heart rate. So it becomes a bit frustrating with each use but the breathing section works very well to easily change the times for inhaling and exhaling. I would give five stars when the app actually works with my watch.",trw234,False,2021-05-11 17:30:43,breathe2relax,425720246
This app really works to relax you,5,"The proven science is that slowing your breathing relaxes you.  That’s all that’s needed to calm yourself.  Inhale and exhale when the app says to, and you will get a very nice meditative feeling.   Be sure to set the number of seconds for the inhale and the exhale; these will vary from person to person.",Mr A Magoo,False,2021-01-18 12:16:41,breathe2relax,425720246
