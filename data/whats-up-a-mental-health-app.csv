Users are give information to understand their feelings and emotions, as well as ways they can break the cycle of feeling this way. However, forums should be better controlled. Anyone can post anything, which can be hurtful to users, especially teens. Although it is said that the app is for anyone that is 4 years old and older, children that do not know how to read will not be able to use it. Individuals that are visually impaired will not be able to use it either.

An interesting point that was made by Steinberg (2014) is that the pain that adolescence experience when they are social rejected “closely resembles physical pain in neurological terms that taking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, actually can help alleviate it” (95). Being socially rejected is a painful experience for teens that can definitely make things worse for those that are already struggling. Based on the review criteria above and my own experience with What’s Up, I would rate this app a 3 out 5. What’s Up has many different coping strategies and techniques that users can access whenever they are in need of it. However, individuals can post whatever they want on the forums that can potentially harm users.",False,Cons of the Forums,3,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
2021-06-21 22:20:25,squeeegee,"The most dynamic component of this app is its active forum receiving posts from users every couple of minutes. As Murphy writes in her article on teens usage of social network sites (SNS), “SNSs can be used to help adolescents form an identity…When used correctly and monitored well by parents or adults, adolescents can effectively use SNSs to explore themselves and construct identity (Murphy, 2013, pg. 4). This particular forum site may not be the safest kind of SNS available for adolescents. The purpose of this forum is for users to chat with others experiencing struggles similar to them, and there are various categories a post can fall under like seeking advice, rant, asking for help and other but there no safeguards, like app moderators, in place currently to protect vulnerable population, like teens, from experiencing the negative side of anonymous posting. This can result in further damage being done to an adolescent’s identity formation and the learning inappropriate coping skills to dealing with their emotions.

2021-06-28 00:46:53,Kuku Cachoo,I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and this is the best app to help me calm down. It has actionable methods that it walks you through as you do them. It had great positive quotes but that’s not all the app is unlike many other anxiety apps. My favorite section is the grounding techniques that lead you through the five senses. It helps me calm down so much. Thanks so much to the creators of this app.,False,Best app for anxiety ever,5,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
2021-01-21 19:30:01,psylawn,"I was looking for a CBT app that could help me understand and cope with my intrusive BDD thoughts. Instead, I got an app full of basic platitudes and an option to journal (wow so revolutionary). The fonts are ugly, the layout is not user friendly, and the options for help are extremely limited. Go with something like Youper if you’re looking for habit/mood tracking, because this app was just... not it.",False,Hoping for something that could actually help,2,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
