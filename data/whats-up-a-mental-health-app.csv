Love it but needs an update!!,False,"I love this app. I Check it every now and then when I have anxiety, but it would be a lot better if there was an update to make it a little bit more modern because it looks like an app I would‚Äôve had 10 years ago on iPhone 4 but other than that I love it and I highly recommend it!",4,2020-05-19 18:28:56,valeskawerschitz,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
It‚Äôs a REAL tool not a list of inspirational quotes,False,"I am giving a explanation because I think I‚Äôm not the only one that avoids mental health apps and want to reassure them that this app is nothing like any of the other apps. Also as a genuine thank you to the developer üôè

Nothing is worse than thinking something can help you just to find out it is filled with ‚Äúlive love laugh‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre special‚Äù, ‚Äúomg mercury in retrograde‚Äù. That‚Äôs all nice but it is shallow and unhelpful. Some apps with breathing exercises and cutesy quotes really make me feel invalidated and that feeling better is just as easy as namaste. That if you just say the word ‚Äúpositive‚Äù over and over nothing bad will ever happen. So when I found this app I was sooooo happy. I share it with anyone overwhelmed by their mental state and especially when they had little resources available.

I have severe anxiety attacks from PTSD and this app has saved my life. It is clear the developer is a professional and is focused on helping people get grounded and understand their emotions on a deeper level. Sometimes there is just no level of advice that takes the intensity of an emotion away. Sometimes you are just going to feel but this helped me through that in one piece and educated me on how to identify what I need.",5,2020-11-02 04:09:14,JmeAl3na,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
Cons of the Forums,False,"Provides easy and immediate access to coping strategies and techniques that users can rely when experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Users are give information to understand their feelings and emotions, as well as ways they can break the cycle of feeling this way. However, forums should be better controlled. Anyone can post anything, which can be hurtful to users, especially teens. Although it is said that the app is for anyone that is 4 years old and older, children that do not know how to read will not be able to use it. Individuals that are visually impaired will not be able to use it either.

An interesting point that was made by Steinberg (2014) is that the pain that adolescence experience when they are social rejected ‚Äúclosely resembles physical pain in neurological terms that taking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, actually can help alleviate it‚Äù (95). Being socially rejected is a painful experience for teens that can definitely make things worse for those that are already struggling. Based on the review criteria above and my own experience with What‚Äôs Up, I would rate this app a 3 out 5. What‚Äôs Up has many different coping strategies and techniques that users can access whenever they are in need of it. However, individuals can post whatever they want on the forums that can potentially harm users.",3,2021-02-02 03:23:55,LovinDePuppies <3 <3 <3 :D,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
Needs attention but has potential,False,"The most dynamic component of this app is its active forum receiving posts from users every couple of minutes. As Murphy writes in her article on teens usage of social network sites (SNS), ‚ÄúSNSs can be used to help adolescents form an identity‚Ä¶When used correctly and monitored well by parents or adults, adolescents can effectively use SNSs to explore themselves and construct identity (Murphy, 2013, pg. 4). This particular forum site may not be the safest kind of SNS available for adolescents. The purpose of this forum is for users to chat with others experiencing struggles similar to them, and there are various categories a post can fall under like seeking advice, rant, asking for help and other but there no safeguards, like app moderators, in place currently to protect vulnerable population, like teens, from experiencing the negative side of anonymous posting. This can result in further damage being done to an adolescent‚Äôs identity formation and the learning inappropriate coping skills to dealing with their emotions.

Very useful! Thank you,False,"I've trued so many apps that help you check in with yourself and calm down, or become more aware of your surroundings instead of your feelings and etc. None of them have ever really helped despite me wishing they could. They have too many features and I'll get confused and even more frustrated. This app is so simple and rounded that I was able to navigate it while starting to go into a panic and then found the right tools to help me calm down. It reminded me to breathe and think of this moment and I'm so grateful, these times have been hard. Thank you so much to the developer(s); I am happy to have donated to such a genuine app. :^)

Edit to my review: I still like to use this app for the tools it has, but I don't use it nearly as much. The forums are also pretty bad and could make someone feel worse than they already do since there's so much drama and uncensored content on there. I can tell most of the people on there are teens or kids, which isn't the developer's fault, but it does have a negative effect on the app overall.",3,2020-10-06 02:56:51,mothwish,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
üëèüëèüëè,False,"I‚Äôm very impressed!  This app is everything that‚Äôs right, honestly.  I was so skeptical.  I have several diagnosis including C-PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injury, Panic Disorder, bipolar 1, agoraphobia, dissociation, etc.  If I have a bad enough panic attack, I lose nights of sleep, which triggers my bipolar mania.  I can have panic attacks because I‚Äôm afraid of having a panic attack.  I work hard for my stability and if I think I‚Äôm losing it I fall apart.  

My point is, this app helps me tremendously when I‚Äôm triggered.  It grounds me in ways I‚Äôve heard of in therapy but haven‚Äôt been able to utilize during episodes.  Now that these proven methods are all in one app, I can use them without much effort.  

Yesterday I called a crisis line.  When that didn‚Äôt work I figured I‚Äôd look for anything else to help.  It‚Äôs the weekend and it‚Äôs New Years, my counselor isn‚Äôt available.  This app is always there; when it‚Äôs late, the weekend, anytime.

If you struggle at all with any aspect of your mental health, I highly recommend this app.  Especially if you have panic attacks or things like ptsd or agoraphobia.  It could save you hours or days of recovery time.  

To the creator(s) of this app.  From the bottom of my black-and-blue heart, thank you üôè

UPDATE:  I do not recommend the forums they are toxic.  Everything else 10/10",5,2020-01-01 03:50:47,libbidy2010,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
Best app for anxiety ever,False,I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and this is the best app to help me calm down. It has actionable methods that it walks you through as you do them. It had great positive quotes but that‚Äôs not all the app is unlike many other anxiety apps. My favorite section is the grounding techniques that lead you through the five senses. It helps me calm down so much. Thanks so much to the creators of this app.,5,2021-06-28 00:46:53,Kuku Cachoo,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160

So far so good,False,"I downloaded this app on a recommendation, an then didn‚Äôt open it for five days.

A hidden gem - lots of good resources and helpful advice for depression and anxiety,False,It may not be the flashiest app but there are a lot of great resources in here.

Hoping for something that could actually help,False,"I was looking for a CBT app that could help me understand and cope with my intrusive BDD thoughts. Instead, I got an app full of basic platitudes and an option to journal (wow so revolutionary). The fonts are ugly, the layout is not user friendly, and the options for help are extremely limited. Go with something like Youper if you‚Äôre looking for habit/mood tracking, because this app was just... not it.",2,2021-01-21 19:30:01,psylawn,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160

Highly Reccommend!,False,"I‚Äôve only just started using this app, but I am already in love with this app all around! I have personally have had experiences with anxiety and depression episodes and this app has given me an outlet. This is an informative, simple to use app that can also give quick help especially with anxiety! It walks you through a series of actions and activities to bring you back and grounded to reality. It gives you all the right tools you‚Äôll need to be aware of your emotions and surroundings. This app also gives soooo many great coping strategies that help you with the thoughts and feelings you are going through, I have already used a few and it‚Äôs helped tremendously!! Some of the coping strategies that are used in this app is called: Thinking patterns, metaphors, manage worries, and positive steps. Thinking patterns: it helps identify the unhealthy thinking patterns, challenge and distance yourself from them, and see the situation in a different way. Metaphors: this uses a story or illustration to see alternative ways of looking at something and helping you make decision in a more effective way in life. Manage worries: this is where it gives 10 different approaches to try like ‚Äúsetting aside worry time‚Äù to ‚Äúreplaying the worry till your tired‚Äù as well as a few other examples. Positive steps: this gives you multiple options to take a step in the right direction of feeling better like ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù to ‚Äúlearning a new skill/hobby‚Äù to ‚Äúsimply relax‚Äù. This relates to Abnormal Psych and anxiety by how it affects the 3 components: cognitive, physical, and behavioral. This app helps these components on multiple levels for a person and it gives the person a way to quickly help through a panic attack. This app even has a way where you can document all your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, negative habits; this gives a way for a person to to keep a tab on their self and how much they may have changed physically, mentally, or emotionally.",5,2020-11-04 01:16:44,SamGCMU,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,968251160
