Game Changer,"I am a 24 year old nurse with mental health issues and I have a couple of bad habits I‚Äôve been trying to eradicate for months. I‚Äôve tried dozens of apps from habit streaks to accountability apps to online counseling. I installed this app with the intent to explore it and nothing else. But this app is so cleverly designed, it is hard not to love. There are attractive features in this app that will help you build positive habits. Yet, I believe the real hook is the story about you that develops, which happens when you successfully complete your goals. This app does an excellent job of not just making you think, but making you do, which is what I think is the epitome of mental health. It doesn‚Äôt just strive to improve your mental health, it strives to improve your overall function. The app engages you in multiple ways, which sets it apart from the traditional templates of regular one-on-one convos with people who only roundabout with Pinterest-like ‚Äúinspirational sayings.‚Äù I‚Äôm genuinely more motivated, more functional, and have made more changes in my life the past two weeks since I‚Äôve downloaded this app than I have in the last three years. Fabulous mysteriously makes it fun to remind you to be yourself and be healthy and happy at the same time, and keeping those streaks up can be pretty satisfying too. However you use this app, whether it‚Äôs for a day or for a year - strive to commit to it, and you will reach your happiness.",5,2021-03-26 05:17:55,Elijah.Luis,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Inspirational,"I truly do love this app. I have been using it for about a week now, and it has been more helpful than any other app I have tried. I am a young mother to two young boys, I work full time, and go to school full time. I have struggled for years now to learn how to take better care of myself due to my priorities are always making sure my children are taken care of while my health and wellness, both mentally and physically, took the back seat. For the first time in my life, I am actually creating healthy routines for myself. In the morning, I meditate, drink a glass of water, take my vitamins, and stretch. In the evenings I tidy up, read for 30 minutes and write down what went well today. And I‚Äôm still only using the free version! I think that is the best thing of all. Due to a strict budget, I cannot afford the premium version of Fabulous at the moment. However, I can still access a lot of the features that are essential to me bettering myself through this process. This also allows me to make sure that this app is everything I need it to be before I make the hefty $50 yearly subscription (I know $50 is not a lot by any means, I just can‚Äôt afford that right nowü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and that‚Äôs okay! Because I can still thankfully do everything I need to do starting out. I sincerely appreciate the developers of this app, and I hope to stay with Fabulous for many years to come!‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2020-06-11 03:21:05,Izehbelle,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
This app is worth it,"I had previously come across this app in the past, downloaded it to see what the hype was and instantly deleted. Recently I came across this user who had recommended using fabulous to get back on track, and creating good, healthy habits. I‚Äôve always been a routined person, but would fall off and struggle to keep track or stay on track. I would beat myself up and feel disappointed that I had to start over. After taking some needed time off for myself (especially during the pandemic) I am and have been working on myself to heal by getting back into creating healthy and happy routine for a better life. 

Just recently downloading this app (again) I wanted to put this to the test. Only after about a week of using this app, I will say that this app is by far one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs so gentle but so rewarding and honest about life and being ‚ÄúO.K.‚Äù With falling off track, making mistakes, counting the small wins, feeing appreciative, but the biggest one is making me believe in myself more by becoming the best version of myself. Mental health is so important and this app makes you feel like the darks do happen, but you can always come out on top. 

So if I had to say what is an app that works and I‚Äôm willing to spend the money...well, you‚Äôve come to the right place.",5,2021-04-13 17:03:02,Mommakelz17,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Skeptically positive,I actually got this app a couple months ago when I needed so positive affirmations or medications to just kind of get through the day... as I started slinking a little further into a pretty dark depression I didn‚Äôt use it I actually deleted it for a bit and frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt get into to app. I thought this little story‚Äôs were annoying... then a few weeks back I had gotten so bad I wasn‚Äôt eating or taking care of my self at all I started searching for routine apps to just try and get myself taking care of myself to feel better... As I was searching I saw this app pop up and I remembered it did have routines as well. I re downloaded it and I can actually say for the last few weeks of using it. I‚Äôm starting to like the story‚Äôs and the guidance because I WAS READY... had I reviewed this app a couple months ago it wouldn‚Äôt have been positive because that‚Äôs not where I was... but I can now say thank you! Because this app is really helping me build better habits and stay on task and I check back on it often and now listen to the story‚Äôs because I know it‚Äôs going to get me to that next level of taking care of myself. As a Mom/Wife/ and in Management... Who has time for that? Right.

Awesome App!!!!,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this app.  I‚Äôve been in therapy for years for some losses etc. I‚Äôve currently been enrolled in a DBT course,8 weeks to get through 4modules.  You can‚Äôt reach knowledge or gain enough practice to be great at this in one course.  This app you have here is the perfect in between classes to work with as extra coping mechanisms..  it brings in soooo much helpful information for personal care and development.  It‚Äôs very easy to use.  For me, it is not overwhelming, you can do as much or as little as you want during the 3 parts of your days.  It has given me more practice in becoming one mindful where everybody should learn.  This mindfulness can be done in 5 minutes or less or longer.  It‚Äôs giving your mind a break.  Instead of racing around thoughts, you learn to focus and remain calm.  The meditations here are very easy to sit back and listen.  I‚Äôve even been so relaxed I fell asleep which is very hard for me to do.  It has done wonders in just these few days to work with your app.  I love the challenges!  I also like the way you can choose what you want for your daily routine.  If what you offer isn‚Äôt enough you provide a way for us to add our own routines in, if it‚Äôs not working on the list.  Thank you so much for offering this FABULOUS app.",5,2020-01-25 12:56:35,Dcjidvnjdcnm,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Glitching out,"If this app was working right, it would be a five star app. But it is not and has not been for about two weeks. It‚Äôs been glitching, not allowing me to access today‚Äôs list of goals and routines to check off. My daily coaching option that‚Äôs on my routines no longer brings anything up to play for the day and instead just has a list of activities you could bring up. I bought the lifetime subscription and I‚Äôm kicking myself for it now that nothing is working on it. I‚Äôve been using this app on and off for five years among varying devices without glitching issues and now all the sudden now that I‚Äôm on day 34 or so on my current journey, it‚Äôs just decided it no longer needs to work. 
Another annoying thing is that if you forget to mark the things off as you‚Äôre doing them and decide to mark it off later, it doesn‚Äôt seem to count it the same as though you didn‚Äôt actually do anything but are just checking it off. I find this incredibly annoying. Not everyone has time to stare at their phone after every activity on their list and check it off. I‚Äôm a busy person. Some of us want to check it off later, that doesn‚Äôt mean we didn‚Äôt do it when we are supposed to. Good lord.
Also, I‚Äôve had to uninstall and reinstall this app several times just to get it to work. I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that. There‚Äôs plenty of space on my phone and everything else works fine.

"2/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è for this absolutely fabulous rip-off, data-collecting machine","Stay away, unless you're comfortable with paying to be exploited for the sole benefit of a privatized university's already generously funded science lab, and feel good about being fabulously manipulated by how pretty this parasitic pig wearing lipstick. 

2/5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è is frankly generous for this unFABULOUS disappointment! This app over-promises and under-delivers, while exploiting as many individuals as possible by tricking you into forfeiting your privacy, for the lab's own benefit. What's intentionally excluded in the description, yet IMPT AF to know about this fabulously manipulative, money-making machine is that it is a parasitic, date-collection trap, where the User (you) are tricked into becoming another lab rat.

My Saving Grace,"One of my biggest issues is feeling lost even tho my business gives me a sense of purpose I‚Äôm all alone in the basement and have no schedule. I always thought my life would be different. Now I know it‚Äôs up to me to execute the life I one day will have but not to worry about it or dwell on my past but literally just live day to day improving myself and loving myself and laughing and being grateful and giving each step of the way. That‚Äôs how you live. Fabulous is helping me get some structure because I sort of just get lost sometimes not knowing when or how to accomplish things. Like do I really have to go to bank everyday? Lol no the adderal was doing much more harm than I thought and cutting out the toxic ppl feels so good. My phone can be a curse but it‚Äôs been directing and guiding me lately, I‚Äôm so out of touch w the world cuz I‚Äôve kept myself so isolated all these years. Like Kanye, Taylor Swift they ha d issues to snd I‚Äôm not the only one lol I can‚Äôt believe I thought I was a bar person. I‚Äôm such a good person and I‚Äôm just feeling really happy anc hopeful . And it‚Äôs only day two . ‚ù§Ô∏èmy friends Richard was my saving grace and I‚Äôll always love him for that even tho I‚Äôm changing for me. So I can be the boss I was meant to be lol

Life Saver,"I‚Äôve never been the type of person to steer towards the ‚Äúself-help‚Äù or ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù section. In the last year, however, I began a journey of self discovery. It wasn‚Äôt on purpose. It just sort of happened. The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. Some things need to change entirely. Some things I didn‚Äôt even realize that I was doing. This app is so well researched and written. The content is amazing. Especially for someone like me who is usually a total skeptic. I decided to give it a shot, and I am actually seeing results. I have always been a cynic, pessimist, and grew more and more neurotic as I got older. That pattern kept growing until I would have bouts of depression that I literally could not get out of. Spirals of self destruction, and I couldn‚Äôt stop the thoughts. Well, let me tell you - the thoughts will creep up. But I check myself. It‚Äôs starting to come more naturally now. My brain is like ‚Äúhey, where do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù, and it stops all that negative stuff in it‚Äôs tracks. I‚Äôve never been able to do that before. It‚Äôs absolutely stunning.

The Jump Start I NEEDED,"I used to live my ~dream~ life and I had my set of habits that worked. I was always in a great space and nothing could have brought me down. Then I moved away for college. The freshman 15 happened and I just went up from there, I started sleeping later and waking up later, and I lost focus of the habits that made me happy. Since then I‚Äôve been trying to get the motivation or the will to do the things I love and I always feel the need to start it all at once which is difficult and unrealistic. Bit this app has made that more of a reality. I might get a later start to my day since I‚Äôm still just trying but the practices and talks on this app, the realization that motivation isn‚Äôt real you just have to do, and the checklist all give me the push necessary to bettering me and my daily life. Honestly, can‚Äôt really find the words to describe it but try the free trial and see if it works for you. Personally, I used it once and didn‚Äôt really understand it, forgot to cancel my trial and here we are. Best accident to happen yet.

***RIPOFF***SCAM***THIEVES,"Tried this app last year and didn‚Äôt find it all that motivating. No worries‚Ä¶everyone has their preferences. Forgot to cancel before my free 30 day trial was up. No worries‚Ä¶that‚Äôs on me. But I made sure to go in and cancel right away so I wouldn‚Äôt make the same mistake again. Imagine my surprise when I started getting ‚Äòpayment failed‚Äô emails after the one year anniversary of the expiration of my free trial. Like, enough emails to be considered harassment. So finally, I responded to one of them and reminded them that they did not have an active credit card on file because I was no longer an active account holder. I received an automatic response saying how much they value me as a customer and they‚Äôll try to get back to me as soon as they can, but they‚Äôre super busy. No worries - they can never get back to me as far as I‚Äôm concerned - the whole point of my email was that I was trying to get them to STOP contacting me. SOOO‚Ä¶imagine my surprise when I checked my credit card statement today and found that a week after my email that they were too busy to respond to, they MIRACULOUSLY found my credit card information and charged my account for another year!!! NOT fabulous. SNEAKY and UNETHICAL!! Oh, and if you‚Äôre wondering if they ever responded to my email‚Ä¶they did not. Too busy looking for my unauthorized credit card information, I imagine.

"Beautiful UI, bad UX","So the path of slow and steady incremental changes makes a ton of sense. The kinds of tasks it seems like the app orients on, also seem well founded and useful. However, the way you interact with the app itself to achieve those ends is so confusing and unintuitive to me. There‚Äôs no one place to look at what I‚Äôve achieved or how I‚Äôm doing, or which goals I might choose. Even after using it for a few days, I‚Äôm still unsure of where to find any succinct information or even which buttons I should be pressing. In addition, the way it offers me the option to make goals and follow up with those goals just doesn‚Äôt match the natural way I make decisions or the flow of my day. 
For example, I‚Äôd see the notification to drink water with bleary eyes immediately after waking up, but before my brain can comprehend. Then it disappears into the fog of slowly waking. This morning, I finally did get myself to immediately open the app and log that I drank water, then it promptly opened a loud animated cut scene which was pretty annoying for me, but even more annoying for the person asleep next to me. I hastily closed the whole thing. 
I‚Äôd really like to utilize the set of slow and consistent reminders that seem to be at the heart of this app, but what does it matter if I can‚Äôt actually figure out how to use it? Frankly, every time I open this app I eventually just angrily close it, and am left feeling frustrated.

App quality has gone down,"I‚Äôve been a member for over a year. Over the past 6 months the app has repeatedly frozen up, routines open without the habits loading with them, the habits being checked off on the watch but not reflecting in the mobile app, and the app completely crashing. I really like the content but the app is starting to heavily detract from the experience. At some point the pain of switching is less than the pain of staying. I‚Äôm a Dev so I get that this kind of app isn‚Äôt easy to build, but the foundations have to be solid.

You guys desperately need a feature freeze so the entire dev and design team can focus on fixing what is already there. Cleaning up the design, removing buttons that don‚Äôt need to be there, removing concepts that make no sense etc. (I have yet to understand the differences between sphere, premium, journeys and challenges). Simple things are painful, like how do I leave/end a challenge, how to I delete a routine? You mean we need to start another challenge just to end the current one? Why am I even given the option to join a challenge when the first journey isn‚Äôt done?

For all the talk about fabulous being like an instrument, and the need to learn new words to use it, fabulous is pretty bad at teaching those new concepts. Throwing up another letter isn‚Äôt a solution. UI elements need to be removed, concepts need to be simplified.",2,2020-07-07 17:25:00,Fralcon,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Great app,"During the 7 day trial I found myself making better habits to help myself out during the day especially my morning routine. I work a night shift and have to balance out my day accordingly but this app really helped me with that with the alerts for something that used to escapes my mind early in the morning, which is to drink water it became a great habit I developed even when I‚Äôm off of work I still wake up and drink water which keeps me on the same schedule. With all the options for: the morning, afternoon, and evening routines, it‚Äôs getting a little used to but none the less I‚Äôm gaining better habits to help me throughout my day. I can say I appreciate this app and look forward to gaining my life back with healthier decisions. The only bad thing I can say about the app is when you mark that you did an activity that you did not complete, the app won‚Äôt allow you to undo that you completed it, so for someone like me who is openly honest about what I do, it will get a little frustrating to know you didn‚Äôt complete that goal for that day but everything else on this app is great and to me life saving.

Terrible company and customer service.,"This company is in the business of stealing people‚Äôs money. Not only is their app ridiculously expensive, they don‚Äôt offer refunds for accidental auto renewal, or if you did not like the app. EVERY other company I have ever had experience with will offer refunds if you are not happy with their service, if it did not meet your expectations, and especially if you were accidentally paying for an app for an entire year beyond when you ever even opened the app. It is clear to me that they cannot afford to be in this business if they are going to rob their customers of their money when they aren‚Äôt happy with the service. Again, I have experience with many many apps and services and everytime I have asked for a refund I get it, no. questions. asked.  The fact that this company has the audacity to tell me they are keeping my money when I don‚Äôt even have the app still downloaded on my phone is mind blowing to me. Get out of this business, you aren‚Äôt helping people, you are robbing me.  My auto renewal was on Dec 30th and I emailed them days later. they are keeping my money for the entire 2020 year. I could understand if they maybe kept one month but refunded me the rest but to keep this ENTIRE year of my money when I‚Äôve been very clear with them I am not using this app is just ridiculous.

Brought me back to myself.. and then some,"After going through a very dark period, and as someone who has struggled with depression my entire life, I can honestly say Fabulous helped bring me back to life, back to myself. I have spent decades learning self care and reparenting myself, but in the very dark times, it can still be challenging to come out the other end. In this particular instance, I truly needed my hand held and guidance back to my light. Fabulous gave me this gift and so much more. When in a state of depression, something as simple as remembering to drink water or eat a good breakfast or move my body can feel like a mountain to climb. Fabulous‚Äô gentle daily reminders, along with lovely inspiring encouragement, made all of these small goals attainable again. If you‚Äôve struggled with depression, you know the impact such small feats can have. I have been using the app for over a month now and after completing the first journey am feeling so much more energized and vibrant - I feel like my true self again.

Overall a great app,"I have recommended this app to multiple people as it has been a great way for me to track my progress and receive consistent accountability. I love how customizable the routines are, and while there is guidance from the app, you‚Äôre ultimately in control of your experience. As far as feedback goes, I‚Äôve grown to strongly dislike the background music. I understand the healing and relaxation properties that music can have, but I find these specific tunes very annoying compared to meditative sounds I prefer. I have muted the sounds during the routines and also went to settings to turn them off. Unfortunately it comes back on no matter what I do. I also believe that celebrating overall progress would be nice. In addition to longest streaks, acknowledging consistent attempts will encourage people even more I believe. For instance, I have never completed an entire week of my routines, but there was one week I tried everyday, and there were only two days I couldn‚Äôt fully complete. I like to celebrate small wins, and that to me was one. Other than that I love what the Fabulous team is doing with the app. All I ask is that you either offer different selections of background music and/or allow a muting option that actually works please.",4,2021-04-28 16:38:18,Netta Lynne,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
A path to a better me,"This is actually my second time attempting my ""journey"". I started once last year, but due to a lot of mental and environmental issues, I had to delete the app just to relieve some of my stress. Recently, though, I've wanted to improve myself and my life, and have been working on my own to pick up a few new projects to focus on (learning a new language, learning an instrument, etc.). I remembered how great Fabulous was at helping me keep up a solid routine, and so decided to download it again. Now that I'm past the ""drink water"" challenge once again, I'm really happy to spend a little on a subscription so I can fill up my ""rituals"" with all the things I wanna do!
The only reason I can't give it five stars is because I feel there are many places it could improve, such as the ability to add custom ""habits"", and the option to skip the ""drink water"" and ""eat breakfast"" challenges if you've already been doing that for however long (like me, hehe).
I also find it a little bit of an oxymoron that the app continuously tells you to get away from tech, yet says to make sure you use it as often as you possibly can, as well as follow all of their social, but I suppose that's just a part of running an app, haha.",4,2020-07-27 20:01:19,Kae Sera,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Just let the app guide you.,"This app has brought me out of the COVID-19 quarantine feeling of helplessness and confusion. I am so happy that I did the trial and didn‚Äôt let my tendency to control things take over. My advice on how to do the trial: just let the app guide you. Content is slowly dripped to you. You don‚Äôt know what is next. Just accept that and trust your new coach, which is an app full of a ton of science-based content. The first thing you are told to do is start a morning routine of drinking a glass of water when you first wake up. If you already do this, then just check it off and be patient. If you must, start one of the challenges so you have something new to do, but try to start small. For the first few days of the trial I felt like the app was asking me to just totally trust it, even though it hadn‚Äôt given me a good enough reason. I also felt that 7 days was not long enough. But by day 5 I was feeling really good. I had set an alert on my phone to cancel if I didn‚Äôt want to start a paid subscription, but I decided that this is worth it.

Great app to create and inspire new healthy habits!,"I stumbled across this app and thought I‚Äôd give it a shot. One of the things I suffer from is lack of accountability, I‚Äôll procrastinate and avoid things of I can, choosing to lay around and be lazy if no one is telling me otherwise. This app reminds me throughout the day to practice new healthy habits that I chose to create a happier and more active me! The support from the positive community here and the inspiring little messages that come with goal completion give you that extra push to continue on the path you set up. I‚Äôve only been doing it for a week and albeit a slow start, I am beginning to really see some new habits form and I love it! Be the healthier, happier you that you know you can and want to be. It‚Äôs as simple as saying ‚ÄúI want to change‚Äù and you don‚Äôt have to do it alone. Having served 10 years in the military I recognize the importance of support in trying to develop yourself into your goals.

You get what you put in,"This app is a great tool to help disorganized individuals get organized. Personally, I often find myself forgetting to do simple things because I am too caught up in thought. This app snaps me out of that so that I can remember other things I need to do. Furthermore, it has an incredible amount of great advice regarding a variety of subjects. This advice will make you both more efficient and effective in whatever you are setting out to accomplish. I greatly respect the way this app was designed.

Having said that, this app won‚Äôt cure you of laziness. You need to find a way to be intrinsically motivated to maintain habits. When you have cultivated that motivation, this app will serve as a way to hone that motivation. I don‚Äôt use it for work, as that is not something I need to be reminded of. However, I often forget to tidy up or make my bed. Even more, I forget to celebrate every little victory I have throughout the day, and to end the day with gratitude. These small tweaks in habit lead to enormous changes in wellbeing. 

For anyone who needs help (or even advice) with keeping their life organized, healthy, and productive, I highly recommend this app.",5,2020-03-28 02:35:15,Diogenes the Optimist,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
"Disappointed, easy fix","This app seemed promising but turned out to be really unfortunate. I started with the 7 day free trial and after setting my intentions, I was given my first new habit. To drink water every morning. This is something I already do every day so I was eager to just move on to my next step. Unfortunately the app makes you complete the habit you‚Äôre on for 3 DAYS before giving you another. And you cannot preview what the next habit will be. So I stopped opening the app because it had nothing to tell me. I then realized that if the next habit was also something I already do, I would be forced out of the trial period and charged the yearly fee before I even got my third habit. I quickly cancelled the subscription.

This issue would be sooo easily fixed if when given a ‚Äúhabit‚Äù to begin you had the option to say ‚ÄúI already do this‚Äù so it could move on to something else. I searched everywhere in the app for an option to skip the task but if it exists I couldn‚Äôt find it. Developers, please add a skip option and this app would be so much more worthwhile. It‚Äôs almost like the app assumes you must not have any good habits when you begin. Either that or they are hoping customers will accidentally slip by that 7 day mark trying to make progress without realizing they‚Äôve been charged $40.",2,2020-02-09 03:05:58,kdubzzs,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,"{'id': 14172968, 'body': 'Hi\xa0there, thank you for sharing your feedback with us!

Great Habit App - But does not have a way to pause if you end up in hospital,"This is a very great app; but learns towards ableism because it doesn‚Äôt allow actual life to occur. I ended up in the hospital for a freak accident of internal bleeding, had emergency surgery, and was bedfast. I had an entire schedule that I had spent months working towards in this app before the surgery. This app has no way to press pause. Instead it sends messages implying that everyone ‚Äúfalls of the bandwagon‚Äù - umm, that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here: thank you. It comes across as condescending and becomes a reminder of what you can‚Äôt do and all of the life you are missing out on because you are trying to recover. It‚Äôs completely demoralizing. This app absolutely needs a way to hit pause and take a step back when life (car wrecks, deaths, etc.) gets in the way of the less important ‚Äòfive minute walks, workout ritual, make sure you‚Äôre tidying your space, yoga rituals, and the like. Nobody cares about that crap when you‚Äôre in bed fighting for your life. The creators of the app did not think that through - life happens. Pauses are healthy too; the alternative is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder rooted in Ableism. This app needs a pause button.

Good but frustrating,"I have a lot of personal goals that just seemed impossible, this app was great for me a person with add who rd DS to push up hill than and force things rather than stop and do the things that lead to self care and happiness. For me it‚Äôs recipe to self love. Make sure you read at least one page, meditate for a few minutes. I like the animations and the calming music that helps me to slow down and be in the moment. But sometimes I fall off the wagon and though the intentions are good, im forced to fill out a form that takes too long and ultimately discourages me from getting back into my routine. Sometimes the Home Screen is so cluttered with junk I‚Äôll never read. I
Or I ignore. Perhaps the ui hasn‚Äôt quite been mastered to make me care of the flow needs adjusted? I need a way out sometimes.  I also suggested to my partner to give it a shot, I really sold it to him because he‚Äôs doing self care work. The initial onboarding sent him into an eye roll and I‚Äôm certain he will never open it again. Which is sad because I feel like he could e joy it. I‚Äôm a designer and I get wanting to be the be all comprehensive app. But it feels like it‚Äôs gotten a little unwieldy.

"Good concept, confusing UI","This app totally works ‚Äî building habits a little at a time is precisely what my last therapist told me works very well for my ADD and anxiety. Doing one thing for a few days, then adding another little thing, and so on, had been working great for me for a little over a week now. 
I‚Äôve seen people say that the app is inflexible in its goals, but most of the time you can work around the specifics and do something else in the same vein. I can‚Äôt drink a full glass of water first in the morning because of my acid reflux, but I can remember that it‚Äôs a goal of mine and drink 4-5 extra sips. I don‚Äôt exercise first thing in the morning, but instead I did 8 mins of yoga. 
This is great therapy for those of us who can‚Äôt get access to behavioral therapy right now. I feel more refreshed when I go about my business in the morning because I have more habits to keep me moving. I feel rewarded just for drinking water. In principle, this app is amazing. 
The only issue is that there are so many buttons and screens that it gets wildly confusing sometimes as to what I‚Äôm trying to do and how I got here. I end up just force closing sometimes and starting over.",4,2021-04-12 13:18:06,MRStone27,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Amazing app (highly recommend),"This app is absolutely amazing. It may have a confusing set up at first but it really helps you once you‚Äôve figured out how it works.

This app also has ‚Äúcircles‚Äù designated to certain things that you may be struggling with. It allows you to chat with others from all around the world and share your experiences and help each other. I think this feature is really great because you get to see others progress in their life and you also get to help them with it, and share your progress. There are also journeys that you set up to help you with everyday problems. For example, social media detox, self-love, de-clutter, gratitude, being able to let go, journaling, etc. This app gives you a chance to reflect and change yourself for the better.

App is nice,"I really like the visuals like seeing the calendar at a month glance and seeing the progress that I‚Äôve made.

So I have been on track my calendar doesn‚Äôt show it and that makes me sad and I also know that I need to cancel my membership for this application going forward it‚Äôs two limiting and it‚Äôs not helpful when I feel defeated.

Not intuitive,"I tried to set up this app for the free trial (7 days) but it made me start with only one habit that happened to already be something I do every day. And then because I don‚Äôt always look at my phone every morning and didn‚Äôt check off a day even when I did it, it set me back to day 1. So the one week trial was useless to see if I could build new habits. When I cancelled before getting charged, they sent me an email offering me a 30 day trial since 7 days might not be enough‚Äîthis seemed like a great option until I tried to use it and because I already had an account it said ‚Äúyou‚Äôve already subscribed‚Äù. So they sent me a useless 30 day trial unless I want to create a second account and start over from day 1, again. 

Besides those issues, i found the animations to be rather annoying and pointless. Maybe it works better over the long term, but it really feels oriented towards teens and young adults and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. The interface is also not intuitive and you have to go through like 5 steps to check off each habit, which feels like it wastes a bunch of my time when I could be actually getting on with my day.

I love that it gets me in the flow, but I‚Äôm pursuing minimalism in my digital life for some brain space and this app just WILL NOT HAVE IT. It won‚Äôt give you the option of turning off alarms for your routines (I dislike notifications on my phone for things I already remembered... you become numb to what all of them are telling you) without keeping a huge banner in your way asking you to set an alarm for your routine. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to turn off the feature where other users ‚Äúask you questions‚Äù... (why does another human care about my random, unscientific opinion on whether coffee is healthy?) and pass around infographics. The ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù feature pops up in your daily list whether you‚Äôd like it to or not. If you try to turn off notifications it will keep pushing you to turn them back on.

And boy am I glad I did and kept the app! I know the price can seem a bit steep at first (40$ per year or 250$ for a lifetime membership BUT when you break it down that comes out to about 3$ a month for their annual membership which isn‚Äôt all too bad), but if you take this app seriously and work hard at what it tells you to do, it actually helps at changing your daily habits and it makes it fun and exciting! There are letters you get when you start a new journey and coaching you get daily. I love the live challenges because you get to do it with the community and see people‚Äôs progress in the feed.

I was shortly notified via email that I had to request a refund through a link they sent me. There were many options and I picked the one that said I forgot to cancel my free trial and I was notified that because Apple tells me when the free trial will end and the subscription will renew when signing up for the free trial, they do not refund for that. It was truly an honest mistake. Anyways, just to check, I attempted to see if a refund was able to be received for any of the reasons listed and they do not reimburse for their subscriptions no matter the case.

There are also SO many options for activities you can add to each of your three routines too, which is awesome.

A journey to ‚Äúeat fish and seafood or flax seeds three times in a week‚Äù allergic to fish, can‚Äôt do that‚Äù, tells me to go to sleep and follow their schedule umm I work nights. there should 100% be an option to skip these journeys or convert them/ customize them/ change the time they‚Äôre to be accomplished, or something I don‚Äôt know but the user experience I do have in this area occasionally frustrates me.",3,2021-03-30 13:45:34,Gogurtgirl,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

This may not sound like a lot but just two weeks ago I was setting four alarms every night and snoozing them repeatedly in the morning, rolling out of bed and into the shower and trudging to work without having ingested anything but coffee. I particularly love that Fabulous discourages you from trying to take on too much at once or make too many changes; instead, the focus is on building one habit at a time and celebrating small victories.

I found this app to be so incredibly empowering. I felt heard about things that many doctors and professionals had left me feeling uninspired and alone about. I saw that my struggles were not unique to me but also finally gathered the strength to make positive changes in my life. I never use paid apps but hope to soon expand to a premium membership because I can‚Äôt imagine my life without this app and want to see how much more I can grow.

Too many things going on,"I wanted to like this app there are some areas where the UI is great, but there were too many things going on at once. My first three days had an easy goal to drink water every morning. I already do that so I thought, ‚Äúok, easy start, great.‚Äù But I opened the app and I gave me an immersive experience to relive my dream then when I closed that another immersive experience to drink water, but the transition wasn‚Äôt informative. Then a woman started talking and music began playing. I‚Äôm at home, but if I had been at work that would have been super awkward. Then I finally got back to the main screen and it had ticked off that I drank water on day 1. I wish I could have ticked the box because that is satisfaction we all enjoy. Instead I just felt confused and frustrated. The app idea is nice and the browse area has awesome info graphics for goals, but the experience to accomplish those is cumbersome. I only used this for a day so I did not give it very long, but I also didn‚Äôt want to after the first experience.

Life changing! ‚ù§Ô∏è,"I am a 38 year old married working mom mother of   2 teen girls ages 17 senior and 11 6th grader who have been distance learning since April while both my husband and I were furloughed for several months but now work from home most of the time when we don‚Äôt randomly have to go in and then have to pray plan b or c for coverage at home when we both have to go in..so basically my stress levels are those of  an average person today.  üòä With all the ‚Äúnew normals‚Äù, habits went out the window for all in this house so I was determined to turn it around by starting with me.

It employees neuroaccustics, habit forming simplified (to encourage long lasting positive change) enjoyable graphics and soothing voices, and most importantly it includes an accountability journal for each habit; Ensuring you detail your experience and not just ‚Äúcheck it off.‚Äù I started this app to test as a training supplement for my students and I have enjoyed its approach so much I bought a year membership for myself.

Now 5 months later I am starting school again next week and had a sudden burst in energy to download this app and get a good use of my membership and even though its only been about a week I feel so much better about myself and my productivity because the pacing of the app and how it truly embraced that a little bit of progress goes a long way! My personal favorite part is the little infographics in the discover tab, and for the premium version the ability to join live challenges to mix up your routine if you want/need. Everything is truly catered to your personal experience and growth as long as you are honest with yourself!

Fabulous is fabulous,"I‚Äôm a week into using this app and so far I really like it. I love their approach of making big changes using little baby steps and not rushing into too much at once.

There were also a couple times I was trying to explore a new goal and in doing so accidentally checked it off when that‚Äôs not what I was trying to do, so navigation isn‚Äôt 100% intuitive, but I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to call it confusing. 

It seems like as I progress further along I‚Äôll have more say in the habits I focus on too, but the initial ones are good foundations, so I didn‚Äôt mind the lack of choice right off the bat.

"Great, but disingenuous.","The app itself is great, the graphics, the ability to achieve your aspirations and track your progress is sound.

I realized that no app can truly help you attain greatness, you must examine the situation yourself. Why? Because behind the app is a developer, and what does the developer need? Money, payment, dinero, dough, the big bucks. It seems ironic and comical that they are charging you an unreasonable price for something that should be available to every person on the face of this earth regardless of his/her paycheck; improving their lives and finding self induced-happiness. To keep it short I‚Äôm disappointed, but not surprised. I just ask that this app doesn‚Äôt FORCE the user to upgrade by taunting them with his/her future self.

Not like other habit apps,"This is much better designed (and beautiful!!).

It really encourages you to just do one or two things at first and take it slow, versus automatically giving you access to absolutely everything (and therefore setting you up to fail). Plus it‚Äôs got these cute stories, poems that are sort of like super quick mediation, and REALLY good animation. Plus it‚Äôs got a huge number of tips, gentle reminders, and inspirational messages to go along with the habits. So when it started telling me to eat breakfast every day (which you are technically allowed to delete if you‚Äôre super against breakfast I guess), it also started adding a daily tiny article about food, or breakfast ideas, or (my favorite) reminders to actually buy breakfast foods...

I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Fore example, I check off all of my habits for the day before I go to bed. The app takes forever to boot up. It now only allows me to check off the habits in my morning routine before crashing. Sometimes I‚Äôm lucky to even get that far. Even if I do get to check off my habits, I often have to do it again, as it did not save my progress. This leads to another crash.

Great app so far!!,"First off, to all the people complaining about the trials,

You don‚Äôt have to buy the subscription to use the app, there is an exit button at the top of the screen. Then after that the app explains that you need to start small. Then it has you drink water for three days. If you already do that just wait three days, but if your angry that it‚Äôs such a simple thing, read the app. You don‚Äôt need to rush into everything so fast! Taking it slow is nice sometimes.

Ok, now to the review! I downloaded this app about a half hour ago and love it! I like how it uses your name to make it seem more personalized. Apps that do that are really awesome because they grab your attention. I also like how easy it is to set up. I set it up in under a minute. I just had to answer a few questions and I was off! It gives you tips on how to achieve goals.

I also love how it takes it slow while still moving fast. Some apps have no introduction to self care at all and just tell you to set a goal. This app isn‚Äôt like that. It tells you a bit about the app and asks you a few questions, gives you a task and tells you why you should do it. It also doesn‚Äôt say, right you have the app now your on your own! It has a pre-made routine for you to follow!

The app is simple and has a lot of features you typically see as in app purchases elsewhere. You can choose whichever habits you‚Äôd like to start including in your morning/afternoon/evening rituals, there‚Äôs ambient music, timers for tasks or goals, and encouraging little snippets scattered throughout.

So glad I found this app. You will be too!,"New year, time to make some changes. Although this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time I‚Äôve said that before. I‚Äôve tried to get some helpful habits going times before, but just kept losing motivation so quickly.
I‚Äôve tried a few other apps, and honestly, some of those I tried may work for other people. But I can say Fabulous is the only one that works for me.
Part of the reason I would lose motivation before was I thought too big at a time, and I had trouble getting started small without coaching. This app helps with that, by starting very small, and it coaches you along the way. It really is a personal feeling app.
It helps you introduce more and more little goals, building habits in steps and bringing them all together. Before you know it, you‚Äôve already made big changes. The community feeling of it makes it feel quite down to earth, and to me that makes it easier to stay motivated. When you know tons of other people are doing the same thing as you, you all help each other out, and everyone gets to where they want.
It really is amazing what you can do without ever paying anything. I might upgrade some day, but for now I‚Äôm real happy with Fabulous.

Slow to respond ‚Äî lots of steps,The app allows you to pick daily routines but when the daily routine opens it goes into its own process for example the step to drink water every day when you open it it puts on this music and the screen is locked you cannot get out of it it doesn‚Äôt allow you to check off that you drink water until it goes through this 10 or 15 minute process and then if you don‚Äôt stay it reverts back and you have to try and do it again it would not let me click on anything and then as far as other daily routine activities it would not allow you to pick too many which is good but it had it separated in the morning afternoon evening so for example if you wanted to tidy your room or make your bed it wouldn‚Äôt allow you to make that a morning routine the only morning routine would was drink water.  Way too complicated to use really not worth it it should be easier to pick two things you want to do every morning.

Stand by your product, and only make a sale when you know your customer is getting good value.  I don‚Äôt believe for a second, that you are interested in changing peoples lives.

"Small oversights, but it WORKS","Honestly, I find the app a little annoying.

There are some typos and other proofing oversights that are a little irksome. It‚Äôs not the most intuitive app to navigate at first. 
But despite all of my criticisms and reasons to dislike it - IT JUST WORKS. I tried on my own to establish a morning routine for six months.

As someone who works at 4am in an actual shop, it‚Äôs really starting to worry me that I might not be able to keep up with the morning routine because I don‚Äôt want to wake up any earlier than I have to.

Best App for Creating a Schedule!,"I bought the full version of the app due to the appeal and simplicity of use. I‚Äôm a firm believer that if you use small habits over time you are more apt to stick with them. I‚Äôm also bipolar and a schedule is an absolute need in my life. 

So, in the afternoon and evening (the morning is already set up within the app) I made a list of three to four things I could easily accomplish, and they wouldn‚Äôt take up a lot of time to do. The only thing I can‚Äôt figure out is how to add to the afternoon and evening lists if I want to.

The app also keeps you accountable as well. You HAVE to check off what you‚Äôve done in order to get credit for the day. I love that feature. It has a push feature to send you notifications throughout the day. 

The menu is easy to navigate. It‚Äôs a simple scroll feature which doesn‚Äôt leave you searching all over the place for ticking off boxes as your day goes on. For the first week it gives you a little story that you travel through which is a nice little touch.

Why 4 stars?  This app is designed and targets females which isn‚Äôt a bad bias, but doesn‚Äôt completely help the male audience.  If for example i could choose which gender (male/female) was using the app, the examples might make more sense.

Love It! Only one criticism.,"Love this app!! This is the first app that I have actually felt was relevant and applied to my life and my personality and wasn‚Äôt a pain actually completing the goals I set. I am sincerely grateful to the creators of this app. I am turning 40 yrs old soon and I needed serious change and I wanted it done by my 40th birthday. I honestly feel that I will accomplish my goal now and I know it‚Äôs due to Fabulous! 

My only complaint is that I think that this app should allow full access for 14 days before committing to any subscription or asking for payment info. Once I started my new routines and saw that I was actually working on myself due to this app, all I wanted to do was share it with my children, my family, and friends. I know tho that none of my family would see the benefit because of it asking for subscription and payment at the very beginning even with the 30 day pass I sent out. 

Otherwise I recommend this to everyone and anyone that honestly and wholeheartedly wants to change their daily routines, their self esteem, or anything about themselves or lives for the better.

Helpful with Bipolar ‚Äî Needs a Couple Updates,"I have never written an app review before but this warrants it. 

They say one of the best things to help with bipolar disorder is to set a firm routine and this app has helped me tremendously with that. I feel like I have accomplished something just by completing little daily tasks and keeping on schedule. It tells you to celebrate your little victories and this is a huge plus for me. Gratification has always been an issue of mine. I love it for that. 

The only things that I would amend would be something like a ‚Äúvacation mode‚Äù because when I am away or I have company I‚Äôm not always able to achieve each of my daily goals. This makes me feel like I haven‚Äôt done enough with my day. The inability to do that task sets me back.

"Confusing App, terrible layout/UI","I really wanted to love this app - I was looking for something to help form habits and make small improvements. This seemed perfect and I pushed forward, purchasing an annual subscription. I regret this. 

The user experience is terrible. It‚Äôs INCREDIBLY confusing when you first start using the app and it‚Äôs difficult to want to use because it‚Äôs just so cluttered. 

You can only do one journey or goal at a time - which is totally fine - but it doesn‚Äôt really *show* you what it wants you to do at any given point in the journey. The app is also super intrusive ‚Äî if you go to check off an item or complete a task, it‚Äôll suddenly blast out sound with some cheesy letter (the voice acting/graphics are atrocious and make the whole thing feel cheap). At first, I was constantly silencing my phone or quickly closing out the app whenever I checked something off. It‚Äôs definitely not something you can effectively use without headphones in non-private spaces. 

But again, it‚Äôs just sooo confusing. You can see everything you can‚Äôt actually do yet (or shouldn‚Äôt - as it recommends), which clutters up the entire home screen and makes the things you‚Äôre actually using less accessible.

I was hoping for something a little more guided, a lot simpler, and a whole lot more focused. Each letter is like 3/4 of uninspired writing mixed with heaps of filler.  I‚Äôm really disappointed.",2,2021-01-27 08:20:19,courtney 15,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

During the few days of the free trial, I did the water drinking challenge and great breakfast challenge, and I used the launch feature for running and ‚Äúdeep work.‚Äù While I did find that they were motivating, I didn‚Äôt think it was anything I couldn‚Äôt accomplish on my own with a regular timer.

Poor Support / Cancellation & Reimbursement,"I will start by admitting that I was under the misleading impression of how canceling my service worked.

Yes, they make the renewal dates and charges clear, I wasn‚Äôt confused about when and how much. I accept that I should have canceled yesterday, but to be so obvious w/ the lack of care of my mistake when you‚Äôre charging someone annually, not even just monthly, is absurd to me and telling of the value of the company. 

This is a self care app, it promotes a healthy well-being and one of the ways is through reducing stress. This charge is causing me so and it seems their support team doesn‚Äôt care and have no intentions to help. It seems very hypocritical given the purpose of the app they run.

My experience w/ the app itself wasn‚Äôt even satisfying enough for me to consider keeping the subscription so I‚Äôm basically out of money and stuck w/ a service I don‚Äôt want and again, they do not care.

This is the most well-built app I've ever used. The creators clearly know their stuff and everything in it is useful and simple.

 Some suggestions for this app:
1. One time goals - Allow us to set one time goals too instead of habits that we do every day. Maybe let us tap on a day on the calendar to set our separate goals.
2. More exercises in Make Me Fabulous - There are only 3 exercises except 1-Min ""Just Get Moving!"" and Sphere Running exercises. We need more!
3. Let us set time for individual habits - Setting time for individual habits will help us do them before it's too late... Happened to me couple of times when I decided I'd do most of my habits together later in the day but was too tired to complete them.

It has helped me increase my water intake, got me back reading for pleasure (which I haven‚Äôt done in years), & just generally makes me feel positive. It can be a bit difficult to navigate the app & I missed out on inputting my first two days of success of my morning routine. But I got the hang of it fairly quickly. I‚Äôve only used it for a couple of weeks but I believe these small incremental changes will help me live a healthier life. As someone who is completely unmotivated, Fabulous gives me a much-needed push. It may seem a bit metaphysical & new agey & some of the coaching sessions are downright treacly.

Good for ADHD brain!,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with adult ADHD fairly recently, and have since been seeking out resources to help me stay on track. I need to learn how to schedule daily tasks more effectively so that I have more time and motivation to meet my larger goals. I‚Äôve only been using this app for 4 or 5 days, but so far it has been really helping with my morning routine! Within 30 minutes of waking up I have already had a glass of water, taken my pills and vitamins, washed up and brushed my teeth, checked my weight, and fed and watered my kitties! That feels like a big step because often times I wouldn‚Äôt have finished all of those tasks until late morning or noontime, if I would finish each task at all.

The layout could use improvement,"The app in itself is amazing......like it actually is helping me change my habits so far, but some more features could make it near perfect:
‚Ä¢ Setting am alarm for each habit would be amazing. I know you can do it in your regular alarm app, but having it in fabulous stitched to their system which can also be customized will be amazing.
‚Ä¢ Keep on with the animated letters. So before this , a letter used to come and I would ignore it. But this time it has animations just in case you need pretty visuals. Keep on with that. It is working amazingly for me.
The only con I am seeing so far for this app is that the layout is very messy. Like you have the progress bar which tracks your progress but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it is part of that (like it doesn‚Äôt need to be there and is like an extra). And the pathway I am talking about is like the Day one day two thing with the fabulous spirit floating around each day as you finish a habit. It is not needed tbh. Remove that and keep the one which just tracks your one new helps for three days.

Other than that, this app is amazing and i can recommend it to anyone who is looking into self care...... just these changes can make me go for a 5 star",4,2020-08-24 18:28:53,Little_Muskaan,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

As someone in the field of behavioral psychology and education, once I heard this app concentrated on behavioral science, I knew I had to get it.

It reminds me of the game ‚ÄúJourney‚Äù by Thatgamecompany. It‚Äôs one of my favorite games and I‚Äôm unsure if the similarities were on purpose, but I love that it works with my association with the game nonetheless!

TL/DR: Be careful if you do the free trial, or skip it altogether if you can. 

The subscription was confusing. I tried to cancel it before I got charged, but there wasn‚Äôt an option in my settings.

I‚Äôve been using this app for a couple days now and I honestly love it! I‚Äôm very skeptical about a lot of apps that promote wellbeing and health but I just felt something different about this app and I decided to take a risk! 
Best decision I made! It makes me feel more motived in the morning and it‚Äôs really enjoyable to watch the videos.

Yes, you will have to pay to get the full experience, which comes out to be like $3 a month (a cup of coffee) if you break it down from the annual cost, so I think it is totally worth it.

"It Started Out Great, but....","Current review: When I first downloaded this app I truly enjoyed it. It kept me on track and I was hitting my daily goals. But then an update occurred, and this app had been pretty useless since then. First, it messed up my streak of days, which was frustrating, but I could just continue to be productive. However, most of what I like about the app disappeared with the update. It wasn‚Äôt as inspirational or encouraging as before. The cool info graphics stopped showing up and a lot of the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù didn‚Äôt work. For an app that I paid for, it stopped being worth the money. Now it‚Äôs a glorified checklist that you have to pay for. I have cancelled my subscription and will be deleting this from my phone.

Sweet concept but the marketing ruins it!,"The design and concept of the app is creative and has a sweet atmosphere, but the ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù integration of marketing throughout is so off-putting! If part of my journey is to send a note of gratitude to someone, that‚Äôs wonderful. But that narrative  just sugar coats that its actually just an ad for the app we are prompted to share to draw in more customers. 
I thought the ‚Äúgift pass‚Äù was a really sweet idea too, until I sent it to a few people and it turns out it‚Äôs another marketing scheme. Please don't call it a gift to pass on to others if the gift receiver is obliged to enter credit card details.

I understand that as an app you want to grow your user base and ideally a growing community around the app, but if you're going to undermine people‚Äôs awareness and ruin the actual experience that is supposed to be a thoughtful personal exploration of growth and healthy habit building, by integrating your own marketing ‚Äústrategies‚Äù right into the process, that is not a journey I want to participate in, sorry. 

Having said that, I do like the overall creative concept of the app and the idea behind it, so I will continue to use it during the trial period but if I keep finding more of those integrated marketing tasks reframed as a part of my journey It might be too off-putting to dive in.",2,2020-09-29 11:20:33,LW flow,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

The little things in this app help you the most, it starts by telling you to put a glass of water by your bed every night or in the morning (whatever time you chose it to notify you) and if you go through with it...after a week you start to feel pretty good about yourself and are inspired to keep up the good work.

Suggestion #2: put more detail into the yoga/stretching/workout activities.

That aside, the free version is pretty handy! There are plenty of practical prompts to help build yourself a healthier routine and the design is pleasant to look at and navigate.

The problem I have with most of these apps (or self-help books like Tiny Habits), is they either overwhelm with too much information and visuals at once, or they're presented simply enough, but then come with a list of notes to take, ways to journal, things to do to track the thing you're doing... 

I love what the app is attempting though, and the mystery it presents and immerses you in. I just think it needs to be simplified.

This ones different. With the carefully laid out paths and attached stories, I actually find myself coming back day after day. And the pacing has been just right to not overwhelm things.

All of the goals are in small increments but are very empowering. I have come to look forward to celebrating the good things I do each morning and evening, as well as the regular coaching.

Also the checking off of tasks or goals is weirdly arranged. Is it a check off or a fabulous moment? Or both? The coaching and other extras are also oddly placed.

Surprisingly meaningful,"This app, while very unusual, has probably been the most meaningful one I‚Äôve ever been downloaded/purchased, as it‚Äôs been a big source of foundational habits. 

I used to drink 5 Diet Cokes and a coffee a day. Now I mostly just drink ice water, and no caffeine. For the last few years, I‚Äôve make a to do list most days in a notebook, and I prioritize it quickly and identify the three things I really want to get done. When I‚Äôm stressed, I now do some sort of meditation and I find I can focus better. 

All these are things I learned to do seriously in this app. Lately, for really the first time, I‚Äôve started a regular exercise program. It really feels like it may be something I keep up with, unlike my many earlier attempts. 

There are plenty of goofy/questionable suggestions, some journeys (healthy eating?) that just don‚Äôt seem terribly effective, some other ones that just won‚Äôt end, and about a billion references to Teddy Roosevelt for some reason.

Disappointed,"This app is difficult to navigate and messy, which if you‚Äôre trying to build good habits is bad. I would go as far as saying if you have anxiety this app might trigger it. While trying to use the app I‚Äôm just overwhelmed with constant random substance-less features and it becomes difficult to even do basic navigation and get back to where you just were in the app, there‚Äôs no clear direction,  constant pop up style interactions and animations clutter and confuse. 
It‚Äôs a shame that distracting, messy, unclear design was chosen over functionality (exactly what people who need this app need). 

It also asked me what I want to stop using in the questionnaire, social media was one of only 2 options so I picked that, anything I do on this app it asks me to share on social media. I downloaded this app to improve myself, Im not interested in giving you free advertising, and that shouldn‚Äôt be on the table anyway for a user that has flagged social media as a trouble area.

Perhaps worst of all is that It has faux science, for example, it based a bad habit section on astrology, apparently I drink too much coffee since I‚Äôm a Gemini. I‚Äôm serious this was in the app, very very very disappointing for a ‚Äòscience based‚Äô app

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I wish there was another deep study session sound that lasts for longer.

However, my problem as a user is that there are too many screens and clickable items for you that you can easily lost in the app. 

One of the most confusing parts for me is that I have no idea that what will happen next after clicking on something. Sometimes you could end up getting 2 or 3 more new action items within that! Im honestly scared to click on anything...

Instead of having so many options (too much of customization for what user want to achieve with this app) I‚Äôd rather selecting from a few options on ‚Äúwhy I wanna use this app (my goal)‚Äù and then having a clear path that unlocks step by step and help me to focus on that goal.

A game changer.,"Re-read the title, because it‚Äôs true.

Perhaps you don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúforward‚Äù means or is. 

That‚Äôs ok. 

Fabulous has done work on that and can help you select your path / journey; but, get this, also help you re-direct your journey (even just temporarily) when need be.

"Great design, needs some customization","I‚Äôm currently using the free version but it‚Äôs quite limited. That‚Äôs fair and I appreciate all the work put into various parts of the app. The daily reminders, Journey Roadmaps and especially having guided meditation/exercise/yoga all rolled into the same app seems great.

My main issue is that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to track things weekly or monthly. Daily routine is a good place to start, but this app clearly tries to take a holistic approach in changing your life. I think that naturally lends itself to building habits that may happen with a longer time frame.
Eg. Pay bills on time, go out with friends X times per month, go to the gym 3 times per week.

I would definitely pay for this app if it had that option. And it seems like a much easier thing to implement than some of the current features.

Unfortunately, the app is very cluttery and visually distracting. It creates false storylines and posts complicated moving graphics on every page of the app. For someone with ADD, it's visually overstimulating, and it distracts me from forming my own neurological links and memories surrounding my own life story.  Visually lovely, but not useful for quick and decisive action.

The app also notified me daily about tasks that I had already completed and checked off, which undermines the sense of accomplishment.  Disappointing and frustrating.  üòï",2,2021-04-03 10:18:06,NicknamesAllTook,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
I would use this if there wasn't a million popups,"Whenever this app is advertised it is a clean and simple UI where you simply check off your daily habits. SOUNDS FANTASTIC

Actually using the app entails closing out of or reading through tons of ""motivational"" popups and weird letters of encouragement. These might be nice if they didn't appear right when you were trying to fill your check list. Make them an optional little side notification to explore, not a requirement to use the app.

You can't add more than 4 habits to your list unless you pay for premium.

You cant go back to the morning/afternoon if you forget to check off the habit then (even though you did it) which then messes up your progress through the app (which allows you to unlock extra habits and features) 

There doesn't seem to be a cohesive place to look at progress in a meaningful way, instead there are ""chapters"" that are nature themed and reminiscent of candy crush levels.

I love the idea behind this app, and it‚Äôs beautifully designed, but as a guy, it‚Äôs distracting to see the graphics constantly showing me as a young girl. Why even bother asking our gender in the first place?

So-so so far,"I‚Äôve used a lot of these types of apps. While this concept is very intriguing, there is still a lot to be desired and some bugs that need to be worked out. I‚Äôve reported two so far and have yet to hear back. 

Pros: 
- It starts you out with easy to attain goals
- There‚Äôs a social aspect (though the post I submitted was lost and there‚Äôs no where to view your own posts)
- let‚Äôs you customize your routines (can‚Äôt seem to delete the one you want though, at least for me. Submitted this to support and waiting for a response still)
- a lot of variety to choose from for adding to your routines
- comes with challenges (like cutting sugar, alcohol and even live challenges that let you participate with others)
- not toxic positivity 

Cons:
- There‚Äôs a social aspect 
- the reminders could be more ‚Äúpushy‚Äù 
- support is lackluster
- the price is pretty high and in my trial so far I‚Äôve yet to see the $50/year value (but I still have a few days left)

Secondly, the app keeps you from doing most things until you have read a lesson and answered a question about whether you agree. They also play cute videos at the end to tell you about your journey.

Besides daily habits you can choose from, it has behavioral science structure in place where it will encourage you, and set you up with mechanics to foster long term success. Bc most people do want to make positive changes but it is hard to be motivated all along.

I also like the poster after each action. It‚Äôs so simple, informative and great illustration in macaroon colors!

I especially like the ‚Äòchallenge project‚Äô where you can choose your own focus, and join a community of people who shares their progress and struggles. I am doing 5-day decluttering challenge. First day is to ask yourself ‚Äôwhat ideas/thoughts are holding you back?‚Äô

It‚Äôs frustrating because you cannot edit the past days when the software does that kind of mistakes.

I contacted support a couple of time about it and it took forever for them to give me a half baked answer. I don‚Äôt think they care about that issue.

I wish there was a journal tab that I can click on and it would pull up all my entries from previous days (with the topics/area you were working on) 

The second, I wish there was a save or favoriting sections for articles, reading things of the activities. These only appear at the time you click on the new habit/ exercise and once you click complete they are gone.

Grows:
- I don‚Äôt find the app interface particularly intuitive, easy to hit a button and get somewhere I didn‚Äôt expect

The fabulous app started out by encouraging me to drink water every morning when I woke up. That was so simple, and easy, I couldn‚Äôt say no. It felt good to track my progress and unlock encouraging, and inspiring videos.
Eventually my morning routine also included exercising, and cleaning my room for 5 minutes. This has given me so much energy! I feel productive, excited, and like anything is possible! 
I can eat an ENTIRE ELEPHANT! It happens one bite at a time. 

Thank you, Fabulous app, for giving a new zeal for life, and the confidence to chase my dreams!",5,2020-05-16 05:16:44,Ex mafia fan,False,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Commit to pay then sample politics,"Beware, you are committing to paying first then sample preliminary content, which is to drink water every morning.

Unexpectedly surprised,"I‚Äôm really enjoying the app. Honestly I had very low expectations terms of its ability to improve my life and how I feel. And I definitely didn‚Äôt think it would actually impact my day to day habits. I‚Äôve been suffering from extreme  burnout, and have tried a variety of approaches to mitigate the effect on my professional and personal life, including taking vacation without much change. Somehow since using this app, I‚Äôm now going on my third week, I have actually been feeling a little more positive, energized and motivated to work every day. This app has helped me design a routine and stick to it. Who knew that was possible. I magically seem to remember to do the habits because of their methodology. Furthermore the structure prioritizes my personal needs at the time of starting the program which was my own health and some other parts of life that are important to me but are often neglected and end up on the bottom of my to do list. It‚Äôs a bit surreal to think that since I began using this app, my work responsibilities and life balance has become more manageable and consistent but it absolutely has. It definitely didn‚Äôt happen over night and was impatient to see results immediately the first week, but after week two there has been considerable decrease in burnout symptoms and I look forward to completing the morning and afternoon routines so that I can mark them complete in the app. I was very skeptical and part of me would have thought the improvements were just placebo, but it‚Äôs really not. And at this point there haven‚Äôt been any other changes in my life much less anything that would create a positive sustainable difference in my day to day life other than the Fabulous app. Because the improvements began to occur when I began using the app and has continued to progress slowly (but with patience) since then.

The best habit tracker,"I‚Äôve never been so impressed with what an app could accomplish in my life. It‚Äôs too underrated and should get more love... this is the best thing that‚Äôs happened to me in quarantine! First of all, unlike other apps which only let you pick 3 or 5 habits, this lets you pick a total of 9, spread out into morning, afternoon, and evening routines. They limit you to three for each ritual at first to keep you motivated but later they‚Äôll slowly add more for you as you continue on your journey. I even sent feedback only for a misunderstanding in the app, but the answer I received was thoroughly written. I could tell that they actually cared about my experience, so thanks for that! Fabulous is also (fabulous) at making my habits stick. When I used Productive, it gave me no motivators whatsoever so I was forced to push myself. But I‚Äôm lazy...so I couldn‚Äôt really do that, and I ended up just not completing any of my habits and discouraging myself. Fabulous has what they call a Fabulous Moment, where it pushes you to do everything at once. Having a timer for each habit is also very helpful. They even send you letters from your ‚Äúfuture self‚Äù and so on to motivate you even further. The Coaching tab was so much more detailed than I thought it would be! And best of all, you don‚Äôt have to pay for any of the features I mentioned! They offer pretty nice stuff in Premium, however. One thing I would suggest is to make it an option to view the days of the week on the home screen so you can tap them and check off which ones you completed if you forgot to on that day. Productive had this option, but this is just a suggestion to make this app even more efficient!

Pretty good,"I feel there are many things this app can help with. Especially in the new year resolution area. Mine was to be more aware of what I wasn‚Äôt taking advantage of and setting routines for a better, more productive life. I always say I will take care of something, or I need to work out, or I wish I could have more time for me. This app, so far, is starting slowly to get me into that mindset of setting a routine daily. Now, there are some quirks to the app as how fast it may be taking you, and it really depends on your life, when you get up, and what your schedule looks like daily. This is more driven for people working the 9-5 jobs, whereas I work 6-3. I really hope this works to help me in my continued growth, and I‚Äôm learning slowly to change my life for the best one yet. 

I understand what they are aiming to do with the app, just wish it would stretch the challenges a little farther, instead of 3 days and a new routine, maybe every 5-7 days so I can get used to the idea of say, drinking water every morning. I like taking it slow, getting used to the idea, manipulating it and being excited about it, but within 7 days I‚Äôve got 4 things they want me to be doing before going into work! Plus, maybe I‚Äôm not seeing all of the options, but I wish I could opt out of a challenge or snooze it for just a few days, let me get my head wrapped around the idea of my new routine, then I can progress with my journey. I have purchased the premium membership, I plan on using this to help me with my routines and mindsets, and I am committed to using the app. So just little things I‚Äôve seen after the 7 initial days.

Overall, I believe in the end this will help me, but I do see where some won‚Äôt benefit and see it as more a burden daily. It‚Äôs a daily app that wants you to be committed, so if you‚Äôre not fully ready for a change, don‚Äôt purchase the premium, but definitely try the app out! They give you 7 day free trial, and with that it seems like the best app I‚Äôve seen to help with self improvement.

Customer service - NOT,"I've used Fabulous for years and absolutely love it... when it works, but customer support seems non-existent when it doesn't. On the one hand, it has worked for me most of the time, but it recently broke when I migrated to a new phone. Short version of the break - As long as I stay on my current journey I'm fine, but when I try to switch to a new challenge it requires me to sign in to my account (which I'm already signed into) and then it freezes. This is in spite of having followed the instructions for switching to a new device. I get that things happen, but the only option for customer support is an email in the app and responses are extremely slow, if you even get a response. I know because this is the third time I've contacted support. The first time they took weeks before getting back to me and the second request was a simple question that I sent them four days ago and haven't heard back. So, I'm not surprised I haven't heard from them in 24 hours about the break, but I am more frustrated this time because this issue prevents me from fully using the app. I will add that when I asked on the app's FB page the simple question about what time of day daily coaching was posted, my post was disapproved, within just a few hours, the moderator told me it was inappropriate for the FB group's purpose, and I was directed to use the help function in the app, which of course has received no response.

I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm feeling too Fabulous,"I agree with one of the other users who suggested allowing you to say ‚ÄúI already do this habit‚Äù would be helpful. If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôm okay with keeping the habit, but amp it up with another option. The story telling is nice, but I‚Äôm not feeling super motivated by it. I like the quotes much better where I can journal my thoughts alongside it. I also really like the guides and other suggestions that pop up that I can even quickly post on Instagram or save in my phone. However, I am currently having a hard time even locating them at the moment. I could have sworn yesterday there was a way for me to go back to them. I would prefer prompts that keep me more interested and then have a place to go back to and access them again or a place where I can better see my daily progress outside of just the journey prompt with the habits. I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôll keep the subscription after the 7 day trial. It‚Äôs a nice app and I do like being forced to slow down and ease into the goals since I‚Äôm often overloading myself with goals, but I don‚Äôt feel that challenged. You can‚Äôt build on a challenge and keep the habit, but maybe that‚Äôs the point that I‚Äôm not fully grasping. I‚Äôm not fully bought in because it hasn‚Äôt fully peaked my interest. It would be nice if the app maybe asked a series of questions and tried to learn a little more about you before it forced you into a specific set of habits to follow that may not apply to you. I have tried other apps that I like much better. This one is falling short for me.
