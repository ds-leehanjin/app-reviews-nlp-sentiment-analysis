Game Changer,2021-03-26 05:17:55,False,"I am a 24 year old nurse with mental health issues and I have a couple of bad habits I‚Äôve been trying to eradicate for months. I‚Äôve tried dozens of apps from habit streaks to accountability apps to online counseling. I installed this app with the intent to explore it and nothing else. But this app is so cleverly designed, it is hard not to love. There are attractive features in this app that will help you build positive habits. Yet, I believe the real hook is the story about you that develops, which happens when you successfully complete your goals. This app does an excellent job of not just making you think, but making you do, which is what I think is the epitome of mental health. It doesn‚Äôt just strive to improve your mental health, it strives to improve your overall function. The app engages you in multiple ways, which sets it apart from the traditional templates of regular one-on-one convos with people who only roundabout with Pinterest-like ‚Äúinspirational sayings.‚Äù I‚Äôm genuinely more motivated, more functional, and have made more changes in my life the past two weeks since I‚Äôve downloaded this app than I have in the last three years. Fabulous mysteriously makes it fun to remind you to be yourself and be healthy and happy at the same time, and keeping those streaks up can be pretty satisfying too. However you use this app, whether it‚Äôs for a day or for a year - strive to commit to it, and you will reach your happiness.",Elijah.Luis,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Inspirational,2020-06-11 03:21:05,False,"I truly do love this app. I have been using it for about a week now, and it has been more helpful than any other app I have tried. I am a young mother to two young boys, I work full time, and go to school full time. I have struggled for years now to learn how to take better care of myself due to my priorities are always making sure my children are taken care of while my health and wellness, both mentally and physically, took the back seat. For the first time in my life, I am actually creating healthy routines for myself. In the morning, I meditate, drink a glass of water, take my vitamins, and stretch. In the evenings I tidy up, read for 30 minutes and write down what went well today. And I‚Äôm still only using the free version! I think that is the best thing of all. Due to a strict budget, I cannot afford the premium version of Fabulous at the moment. However, I can still access a lot of the features that are essential to me bettering myself through this process. This also allows me to make sure that this app is everything I need it to be before I make the hefty $50 yearly subscription (I know $50 is not a lot by any means, I just can‚Äôt afford that right nowü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and that‚Äôs okay! Because I can still thankfully do everything I need to do starting out. I sincerely appreciate the developers of this app, and I hope to stay with Fabulous for many years to come!‚ò∫Ô∏è",Izehbelle,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
This app is worth it,2021-04-13 17:03:02,False,"I had previously come across this app in the past, downloaded it to see what the hype was and instantly deleted. Recently I came across this user who had recommended using fabulous to get back on track, and creating good, healthy habits. I‚Äôve always been a routined person, but would fall off and struggle to keep track or stay on track. I would beat myself up and feel disappointed that I had to start over. After taking some needed time off for myself (especially during the pandemic) I am and have been working on myself to heal by getting back into creating healthy and happy routine for a better life. 

Just recently downloading this app (again) I wanted to put this to the test. Only after about a week of using this app, I will say that this app is by far one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs so gentle but so rewarding and honest about life and being ‚ÄúO.K.‚Äù With falling off track, making mistakes, counting the small wins, feeing appreciative, but the biggest one is making me believe in myself more by becoming the best version of myself. Mental health is so important and this app makes you feel like the darks do happen, but you can always come out on top. 

So if I had to say what is an app that works and I‚Äôm willing to spend the money...well, you‚Äôve come to the right place.",Mommakelz17,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Skeptically positive,2021-04-12 01:02:45,False,I actually got this app a couple months ago when I needed so positive affirmations or medications to just kind of get through the day... as I started slinking a little further into a pretty dark depression I didn‚Äôt use it I actually deleted it for a bit and frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt get into to app. I thought this little story‚Äôs were annoying... then a few weeks back I had gotten so bad I wasn‚Äôt eating or taking care of my self at all I started searching for routine apps to just try and get myself taking care of myself to feel better... As I was searching I saw this app pop up and I remembered it did have routines as well. I re downloaded it and I can actually say for the last few weeks of using it. I‚Äôm starting to like the story‚Äôs and the guidance because I WAS READY... had I reviewed this app a couple months ago it wouldn‚Äôt have been positive because that‚Äôs not where I was... but I can now say thank you! Because this app is really helping me build better habits and stay on task and I check back on it often and now listen to the story‚Äôs because I know it‚Äôs going to get me to that next level of taking care of myself. As a Mom/Wife/ and in Management... Who has time for that? Right. Thanks again for a program that‚Äôs actually working for me.,MrsPrado,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Not based on Myers Briggs,2021-07-06 12:35:49,False,"I saw a Facebook ad saying this app worked to develop habits based on the Myers Briggs personality test. I was intrigued and downloaded the app. In the 30+ days I used it, Myers Briggs never came up. The app was just . . . random and weird. There was even a session where the app developer acknowledged that his beta testers gave him that feedback and the app developer just ignored their feedback. Kind of a ‚Äúyou be you‚Äùpep talk. 

The habits the app picked for me to develop I already had. Like drinking water in the morning. There wasn‚Äôt an option to tell the app I already drink water and move on. The app kept inviting me to join certain challenges but the app said there was only one day left in the challenge so I waited. The app invited me again to the same challenge and it was still one day left in the challenge! I think maybe the challenge was only a one day thing? But that was confusing. 

I got a 7-day trial to start but when I canceled, I immediately got an email offering a 30-day trial. So try that if you want to try to app longer. It was a little annoying that the app kept telling me to invite others (when I‚Äôd only been on the app for a few days) and they would get a 30-day trial but I only got a 7-day trial. It was easy to cancel the 30-day trial before I got charged. I just logged into my account from a web browser and that was all the website was, my account with the option to cancel clearly there on the website. So that was good.",Spunky2637,2,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Awesome App!!!!,2020-01-25 12:56:35,False,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this app.  I‚Äôve been in therapy for years for some losses etc. I‚Äôve currently been enrolled in a DBT course,8 weeks to get through 4modules.  You can‚Äôt reach knowledge or gain enough practice to be great at this in one course.  This app you have here is the perfect in between classes to work with as extra coping mechanisms..  it brings in soooo much helpful information for personal care and development.  It‚Äôs very easy to use.  For me, it is not overwhelming, you can do as much or as little as you want during the 3 parts of your days.  It has given me more practice in becoming one mindful where everybody should learn.  This mindfulness can be done in 5 minutes or less or longer.  It‚Äôs giving your mind a break.  Instead of racing around thoughts, you learn to focus and remain calm.  The meditations here are very easy to sit back and listen.  I‚Äôve even been so relaxed I fell asleep which is very hard for me to do.  It has done wonders in just these few days to work with your app.  I love the challenges!  I also like the way you can choose what you want for your daily routine.  If what you offer isn‚Äôt enough you provide a way for us to add our own routines in, if it‚Äôs not working on the list.

Glitching out,2021-03-10 17:40:42,False,"If this app was working right, it would be a five star app. But it is not and has not been for about two weeks. It‚Äôs been glitching, not allowing me to access today‚Äôs list of goals and routines to check off. My daily coaching option that‚Äôs on my routines no longer brings anything up to play for the day and instead just has a list of activities you could bring up. I bought the lifetime subscription and I‚Äôm kicking myself for it now that nothing is working on it. I‚Äôve been using this app on and off for five years among varying devices without glitching issues and now all the sudden now that I‚Äôm on day 34 or so on my current journey, it‚Äôs just decided it no longer needs to work. 
Another annoying thing is that if you forget to mark the things off as you‚Äôre doing them and decide to mark it off later, it doesn‚Äôt seem to count it the same as though you didn‚Äôt actually do anything but are just checking it off. I find this incredibly annoying. Not everyone has time to stare at their phone after every activity on their list and check it off. I‚Äôm a busy person. Some of us want to check it off later, that doesn‚Äôt mean we didn‚Äôt do it when we are supposed to. Good lord.
Also, I‚Äôve had to uninstall and reinstall this app several times just to get it to work. I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that. There‚Äôs plenty of space on my phone and everything else works fine. Why is this app so glitchy?!",Only Lee Bay,2,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

2/5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è is frankly generous for this unFABULOUS disappointment! This app over-promises and under-delivers, while exploiting as many individuals as possible by tricking you into forfeiting your privacy, for the lab's own benefit.

My Saving Grace,2020-11-24 13:58:08,False,"One of my biggest issues is feeling lost even tho my business gives me a sense of purpose I‚Äôm all alone in the basement and have no schedule. I always thought my life would be different. Now I know it‚Äôs up to me to execute the life I one day will have but not to worry about it or dwell on my past but literally just live day to day improving myself and loving myself and laughing and being grateful and giving each step of the way. That‚Äôs how you live. Fabulous is helping me get some structure because I sort of just get lost sometimes not knowing when or how to accomplish things. Like do I really have to go to bank everyday?

My phone can be a curse but it‚Äôs been directing and guiding me lately, I‚Äôm so out of touch w the world cuz I‚Äôve kept myself so isolated all these years.

Life Saver,2020-02-19 07:27:26,False,"I‚Äôve never been the type of person to steer towards the ‚Äúself-help‚Äù or ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù section. In the last year, however, I began a journey of self discovery. It wasn‚Äôt on purpose. It just sort of happened. The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. Some things need to change entirely. Some things I didn‚Äôt even realize that I was doing. This app is so well researched and written. The content is amazing. Especially for someone like me who is usually a total skeptic. I decided to give it a shot, and I am actually seeing results. I have always been a cynic, pessimist, and grew more and more neurotic as I got older. That pattern kept growing until I would have bouts of depression that I literally could not get out of. Spirals of self destruction, and I couldn‚Äôt stop the thoughts. Well, let me tell you - the thoughts will creep up. But I check myself. It‚Äôs starting to come more naturally now. My brain is like ‚Äúhey, where do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù, and it stops all that negative stuff in it‚Äôs tracks. I‚Äôve never been able to do that before. It‚Äôs absolutely stunning.

Great app,2020-06-03 22:39:21,False,"During the 7 day trial I found myself making better habits to help myself out during the day especially my morning routine. I work a night shift and have to balance out my day accordingly but this app really helped me with that with the alerts for something that used to escapes my mind early in the morning, which is to drink water it became a great habit I developed even when I‚Äôm off of work I still wake up and drink water which keeps me on the same schedule. With all the options for: the morning, afternoon, and evening routines, it‚Äôs getting a little used to but none the less I‚Äôm gaining better habits to help me throughout my day. I can say I appreciate this app and look forward to gaining my life back with healthier decisions. The only bad thing I can say about the app is when you mark that you did an activity that you did not complete, the app won‚Äôt allow you to undo that you completed it, so for someone like me who is openly honest about what I do, it will get a little frustrating to know you didn‚Äôt complete that goal for that day but everything else on this app is great and to me life saving.

***RIPOFF***SCAM***THIEVES,2021-05-28 21:58:14,False,"Tried this app last year and didn‚Äôt find it all that motivating. No worries‚Ä¶everyone has their preferences. Forgot to cancel before my free 30 day trial was up. No worries‚Ä¶that‚Äôs on me. But I made sure to go in and cancel right away so I wouldn‚Äôt make the same mistake again.

So finally, I responded to one of them and reminded them that they did not have an active credit card on file because I was no longer an active account holder.

"Beautiful UI, bad UX",2021-01-02 21:48:28,False,"So the path of slow and steady incremental changes makes a ton of sense. The kinds of tasks it seems like the app orients on, also seem well founded and useful. However, the way you interact with the app itself to achieve those ends is so confusing and unintuitive to me. There‚Äôs no one place to look at what I‚Äôve achieved or how I‚Äôm doing, or which goals I might choose. Even after using it for a few days, I‚Äôm still unsure of where to find any succinct information or even which buttons I should be pressing. In addition, the way it offers me the option to make goals and follow up with those goals just doesn‚Äôt match the natural way I make decisions or the flow of my day. 
For example, I‚Äôd see the notification to drink water with bleary eyes immediately after waking up, but before my brain can comprehend. Then it disappears into the fog of slowly waking. This morning, I finally did get myself to immediately open the app and log that I drank water, then it promptly opened a loud animated cut scene which was pretty annoying for me, but even more annoying for the person asleep next to me. I hastily closed the whole thing. 
I‚Äôd really like to utilize the set of slow and consistent reminders that seem to be at the heart of this app, but what does it matter if I can‚Äôt actually figure out how to use it?

App quality has gone down,2020-07-07 17:25:00,False,"I‚Äôve been a member for over a year. Over the past 6 months the app has repeatedly frozen up, routines open without the habits loading with them, the habits being checked off on the watch but not reflecting in the mobile app, and the app completely crashing. I really like the content but the app is starting to heavily detract from the experience. At some point the pain of switching is less than the pain of staying. I‚Äôm a Dev so I get that this kind of app isn‚Äôt easy to build, but the foundations have to be solid.

You guys desperately need a feature freeze so the entire dev and design team can focus on fixing what is already there. Cleaning up the design, removing buttons that don‚Äôt need to be there, removing concepts that make no sense etc. (I have yet to understand the differences between sphere, premium, journeys and challenges). Simple things are painful, like how do I leave/end a challenge, how to I delete a routine? You mean we need to start another challenge just to end the current one? Why am I even given the option to join a challenge when the first journey isn‚Äôt done?

For all the talk about fabulous being like an instrument, and the need to learn new words to use it, fabulous is pretty bad at teaching those new concepts.

Terrible company and customer service.,2020-01-05 14:48:04,False,"This company is in the business of stealing people‚Äôs money. Not only is their app ridiculously expensive, they don‚Äôt offer refunds for accidental auto renewal, or if you did not like the app. EVERY other company I have ever had experience with will offer refunds if you are not happy with their service, if it did not meet your expectations, and especially if you were accidentally paying for an app for an entire year beyond when you ever even opened the app. It is clear to me that they cannot afford to be in this business if they are going to rob their customers of their money when they aren‚Äôt happy with the service. Again, I have experience with many many apps and services and everytime I have asked for a refund I get it, no. questions. asked.  The fact that this company has the audacity to tell me they are keeping my money when I don‚Äôt even have the app still downloaded on my phone is mind blowing to me. Get out of this business, you aren‚Äôt helping people, you are robbing me.  My auto renewal was on Dec 30th and I emailed them days later. they are keeping my money for the entire 2020 year.

The Jump Start I NEEDED,2020-11-12 17:27:13,False,"I used to live my ~dream~ life and I had my set of habits that worked. I was always in a great space and nothing could have brought me down.

Since then I‚Äôve been trying to get the motivation or the will to do the things I love and I always feel the need to start it all at once which is difficult and unrealistic. Bit this app has made that more of a reality. I might get a later start to my day since I‚Äôm still just trying but the practices and talks on this app, the realization that motivation isn‚Äôt real you just have to do, and the checklist all give me the push necessary to bettering me and my daily life. Honestly, can‚Äôt really find the words to describe it but try the free trial and see if it works for you. Personally, I used it once and didn‚Äôt really understand it, forgot to cancel my trial and here we are. Best accident to happen yet.

Overall a great app,2021-04-28 16:38:18,False,"I have recommended this app to multiple people as it has been a great way for me to track my progress and receive consistent accountability.

As far as feedback goes, I‚Äôve grown to strongly dislike the background music. I understand the healing and relaxation properties that music can have, but I find these specific tunes very annoying compared to meditative sounds I prefer. I have muted the sounds during the routines and also went to settings to turn them off. Unfortunately it comes back on no matter what I do. I also believe that celebrating overall progress would be nice. In addition to longest streaks, acknowledging consistent attempts will encourage people even more I believe. For instance, I have never completed an entire week of my routines, but there was one week I tried everyday, and there were only two days I couldn‚Äôt fully complete. I like to celebrate small wins, and that to me was one. Other than that I love what the Fabulous team is doing with the app. All I ask is that you either offer different selections of background music and/or allow a muting option that actually works please.",Netta Lynne,4,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

I have spent decades learning self care and reparenting myself, but in the very dark times, it can still be challenging to come out the other end. In this particular instance, I truly needed my hand held and guidance back to my light. Fabulous gave me this gift and so much more. When in a state of depression, something as simple as remembering to drink water or eat a good breakfast or move my body can feel like a mountain to climb. Fabulous‚Äô gentle daily reminders, along with lovely inspiring encouragement, made all of these small goals attainable again. If you‚Äôve struggled with depression, you know the impact such small feats can have.

I remembered how great Fabulous was at helping me keep up a solid routine, and so decided to download it again. Now that I'm past the ""drink water"" challenge once again, I'm really happy to spend a little on a subscription so I can fill up my ""rituals"" with all the things I wanna do!
The only reason I can't give it five stars is because I feel there are many places it could improve, such as the ability to add custom ""habits"", and the option to skip the ""drink water"" and ""eat breakfast"" challenges if you've already been doing that for however long (like me, hehe).
I also find it a little bit of an oxymoron that the app continuously tells you to get away from tech, yet says to make sure you use it as often as you possibly can, as well as follow all of their social, but I suppose that's just a part of running an app, haha.",Kae Sera,4,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

You don‚Äôt know what is next. Just accept that and trust your new coach, which is an app full of a ton of science-based content. The first thing you are told to do is start a morning routine of drinking a glass of water when you first wake up. If you already do this, then just check it off and be patient. If you must, start one of the challenges so you have something new to do, but try to start small. For the first few days of the trial I felt like the app was asking me to just totally trust it, even though it hadn‚Äôt given me a good enough reason. I also felt that 7 days was not long enough. But by day 5 I was feeling really good. I had set an alert on my phone to cancel if I didn‚Äôt want to start a paid subscription, but I decided that this is worth it.

The support from the positive community here and the inspiring little messages that come with goal completion give you that extra push to continue on the path you set up. I‚Äôve only been doing it for a week and albeit a slow start, I am beginning to really see some new habits form and I love it! Be the healthier, happier you that you know you can and want to be. It‚Äôs as simple as saying ‚ÄúI want to change‚Äù and you don‚Äôt have to do it alone. Having served 10 years in the military I recognize the importance of support in trying to develop yourself into your goals. Except instead of a DI yelling in your face to push through, you have a supportive community that provides the same support, but in a calm and motivating manner. Different tactics, similar results!

You get what you put in,2020-03-28 02:35:15,False,"This app is a great tool to help disorganized individuals get organized. Personally, I often find myself forgetting to do simple things because I am too caught up in thought. This app snaps me out of that so that I can remember other things I need to do. Furthermore, it has an incredible amount of great advice regarding a variety of subjects. This advice will make you both more efficient and effective in whatever you are setting out to accomplish. I greatly respect the way this app was designed.

Having said that, this app won‚Äôt cure you of laziness. You need to find a way to be intrinsically motivated to maintain habits. When you have cultivated that motivation, this app will serve as a way to hone that motivation. I don‚Äôt use it for work, as that is not something I need to be reminded of. However, I often forget to tidy up or make my bed. Even more, I forget to celebrate every little victory I have throughout the day, and to end the day with gratitude. These small tweaks in habit lead to enormous changes in wellbeing. 

For anyone who needs help (or even advice) with keeping their life organized, healthy, and productive, I highly recommend this app.",Diogenes the Optimist,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
"Disappointed, easy fix",2020-02-09 03:05:58,False,"This app seemed promising but turned out to be really unfortunate. I started with the 7 day free trial and after setting my intentions, I was given my first new habit. To drink water every morning. This is something I already do every day so I was eager to just move on to my next step. Unfortunately the app makes you complete the habit you‚Äôre on for 3 DAYS before giving you another. And you cannot preview what the next habit will be. So I stopped opening the app because it had nothing to tell me. I then realized that if the next habit was also something I already do, I would be forced out of the trial period and charged the yearly fee before I even got my third habit. I quickly cancelled the subscription.

This issue would be sooo easily fixed if when given a ‚Äúhabit‚Äù to begin you had the option to say ‚ÄúI already do this‚Äù so it could move on to something else. I searched everywhere in the app for an option to skip the task but if it exists I couldn‚Äôt find it. Developers, please add a skip option and this app would be so much more worthwhile. It‚Äôs almost like the app assumes you must not have any good habits when you begin.

I ended up in the hospital for a freak accident of internal bleeding, had emergency surgery, and was bedfast.

Instead it sends messages implying that everyone ‚Äúfalls of the bandwagon‚Äù - umm, that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here: thank you. It comes across as condescending and becomes a reminder of what you can‚Äôt do and all of the life you are missing out on because you are trying to recover. It‚Äôs completely demoralizing. This app absolutely needs a way to hit pause and take a step back when life (car wrecks, deaths, etc.) gets in the way of the less important ‚Äòfive minute walks, workout ritual, make sure you‚Äôre tidying your space, yoga rituals, and the like. Nobody cares about that crap when you‚Äôre in bed fighting for your life. The creators of the app did not think that through - life happens.

There are also journeys that you set up to help you with everyday problems. For example, social media detox, self-love, de-clutter, gratitude, being able to let go, journaling, etc. This app gives you a chance to reflect and change yourself for the better.

I‚Äôve seen people say that the app is inflexible in its goals, but most of the time you can work around the specifics and do something else in the same vein. I can‚Äôt drink a full glass of water first in the morning because of my acid reflux, but I can remember that it‚Äôs a goal of mine and drink 4-5 extra sips.

This is great therapy for those of us who can‚Äôt get access to behavioral therapy right now. I feel more refreshed when I go about my business in the morning because I have more habits to keep me moving. I feel rewarded just for drinking water. In principle, this app is amazing.

Not intuitive,2021-06-14 09:05:08,False,"I tried to set up this app for the free trial (7 days) but it made me start with only one habit that happened to already be something I do every day. And then because I don‚Äôt always look at my phone every morning and didn‚Äôt check off a day even when I did it, it set me back to day 1. So the one week trial was useless to see if I could build new habits.

Besides those issues, i found the animations to be rather annoying and pointless.

I found this app to be so incredibly empowering. I felt heard about things that many doctors and professionals had left me feeling uninspired and alone about.

I realized that no app can truly help you attain greatness, you must examine the situation yourself. Why? Because behind the app is a developer, and what does the developer need? Money, payment, dinero, dough, the big bucks. It seems ironic and comical that they are charging you an unreasonable price for something that should be available to every person on the face of this earth regardless of his/her paycheck; improving their lives and finding self induced-happiness. To keep it short I‚Äôm disappointed, but not surprised. I just ask that this app doesn‚Äôt FORCE the user to upgrade by taunting them with his/her future self.

Plus it‚Äôs got these cute stories, poems that are sort of like super quick mediation, and REALLY good animation. Plus it‚Äôs got a huge number of tips, gentle reminders, and inspirational messages to go along with the habits. So when it started telling me to eat breakfast every day (which you are technically allowed to delete if you‚Äôre super against breakfast I guess), it also started adding a daily tiny article about food, or breakfast ideas, or (my favorite) reminders to actually buy breakfast foods...

Great app so far!!,2020-05-27 02:35:55,False,"First off, to all the people complaining about the trials,

You don‚Äôt have to buy the subscription to use the app, there is an exit button at the top of the screen. Then after that the app explains that you need to start small. Then it has you drink water for three days. If you already do that just wait three days, but if your angry that it‚Äôs such a simple thing, read the app. You don‚Äôt need to rush into everything so fast! Taking it slow is nice sometimes.

Ok, now to the review! I downloaded this app about a half hour ago and love it! I like how it uses your name to make it seem more personalized. Apps that do that are really awesome because they grab your attention. I also like how easy it is to set up. I set it up in under a minute. I just had to answer a few questions and I was off! It gives you tips on how to achieve goals.

I also love how it takes it slow while still moving fast. Some apps have no introduction to self care at all and just tell you to set a goal. This app isn‚Äôt like that. It tells you a bit about the app and asks you a few questions, gives you a task and tells you why you should do it. It also doesn‚Äôt say, right you have the app now your on your own!

My favorite thing I‚Äôve noticed, is that the app did not recommend adding more goals within the first few days.

I‚Äôve tried a few other apps, and honestly, some of those I tried may work for other people. But I can say Fabulous is the only one that works for me.
Part of the reason I would lose motivation before was I thought too big at a time, and I had trouble getting started small without coaching. This app helps with that, by starting very small, and it coaches you along the way. It really is a personal feeling app.
It helps you introduce more and more little goals, building habits in steps and bringing them all together. Before you know it, you‚Äôve already made big changes. The community feeling of it makes it feel quite down to earth, and to me that makes it easier to stay motivated. When you know tons of other people are doing the same thing as you, you all help each other out, and everyone gets to where they want.
It really is amazing what you can do without ever paying anything. I might upgrade some day, but for now I‚Äôm real happy with Fabulous.

Best App for Creating a Schedule!,2020-08-29 00:44:56,False,"I bought the full version of the app due to the appeal and simplicity of use.

So, in the afternoon and evening (the morning is already set up within the app) I made a list of three to four things I could easily accomplish, and they wouldn‚Äôt take up a lot of time to do. The only thing I can‚Äôt figure out is how to add to the afternoon and evening lists if I want to.

The app also keeps you accountable as well. You HAVE to check off what you‚Äôve done in order to get credit for the day. I love that feature. It has a push feature to send you notifications throughout the day.

They say one of the best things to help with bipolar disorder is to set a firm routine and this app has helped me tremendously with that. I feel like I have accomplished something just by completing little daily tasks and keeping on schedule. It tells you to celebrate your little victories and this is a huge plus for me. Gratification has always been an issue of mine. I love it for that. 

The only things that I would amend would be something like a ‚Äúvacation mode‚Äù because when I am away or I have company I‚Äôm not always able to achieve each of my daily goals. This makes me feel like I haven‚Äôt done enough with my day. The inability to do that task sets me back.

The best part, if you don't compete a task, the app won't judge you which wag key because my habit since childhood was always to judge myself and then I'd feel bad or guilty for not completing the task.

I am finding the same thing is happening this time around. I have learned how to better use it the second time, but it is still disheartening when you know you have completed a part of a journey but it wasn't counted. and even what screen meant what and whaThis is my second time using it and I realized that the home screen is split between ‚Äúyour journey‚Äù and ‚Äúyour routines‚Äù and not just random information on the page, it could still be defined more.

The user experience is terrible. It‚Äôs INCREDIBLY confusing when you first start using the app and it‚Äôs difficult to want to use because it‚Äôs just so cluttered. 

You can only do one journey or goal at a time - which is totally fine - but it doesn‚Äôt really *show* you what it wants you to do at any given point in the journey. The app is also super intrusive ‚Äî if you go to check off an item or complete a task, it‚Äôll suddenly blast out sound with some cheesy letter (the voice acting/graphics are atrocious and make the whole thing feel cheap). At first, I was constantly silencing my phone or quickly closing out the app whenever I checked something off. It‚Äôs definitely not something you can effectively use without headphones in non-private spaces. 

But again, it‚Äôs just sooo confusing. You can see everything you can‚Äôt actually do yet (or shouldn‚Äôt - as it recommends), which clutters up the entire home screen and makes the things you‚Äôre actually using less accessible.

I was hoping for something a little more guided, a lot simpler, and a whole lot more focused. Each letter is like 3/4 of uninspired writing mixed with heaps of filler.  I‚Äôm really disappointed.",courtney 15,2,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

I would use it daily if the premium features were free but without premium you can barely do anything.

Poor Support / Cancellation & Reimbursement,2021-02-15 13:58:40,False,"I will start by admitting that I was under the misleading impression of how canceling my service worked.

Yes, they make the renewal dates and charges clear, I wasn‚Äôt confused about when and how much. I accept that I should have canceled yesterday, but to be so obvious w/ the lack of care of my mistake when you‚Äôre charging someone annually, not even just monthly, is absurd to me and telling of the value of the company. 

This is a self care app, it promotes a healthy well-being and one of the ways is through reducing stress. This charge is causing me so and it seems their support team doesn‚Äôt care and have no intentions to help. It seems very hypocritical given the purpose of the app they run.

My experience w/ the app itself wasn‚Äôt even satisfying enough for me to consider keeping the subscription so I‚Äôm basically out of money and stuck w/ a service I don‚Äôt want and again, they do not care.

Fabulous is different.

The app provides opportunities to reflect on your feelings at critical moments during the day, to really maximize your commitment to continuing on to your goals.
Not only that, they‚Äôve managed to personalize the experience in such a way that it feels tailored to YOUR own individual needs. 
I‚Äôm already eagerly integrating healthier choices into my routine that just a month ago felt like torture.

Regardless of cancelling, if you leave your card on file they will still charge you after the fact, even if you have already cancelled. If this is an app you plan on not using after a brief period of time, I highly recommend looking elsewhere as this app is very scummy when it comes to payment and charging you.

This is the most well-built app I've ever used. The creators clearly know their stuff and everything in it is useful and simple.

 Some suggestions for this app:
1. One time goals - Allow us to set one time goals too instead of habits that we do every day. Maybe let us tap on a day on the calendar to set our separate goals.
2. More exercises in Make Me Fabulous - There are only 3 exercises except 1-Min ""Just Get Moving!"" and Sphere Running exercises. We need more!
3. Let us set time for individual habits - Setting time for individual habits will help us do them before it's too late... Happened to me couple of times when I decided I'd do most of my habits together later in the day but was too tired to complete them.

‚Ä¢ Setting am alarm for each habit would be amazing. I know you can do it in your regular alarm app, but having it in fabulous stitched to their system which can also be customized will be amazing.
‚Ä¢ Keep on with the animated letters. So before this , a letter used to come and I would ignore it. But this time it has animations just in case you need pretty visuals. Keep on with that. It is working amazingly for me.
The only con I am seeing so far for this app is that the layout is very messy. Like you have the progress bar which tracks your progress but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it is part of that (like it doesn‚Äôt need to be there and is like an extra). And the pathway I am talking about is like the Day one day two thing with the fabulous spirit floating around each day as you finish a habit. It is not needed tbh. Remove that and keep the one which just tracks your one new helps for three days.

However, most of what I like about the app disappeared with the update. It wasn‚Äôt as inspirational or encouraging as before.

I thought the ‚Äúgift pass‚Äù was a really sweet idea too, until I sent it to a few people and it turns out it‚Äôs another marketing scheme. Please don't call it a gift to pass on to others if the gift receiver is obliged to enter credit card details.

That aside, the free version is pretty handy! There are plenty of practical prompts to help build yourself a healthier routine and the design is pleasant to look at and navigate.

Surprisingly meaningful,2020-07-27 01:45:45,False,"This app, while very unusual, has probably been the most meaningful one I‚Äôve ever been downloaded/purchased, as it‚Äôs been a big source of foundational habits. 

I used to drink 5 Diet Cokes and a coffee a day. Now I mostly just drink ice water, and no caffeine. For the last few years, I‚Äôve make a to do list most days in a notebook, and I prioritize it quickly and identify the three things I really want to get done. When I‚Äôm stressed, I now do some sort of meditation and I find I can focus better. 

All these are things I learned to do seriously in this app. Lately, for really the first time, I‚Äôve started a regular exercise program. It really feels like it may be something I keep up with, unlike my many earlier attempts. 

There are plenty of goofy/questionable suggestions, some journeys (healthy eating?) that just don‚Äôt seem terribly effective, some other ones that just won‚Äôt end, and about a billion references to Teddy Roosevelt for some reason.

While trying to use the app I‚Äôm just overwhelmed with constant random substance-less features and it becomes difficult to even do basic navigation and get back to where you just were in the app, there‚Äôs no clear direction,  constant pop up style interactions and animations clutter and confuse. 
It‚Äôs a shame that distracting, messy, unclear design was chosen over functionality (exactly what people who need this app need). 

It also asked me what I want to stop using in the questionnaire, social media was one of only 2 options so I picked that, anything I do on this app it asks me to share on social media. I downloaded this app to improve myself, Im not interested in giving you free advertising, and that shouldn‚Äôt be on the table anyway for a user that has flagged social media as a trouble area.

Perhaps worst of all is that It has faux science, for example, it based a bad habit section on astrology, apparently I drink too much coffee since I‚Äôm a Gemini. I‚Äôm serious this was in the app, very very very disappointing for a ‚Äòscience based‚Äô app

One of the most confusing parts for me is that I have no idea that what will happen next after clicking on something. Sometimes you could end up getting 2 or 3 more new action items within that! Im honestly scared to click on anything...

My main issue is that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to track things weekly or monthly.

I think that naturally lends itself to building habits that may happen with a longer time frame.
Eg. Pay bills on time, go out with friends X times per month, go to the gym 3 times per week.

I would definitely pay for this app if it had that option. And it seems like a much easier thing to implement than some of the current features.

Actually using the app entails closing out of or reading through tons of ""motivational"" popups and weird letters of encouragement. These might be nice if they didn't appear right when you were trying to fill your check list. Make them an optional little side notification to explore, not a requirement to use the app.

You can't add more than 4 habits to your list unless you pay for premium.

You cant go back to the morning/afternoon if you forget to check off the habit then (even though you did it) which then messes up your progress through the app (which allows you to unlock extra habits and features) 

There doesn't seem to be a cohesive place to look at progress in a meaningful way, instead there are ""chapters"" that are nature themed and reminiscent of candy crush levels.

It creates false storylines and posts complicated moving graphics on every page of the app. For someone with ADD, it's visually overstimulating, and it distracts me from forming my own neurological links and memories surrounding my own life story.  Visually lovely, but not useful for quick and decisive action.

The app also notified me daily about tasks that I had already completed and checked off, which undermines the sense of accomplishment.  Disappointing and frustrating.  üòï",NicknamesAllTook,2,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

The only thing that‚Äôs a bit frustrating is how often you‚Äôre prompted to ‚Äúshare via [instagram, text,... etc.]. I did this as more of a personal goal for me, not as a way to share with the world. I want to be able to save the fun daily images, not have them be shared in order to save.

I love the idea behind this app, and it‚Äôs beautifully designed, but as a guy, it‚Äôs distracting to see the graphics constantly showing me as a young girl. Why even bother asking our gender in the first place?

Pros: 
- It starts you out with easy to attain goals
- There‚Äôs a social aspect (though the post I submitted was lost and there‚Äôs no where to view your own posts)
- let‚Äôs you customize your routines (can‚Äôt seem to delete the one you want though, at least for me. Submitted this to support and waiting for a response still)
- a lot of variety to choose from for adding to your routines
- comes with challenges (like cutting sugar, alcohol and even live challenges that let you participate with others)
- not toxic positivity 

Cons:
- There‚Äôs a social aspect 
- the reminders could be more ‚Äúpushy‚Äù 
- support is lackluster
- the price is pretty high and in my trial so far I‚Äôve yet to see the $50/year value (but I still have a few days left)

Secondly, the app keeps you from doing most things until you have read a lesson and answered a question about whether you agree. They also play cute videos at the end to tell you about your journey.

The app claims to be developed by/with a behavior economist - as a behavior analyst I find it lacking.  I think it‚Äôs intrusive with very little positive reinforcement.

It‚Äôs frustrating because you cannot edit the past days when the software does that kind of mistakes.

I contacted support a couple of time about it and it took forever for them to give me a half baked answer. I don‚Äôt think they care about that issue.

I wish there was a journal tab that I can click on and it would pull up all my entries from previous days (with the topics/area you were working on) 

The second, I wish there was a save or favoriting sections for articles, reading things of the activities. These only appear at the time you click on the new habit/ exercise and once you click complete they are gone.

Great concept horrible design,2020-04-18 13:09:04,False,The graphics are unnecessarily and overwhelming. It feels like it‚Äôs developed for a high schooler not adult.

I am also one who keeps everything bottled up to make sure everyone is happy. In honesty, this is my second day using the app and in my opinion it‚Äôs already starting to ease my mind and I feel relaxed for once. IConstantly think about death (not suicide but just the feeling after) or everything else around me.

Unexpectedly surprised,2020-05-20 07:51:39,False,"I‚Äôm really enjoying the app. Honestly I had very low expectations terms of its ability to improve my life and how I feel. And I definitely didn‚Äôt think it would actually impact my day to day habits. I‚Äôve been suffering from extreme  burnout, and have tried a variety of approaches to mitigate the effect on my professional and personal life, including taking vacation without much change. Somehow since using this app, I‚Äôm now going on my third week, I have actually been feeling a little more positive, energized and motivated to work every day. This app has helped me design a routine and stick to it. Who knew that was possible. I magically seem to remember to do the habits because of their methodology. Furthermore the structure prioritizes my personal needs at the time of starting the program which was my own health and some other parts of life that are important to me but are often neglected and end up on the bottom of my to do list. It‚Äôs a bit surreal to think that since I began using this app, my work responsibilities and life balance has become more manageable and consistent but it absolutely has. It definitely didn‚Äôt happen over night and was impatient to see results immediately the first week, but after week two there has been considerable decrease in burnout symptoms and I look forward to completing the morning and afternoon routines so that I can mark them complete in the app. I was very skeptical and part of me would have thought the improvements were just placebo, but it‚Äôs really not. And at this point there haven‚Äôt been any other changes in my life much less anything that would create a positive sustainable difference in my day to day life other than the Fabulous app. Because the improvements began to occur when I began using the app and has continued to progress slowly (but with patience) since then.

The best habit tracker,2020-04-02 15:15:25,False,"I‚Äôve never been so impressed with what an app could accomplish in my life. It‚Äôs too underrated and should get more love... this is the best thing that‚Äôs happened to me in quarantine! First of all, unlike other apps which only let you pick 3 or 5 habits, this lets you pick a total of 9, spread out into morning, afternoon, and evening routines. They limit you to three for each ritual at first to keep you motivated but later they‚Äôll slowly add more for you as you continue on your journey. I even sent feedback only for a misunderstanding in the app, but the answer I received was thoroughly written. I could tell that they actually cared about my experience, so thanks for that! Fabulous is also (fabulous) at making my habits stick. When I used Productive, it gave me no motivators whatsoever so I was forced to push myself. But I‚Äôm lazy...so I couldn‚Äôt really do that, and I ended up just not completing any of my habits and discouraging myself. Fabulous has what they call a Fabulous Moment, where it pushes you to do everything at once. Having a timer for each habit is also very helpful. They even send you letters from your ‚Äúfuture self‚Äù and so on to motivate you even further. The Coaching tab was so much more detailed than I thought it would be! And best of all, you don‚Äôt have to pay for any of the features I mentioned! They offer pretty nice stuff in Premium, however. One thing I would suggest is to make it an option to view the days of the week on the home screen so you can tap them and check off which ones you completed if you forgot to on that day. Productive had this option, but this is just a suggestion to make this app even more efficient!

Pretty good,2021-01-05 17:35:33,False,"I feel there are many things this app can help with. Especially in the new year resolution area. Mine was to be more aware of what I wasn‚Äôt taking advantage of and setting routines for a better, more productive life. I always say I will take care of something, or I need to work out, or I wish I could have more time for me. This app, so far, is starting slowly to get me into that mindset of setting a routine daily. Now, there are some quirks to the app as how fast it may be taking you, and it really depends on your life, when you get up, and what your schedule looks like daily. This is more driven for people working the 9-5 jobs, whereas I work 6-3. I really hope this works to help me in my continued growth, and I‚Äôm learning slowly to change my life for the best one yet. 

I understand what they are aiming to do with the app, just wish it would stretch the challenges a little farther, instead of 3 days and a new routine, maybe every 5-7 days so I can get used to the idea of say, drinking water every morning. I like taking it slow, getting used to the idea, manipulating it and being excited about it, but within 7 days I‚Äôve got 4 things they want me to be doing before going into work! Plus, maybe I‚Äôm not seeing all of the options, but I wish I could opt out of a challenge or snooze it for just a few days, let me get my head wrapped around the idea of my new routine, then I can progress with my journey. I have purchased the premium membership, I plan on using this to help me with my routines and mindsets, and I am committed to using the app. So just little things I‚Äôve seen after the 7 initial days.

Overall, I believe in the end this will help me, but I do see where some won‚Äôt benefit and see it as more a burden daily. It‚Äôs a daily app that wants you to be committed, so if you‚Äôre not fully ready for a change, don‚Äôt purchase the premium, but definitely try the app out! They give you 7 day free trial, and with that it seems like the best app I‚Äôve seen to help with self improvement. To a better 2021!",amos8086,4,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Customer service - NOT,2021-06-08 13:55:10,False,"I've used Fabulous for years and absolutely love it... when it works, but customer support seems non-existent when it doesn't. On the one hand, it has worked for me most of the time, but it recently broke when I migrated to a new phone. Short version of the break - As long as I stay on my current journey I'm fine, but when I try to switch to a new challenge it requires me to sign in to my account (which I'm already signed into) and then it freezes. This is in spite of having followed the instructions for switching to a new device. I get that things happen, but the only option for customer support is an email in the app and responses are extremely slow, if you even get a response. I know because this is the third time I've contacted support. The first time they took weeks before getting back to me and the second request was a simple question that I sent them four days ago and haven't heard back. So, I'm not surprised I haven't heard from them in 24 hours about the break, but I am more frustrated this time because this issue prevents me from fully using the app. I will add that when I asked on the app's FB page the simple question about what time of day daily coaching was posted, my post was disapproved, within just a few hours, the moderator told me it was inappropriate for the FB group's purpose, and I was directed to use the help function in the app, which of course has received no response.

I like the quotes much better where I can journal my thoughts alongside it. I also really like the guides and other suggestions that pop up that I can even quickly post on Instagram or save in my phone. However, I am currently having a hard time even locating them at the moment. I could have sworn yesterday there was a way for me to go back to them. I would prefer prompts that keep me more interested and then have a place to go back to and access them again or a place where I can better see my daily progress outside of just the journey prompt with the habits. I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôll keep the subscription after the 7 day trial. It‚Äôs a nice app and I do like being forced to slow down and ease into the goals since I‚Äôm often overloading myself with goals, but I don‚Äôt feel that challenged. You can‚Äôt build on a challenge and keep the habit, but maybe that‚Äôs the point that I‚Äôm not fully grasping. I‚Äôm not fully bought in because it hasn‚Äôt fully peaked my interest. It would be nice if the app maybe asked a series of questions and tried to learn a little more about you before it forced you into a specific set of habits to follow that may not apply to you.

"A Fabulous, Happy Mistake",2020-06-28 03:26:35,False,"I downloaded this app for the free trial, liked it and used it for a day or two. Then on the third day completely forgot about it. Well, as most of us do, I forgot to cancel my trial and ended up purchasing a year‚Äôs subscription. There‚Äôs a lot I want to improve in my life and it did seem to work for me... so I made the decision to just use it for a year. A couple of weeks after that, while trying to attempt exercising semi-regularly, I remembered this app. Then I said to myself, ‚ÄúI paid for it and I‚Äôm for damned sure gonna use it.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs how I started my new life. I set my goals in Fabulous for three times of my day. Then, even when I didn‚Äôt want to do any of the routines I had set for myself, I would use the app everyday anyway. By reminding myself that I paid for it and was going to get my money‚Äôs worth. 

Though honestly, Fabulous makes you want to login three times a day anyway. It can make different tasks so much more pleasant with the ‚ÄúLaunch Fabulous Moment‚Äù feature that will time out for you when you‚Äôve programmed it to, plays instrumental music, shows appealing images, shows how many days you‚Äôve done this task, and has a pleasant sound that becomes rewarding when the timer let‚Äôs you know you‚Äôre done. Then it‚Äôs motivational challenges, motivational stories, and motivational ‚Äúletters‚Äù are actually helpful, actually motivational, aren‚Äôt cheesy, and are relatable (and pretty). 

This is the Fabulous Happy Mistake I‚Äôve fallen into, and I am beyond grateful for it. Best ‚Äúmistake‚Äù ever. This is a system that works for me and makes me look forward to using it. Plus it also includes some directionals too. 

Download this app, seriously, if it worked for me of all people, it‚Äôll work for you. Change your life and make a Fabulous, Happy Mistake too. You won‚Äôt regret it.",Scammed by Apple,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

A little push out of deep depression - some changes needed,2020-07-30 18:51:35,False,"I have had a terrible depression for 6 months. I recently started to see a therapist who recommended I start a small routine in the morning and set a positive intention. I stumbled on this app looking for a technical source to aid me in making small changes. This app has been wonderful on answering what I needed which is what should I do first when setting my small routine and what steps should I take.  I‚Äôm a week in and have a morning, afternoon, night routine - with only 2-3 steps for each. I have accomplished each one which is saying a lot from someone who couldn‚Äôt do anything for myself for months. The guided goals on lowering my tech addiction, and focusing on my physical health are really helpful. I have previously tried to do routines but made them too detailed and got discouraged when I could not complete them.

The few things I would like to change about the app:
I received a on screen alert from ‚Äúme‚Äù ten years from now that said they were still the same and I need to keep making changes I am making now for that not to happen. This was extremely discouraging and this fear and helplessness of being the same is a primary driver of my depression. I don‚Äôt think fear-based alerts is a good idea and would plead with you to remove that alert!

The music box sound that plays as an alarm for your routines is high pitched and grating - I would like the option to change the alarm.

The constant ‚Äúshare‚Äù alerts that have me sending the fab app to my friends is weird and intrusive. Maybe have that less in the app - I understand why it‚Äôs there - it just shows up too often.",Fwuzzfwuzz,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

"Seems effective so far, very cute",2020-08-20 12:57:24,False,"I‚Äôm the kind of person who fully jumps into a new routine and then gets overwhelmed and quite a few days later. Apps don‚Äôt help because they overwhelm me almost immediately. I‚Äôm liking Fabulous so far, though, because it‚Äôs making me go kind of slow. I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed. On the contrary, I have been achieving the few small tasks every day since getting the app, and have been slowly adding on more instead of trying to do everything at once. This feels achievable. 

I am also engaged by the storytelling aspect of this app, and the graphics. It‚Äôs just really cute and well designed. I‚Äôm an illustrator and graphic designer, myself, so the visuals and ease of use of any app really stand out to me. A few things were a little difficult to understand at first, but I got the hang of them after a couple of days. The app leads me, but also gives me enough wiggle room to make my own decisions about the paths I take on it.

My one negative would be that it keeps encouraging me to connect with others on the app. I know that seems like a silly critique, and it is true for many people that connecting with others helps them achieve their goals! But for me I usually find it to be the opposite. I get overwhelmed with the social aspects and feel like I‚Äôm failing, rather than feeling encouraged. Also, as soon as someone is negative or whiny in a forum, I don‚Äôt want to be there any more, so the social media, forum, online connection aspect of any app really sets me back rather than encouraging me. I just wish that I could turn those ‚Äúreminders‚Äù off. 

But it is a very good app and I am hopeful that it will help me achieve goals I‚Äôve heretofore been unable to stick with. I‚Äôll update this review if that changes, but here‚Äôs hoping I won‚Äôt have to!",booksnake,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Truly Amazing!!,2021-04-11 12:00:54,False,"This game is absolutely amazing. I would recommend for all ages. Although paid version offers good stuff, can use perfectly well without paying anything.

Features:

1. Daily goals:

Fabulous offers daily goals in the best way possible. Not only are the beautiful artistic drawings customized to each routine, but there is tranquil and calming music playing through each. Once a routine is done, you hit a check mark and it moves to the next until you finish.

2. Fabulous moment:

This app offers a really cool feature called a fabulous moment. It runs you through the daily goals and then plays a tidbit of a story (totally optional) and let‚Äôs you see a bit more each day. This is great motivation to come back and really fun.

3. Letters:

Fabulous sends you letters of encouragement and even letters from your future self (if you enable them) which I personally love.

4. Fabulous community:

Though I personally opted out of joining the fabulous community (parents if you don‚Äôt want your kids to have social media you can use the app completely social media free) just to distance myself from social media, but it really is a great community. If you want to talk about issues or find a wholesome community of people with similar experiences, this app is for you.

"If you are like me, try this app.",2020-10-05 21:09:46,False,"Hi, I am a 16 year old girl. I am considered obese and I suffer from PCOS, hypothyroidism, extreme anxiety, extreme depression, ADD and a few other cherries on top. I want to treat myself better physically and mentally.

I started browsing through the App Store and found apps that claimed to ‚Äúhelp become a better you‚Äù. I gave each app a little more then a week. But it was all the same. Nothing was truly organized, everything was hugged into one category with out thinking about the one using the app. Every app I tried just didn‚Äôt help or keep me motivated. I can‚Äôt forget that on certain apps it makes you pay for the content you want most.

 I was feeling worse cause nothing was working! Then I found this app. I didn‚Äôt think it would work or help me but I tried it. Oh boy did I think wrong. This is the by far the best app I have ever tried. It takes things slow and guides you through each day. 

It started out with questions about myself and I answered to my best ability. Then I was greeted with an animation which is so well put together and beautiful. My first task was to start with drinking water in the morning for 3 days straight. I failed the second day and tried again. This app gives tips on how to do tasks without forgetting. Like setting a glass of water beside the bed before sleeping. I‚Äôve only had this app for about a week or so. I know this app has good intentions and will help me be a better me. I‚Äôm done being tired and feeling so little about myself. I think if you are anything like me, you need to try this app. 

I just want to thank those who created this app. I have never felt so good about myself before. I might of just started but I am so excited to have found you guys. I thought I had lost the battle for a healthy me. I even tried at home stuff but it just didn‚Äôt work. This app is well thought, put together and I just know that those who created and work on it put so much care into it. I wish I would of found this app sooner. Seriously, thank you so much. It feels almost way to true to have this app. I never ever leave reviews but... people need to know that this is truest one of the best apps to get. Thank you thank you thank you!

Beautiful App,2021-03-17 14:40:15,False,"To the creators of this app, thank you. You‚Äôve already helped me so much when I didn‚Äôt think I could be helped at this point. 

I‚Äôve been really struggling lately with my mental health and focus due to several factors including a breakup, debt with no job, and being kicked out of school (attendance issues, also due to deteriorating mental health). It‚Äôs gotten so bad that my suicidal thoughts have come back for the first time since I was 16 (I am currently a 20y old woman), and my mom has urged me to seek out therapy and medication for the first time in my life because I‚Äôm worrying my family so much. I‚Äôve been isolating to an extreme degree, losing an unhealthy amount of weight due to not eating, and crying at uncontrollable intervals.
Then I found this app, and about 6 days in, I have HOPE. I feel like I am actually capable of taking control and making a change. It starts slow enough that if you‚Äôre already struggling with the small tasks, you won‚Äôt feel overwhelmed. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and there‚Äôs a ‚Äúzen mode‚Äù for completing your daily tasks that I like to use  as a meditative state which leaves me feeling a little lighter after (not much, a realistic amount, meditation isn‚Äôt a miracle worker). The app could be organised a little better, I was able to find my way around the app easily but for those that aren‚Äôt as savvy with technology it would probably be a little confusing. 
And no, I was not paid to review this, I actually came into the app store by my own will to write this. I wish this was a paid review. I could really do with some cash haha. 
I wish I could give this app more praise. More than 5 stars. I‚Äôm considering purchasing the lifetime subscription which is like $200 something, when I get the money for it. That‚Äôs how much I think this app is worth it.",shesbellacole,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
Watch out! They will try to catch you off guard,2021-04-14 16:40:23,False,"So this app, depending on where or how you download it will come with either a 7 day, 30 day or even a 90 day free trial and then will charge you $40 for the year even if you will never use it if you find out it‚Äôs not for you. They do NOT send any kind of reminder of upcoming charge email likely looking to catch people not into the app off guard. (I‚Äôve checked and checked and there‚Äôs not even a confirmation of payment email even a week later. Had to find out via my monthly budgeting) Their messages eventually give a cold ‚Äúit was on your original agreement‚Äù so sorry about your bad luck. They do not answer any emails asking for refunds manually. You never speak to a real person. You get sent to a type-form survey that will only give you a refund it seems if you have just been charged within 48 hours (maybe) even if you missed it or if they could easily check to see if you ever even used the app. It would seem that good people created this app until you see how little they care about those who tried it but it didn‚Äôt work for them. Seems weird to make getting a refund so difficult and alerting your subscribers they‚Äôre about to be charged so nonexistent. If you do try this app pay close attention to which trial you signed up for.  I thought mine was 90 days since that was the trial they allowed me to share with friends but I was wrong. It was 30 days and now I‚Äôm stuck with an app that I will not use again because they send no reminder and no confirmation of payment email. Not even a partial refund for time spent. Just a full year charge and the icky taste of underhanded business practices in my mouth. Ugh.",Momof2MessiGirls,1,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

So much more than a habit app!,2021-04-18 17:27:41,False,"First of all, the fabulous app is based on research, which I love. 
It has structured ‚Äújourneys‚Äù that guide you to establish habits progressively at a pace that won‚Äôt overwhelm you and cause you to give up. The habits build on each other such that establishing the one habit increases your likelihood of following through with the next habit.
Habits are grouped into ‚Äúroutines‚Äù. The morning routine helps me get out of bed and have a good productive day. The evening routine helps me wind down and sleep well. You can add more routines like afternoon, work, etc. And you can add custom habits to any routine. You can also add reminders. 
Like other habit apps, the fabulous app tracks your progress. You can look at your streak to motivate you to keep going. 
The fabulous app also gives you the tools you need for many habits. There are guided workouts, guided meditation, timers similar to the pomodoro method to study/work, bedtime stories and music to drift into sleep, and many other tools so that you can complete the habits without switching to another app. 
Also, there are optional challenges and groups you can join to get motivated by other people with the same goals. 
Overall, an amazing app that helps me everyday. I have tried many other apps to track my habits but this is the only app that guides me to do it at a pace and order that will help me succeed. My mental and physical health have significantly improved thanks to this app. 
After the free trial, you can continue to use the app for free with limited capabilities. I do think the paid version is worth the cost. It is $40 per year and you definitely get a lot out of it.

"Stunning, beautiful, It‚Äôs perfect!",2020-11-07 19:33:18,False,"First time I‚Äôve written a review on my own accord and will. 5 stars. Would rate 6 stars if I could. Guys, if you are looking for an app to keep you on track with even the most basic of daily activities (making the bed, brush teeth, drink water) 

To more complex and in depth activities (‚Äúobserve the world and be present in the moment‚Äù, golden triangle, practice self love‚Äù)

There is a ‚Äòmake me fabulous‚Äô section in the home page, where you are presented with 12 activities (none requiring purchase) such as exercise, meditate, yoga, bedtime stories, breathing, sitting and thinking deeply, stretching. 
It is done really well. Like, really well designed and highly generous in content! 

The first set of journeys, 16 of them, take weeks to accomplish each one. This is tailored to what you select in the beginning survey on your behavior and things you would like to work on. Well done and very nicely paced! 

This app is 100% ad free. Visually stunning and non-cluttered. There is no pressure to purchase a subscription, and the option is only visible from settings. So it‚Äôs not in your face, like other apps. The subscription allows you to have a little bit more customization, and more journeys. You do not need the subscription to use the app to its full potential! Which makes it very generous and caring in design.

Final thoughts, great job. You have created something that brought happy tears to my eyes when I started using it, I felt actually cared for, through its AI- learning system based on your individual behaviors and goals. 

If I could suggest one thing, it would be to add a short journal section to each day. This could be toggle-able, so you don‚Äôt have to see it if you don‚Äôt want to. The journal could provide some prompts to help you get started, like gratitude and  personal success. Then the entries could be viewed day by day via the calendar. 

Love you all, have a wonderful, fantastic day!!!",Reviews111111111111,5,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

The Good and the Bad,2020-02-10 08:55:07,False,"I first installed this app because it was promoted by the App Store. I‚Äôm a skeptical person so I did not accept the trial. I used the app without it. After a while I accepted the trial and cancelled during the period. I had backed up my progress and did everything available to the subscribed user. I knew there was no way I‚Äôd pay $50 for a yearly app subscription - until I did. 

I‚Äôm someone who gives lots of support to others craves support in return. I rarely ever get it. As pathetic as it sounds, this is what this app does for me. It reminds me and encourages me. I realize that the processes used aren‚Äôt new and it‚Äôs things I‚Äôve read in books, articles and such but that‚Äôs the whole point - getting tried and true methods at my fingertips. 

When I re-downloaded the app I really had to work to figure out how to restore my data. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs difficult, I just could not figure out where to look! Now that I‚Äôve found it, it almost feels like a no brainer. Restoring my progress failed many times but I‚Äôm tenacious and kept at it. 

There have been many blank letters which I kept closing the app to try restoring, however that never worked. I ended up selecting that checkbox so I can move forward. 

Every bit of progress I make with this app makes me feel like I‚Äôm winning. I‚Äôm a perfectionist so it is rather difficult for me to feel this way.

Fabulous to me is that unwavering friend and personal assistant who is pushing me to be better. Of course I have many days that I ignore her, but she‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôve started drinking water and working out three times a week.",_Mystique_,4,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Okay so far,2021-06-12 18:47:26,False,"The Daily Coaching is excellent. The Habits/Routines building is also pretty good. The UI takes some getting used to. For example, the first thing in the Morning Routine is ‚Äúdrink water‚Äù but the things at the top of your Home Screen are a journal prompt and Daily Coaching. So it seems out of order. 

The Circles feature is a good idea poorly executed. Each Circle is a topic area with F*ceb**k style posts, but you get no notifications if anyone replies to your post and good luck finding your post again because only recent posts are displayed. And once you‚Äôve scrolled down to the bottom and not found your post, there‚Äôs no way to pop back to the top of the feed; you‚Äôre gonna scroll scroll scroll aaaaaall the way back up. I‚Äôm not sure how Circles is supposed to foster conversation when it‚Äôs so hard to use. You don‚Äôt even get notified if people like your post, so how are you supposed to draw encouragement if you don‚Äôt know who ‚Äúlikes‚Äù you?

There‚Äôs so much going on in this app it‚Äôs easy to get confused. For example, there‚Äôs a Challenges section, but you can‚Äôt do a Journey and a Challenge at the same time, and you‚Äôre placed in a Journey when you start using the app‚Äîso why doesn‚Äôt the app hide Challenges until you‚Äôve finished your first Journey? The app will say in one place }go slow and add one Habit and one Routine at a time,‚Äù but then in another place it presents a smorgasbord of options. Feed me one thing at a time or everything at once, but be consistent.

I‚Äôm still hoping this app will help me get my shtuff together, but so far it‚Äôs going about as well as every other life improvement app I‚Äôve ever tried, which is to say, good but not great.

"Buggy, incohesive app with Pushy Ads for Premium",2021-02-01 22:44:10,False,"This app is great when it works for its Journeys. It it slow to get from one screen to the next when you check off that you've done something as it goes through 1-4 scenes of graphics to congratulate you depending on what all you've finished.

There are a few times throughout the day that what I click on doesn't respond on the main Routine page. I need to re-open the app to get it to work again. Going to a different page and back to Routine does not work.

There are a mysterious 6 ""notifications"" that appear once in a while through my two weeks of use. I contacted support about it and they said it's ""due to a feature they're testing."" ....that seems kinda yikes to ""test"" something on production for that long and not take it down to bug fix.

Anyways. Being a free user is a joke for Journeys. ALL of the Second Mountain Journeys are locked behind Premium. One out of the two Third Mountain is also. This renders the main goal of the building blocks of this app a Premium Only feature.

The app also offers a 30-day pass to Premium Subscription but only through browser. Not the app. It is difficult to navigate cancelling it because of how it's set up. Very predatory ON TOP of the constant in-app ad push for Premium.

Fabulous Moments (semi-guided activities for when you want to do....well anything) are great. There is a short <10min one I liked to use called Blast Off for getting a jumpstart onto tasks. Even something as small content as that is locked to premium. Can't use it anymore after my trial was over.

Aside from these, content outside of Journeys is pretty busy.  Journeys carefully limit you from over extending yourself with Too Many Tasks, however these other sections feel like FOMO breeding grounds for all the things you COULD do that you can get added to your Routine list with your Journeys. Very counterintuitive for these to exist in the same space as a ""building blocks are the key to success"" type of approach.  I can see how these can (and honestly? Should.) be limited to Premium users. It's too much for a new user who doesn't really know exactly what they can learn from the app just yet. 

Anyways. I feel gross finding out I can't even do a Second Mountain, like not even one of them, on Free. It feels like they were just chaining users like me along just to either get Premium or dump the app. Like I'm not mad at the price. It seems reasonable for a well designed app (fix the UI bugs and then it'll actually be worth). The way in which they've fished me along to try to extract it from me by wasting my energy is disgusting, really.

Eh,2020-09-15 05:18:59,False,"This app has good intentions, and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfairly priced for what it offers. But i have some problems with it. 

1) It‚Äôs not anxiety friendly. The whole point is to reduce anxiety and stress, and set a goal right? But the app itself is loud and colorful, which some may like, but for instance: the increasing pitch of the dings between answering questions at the beginning? stressful and anxiety inducing. Little things like that nearly turned me away before starting the free trial. 

2) The set up, aesthetically, was nice (as well as the art, i loved the style). But functionally, while I didn‚Äôt encounter any bugs, the app was difficult and a little confusing to maneuver. I had some trouble understanding which day I was on? Or which day it was for each task, as I didn‚Äôt see a tally or checking system for each task. The homescreen just felt a bit cluttered to me. 

3) A bit biased, you guys were rude to my boyfriend who suffers anxiety and is also diagnosed with autism. I recommended this app because I thought it could help him, he got the trial, it didn‚Äôt work out, but he had forgotten about the free trial and was charged $40 for the membership. When he contacted you guys, saying he hadn‚Äôt meant to subscribe, you wouldn‚Äôt give him a refund, saying it was his fault. That‚Äôs not okay at all. All you did was stress him out even more, when the whole point of your app is to be a stress reliever, and to help out your customer. Well he didn‚Äôt like the app, it wasn‚Äôt right for him, he didn‚Äôt mean to do the membership, and you basically told him ‚Äútough luck‚Äù. Not cool at all. Give him his refund. 

Conclusion: Even though the art is aesthetically pleasing, and the app itself seems very inviting; I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app for anyone with high anxiety or stress. It could be good if you‚Äôre generally neurotypical, and/or can handle sudden or loud noises and bright distracting color palettes. But if you‚Äôre on the spectrum at all, I‚Äôd say to proceed with caution and use at your own comfort.",gurnhechtodtead,3,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Annoying features,2020-02-07 17:16:31,False,"Update: 
I paid for the subscription for a year. I‚Äôm really disappointed. The pop up after completing a task is so intrusive. Then they prompt you to share. It‚Äôs like they are trying to force a paid subscriber to advertise for them. There is no way to turn off the setting. I finally deleted the app and found one that didn‚Äôt force me to sit through a pointless pop up. I was going to the point to where I didn‚Äôt want to use the app. At times it would show a badge but have nothing to show me. Just all around intrusive. Customer service was of not help. They acted like they had no idea what I was talking about with the animation pop up screen after completing a task. 
It‚Äôs a great interface but not worth the hassle. Let users complete and move on or at least have the option to remove that feature. 

~~~~~~~~
I love this app it‚Äôs really terrific except a few things. When you complete something the app pops up with this thing for you to share and there‚Äôs no way to stop this from happening. Then it will remind you about completing your circles. Sometimes I get a badge on the app for no reason. Can‚Äôt figure out what the reason is and sometimes it stays for days. Customer service is only half helpful. I‚Äôve contacted them twice now and neither tome did I get really good help. No solution to my issues except things I told them I already tried.

THIS APP SCARRED ME,2021-04-21 20:39:03,False,"So I downloaded this app after seeing an ad on Tik-Tok. It seemed like a great concept, I figured it could help me keep up with healthy habits and routines. Once I downloaded the first thing I decided to try was the morning routine, where my challenge was to drink water first thing when I woke up. It would‚Äôve been more motivating if it had said a certain amount of water. I appreciate starting small but I could literally take one sip of water and check off the box for completing that task for the day. It wasn‚Äôt very gratifying and didn‚Äôt feel like an accomplishment. The second part of the routine was doing a one minute breathing exercise. I expected it the exercise to just pop up after that prompt but it didn‚Äôt. I had to search through the app for a breathing routine and the shortest one was 5 minutes. All of that is allot for me when I‚Äôm half awake. So I do the routine and while the narrator‚Äôs voice was nice she was talking so fast it actually gave me anxiety instead of relaxing me. I could barely even keep up with her instructions. 

Day two: ‚Äúlet me try something else‚Äù, I thought. So I chose the anxiety reduction challenge. The first day I was supposed to write down ways I avoid anxiety. Done. Then it made me choose an activity amongst a few things. One was a mirror pep talk and the other was based on holding myself accountable if I don‚Äôt complete the challenge. Kind of weird and aggressive. 

The final and most HORRIBLE part of the app were the stories to choose from! I picked a story that said under the title ‚Äúit pays to be kind‚Äù. Thought it would be cute. The story starts out relaxing. The voice is great. Then it goes on to talk about the protagonist who kills dogs, makes amputees with magic to spite his competitor, has slaves, and in the end of the story kills someone who stole his ring AFTER MARRYING A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL. I can‚Äôt make this stuff up y‚Äôall. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for an hour after listening to the story. I have 5 days left in the free trial so I might continue to use some of the sounds to sleep but I definitely won‚Äôt risk listening to another disturbing story. 

My last comment is just that the app pressures you to share with your friends or challenge your friends many times throughout the duration of one use. It gets really annoying. The idea for the app is great but the layout is too complex and the actual processes to build habits are to simple. It needs more development.

I never heard back but I kept the app to keep proof of the charge on my account. Now a week later, I tried to reach out to the contact team again and got an automated response and my information has been deleted from the app even though I have technically paid for an (unwanted) annual subscription.

"App didn‚Äôt function for months, developer unwilling to resolve the issue",2021-01-28 15:00:14,False,"Dear Fab-  I updated you. I redownloaded you.  I reset you from setting just like they told me to. So.many. Times. I read you poetry and sang you songs. I gave you the last piece of Thanksgiving pie. But until two days ago, you refused to even show me my setting, coaching, or journey screen. Nada but white. Customer service guy says our difficulties was all me,  but he also said he had no answers and would chat with the developer, so I know the problem wasn‚Äôt just me. Fabulous, it could have been lovely!  I will miss you but I need a more reliable partner!  

When I first started using the premium app it was fine. Then it stopped recording my streaks. I emailed fabulous but did not hear back. After 37 days, this deflated my feeling fabulous bubble. I drifted away from the app after that because it kept loosing my streaks.  It‚Äôs a silly thing, but it felt Ike a letdown when your hard work is lost. 

Flash forward by the fall. I thought that I would give it another try, so I started being Fabulous again. The app had some nice improvements like daily coaching. And then the app stopped working completely on my iPhone 7+. I only got blank white screens. I reached out to Fabulous and, well, customer service has been unfabulous. 

 We had the regular update and reinstall conversations. I continued to dutifully send my screenshots showing the issue. Customer service says he will chat with the developer. We go back and forth. Two months pass with several email. Finally, after the last update, and almost three months, I can see all my Fabulous screen! I reach out and request that Fabulous extend my subscription to make up for the fact that the app didn‚Äôt work for almost 3 months of the year. First, customer service tells me that they cannot do that there is no way. When I call iTunes they reassured me that this was not the fact. Every developer can issue a courtesy code. I circle back to CS and let him know it is possibility for them to issue a code so that I can continue to use Fabulous, a subscription that I have paid for. I am told Fab won‚Äôt extend my subscription because he told me to update the app. I‚Äôm confused because that was the first thing he told me to do and the first thing I did. I even sent him an email about it.

If that is the type of journey you want to be on, Fabulous may be the app for you: unreliable app and uneven customer support. Take your chances. If it goes badly, it could be Fabulous.

Update: the customer service fellow and I are in touch. He says he will see if they can extend my subscription but it may take a few weeks to find out. Will fabulous be fabulous or it is just trying to keep me in the hook?

Update: after over eight emails, and waiting four weeks to hear ‚Äúwhat they decided‚Äù I was offered a code for three months to cover the time my app was not working. The simple (SIMPLE) right thing‚Äîyet the amount of work to encourage Fabulous to follow through leaves me with less than a glowing review of their customer service. Now that I get to try the app I am not sure I want to love it; not excited to support a company with their level of customer service. We will see if they change my mind or I switch to Shine.",Acequiamadre,2,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,
"Difficulty restoring paid account, slow customer service, good content",2021-01-24 20:02:45,False,"Update 1/24/21

Customer service got back to me and resolved the issue promptly.

Overall, I love the app‚Äôs simplicity, both in design and the starting program of habit building. The community element is also welcome. I love the app‚Äôs ‚Äúgamification‚Äù of habit building too.

I‚Äôd give five stars if they made the transferring of your account to new devices more convenient and seamless.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Overall, the app content is good, but I‚Äôm rating the app one star because of unresponsive customer service for premium subscribers and difficulty restoring paid subscriptions when switching devices.

After upgrading from an older iPhone to a new one, I lost access to my premium subscription, so I lost all my saved info and do not have access to all the features. This issue seems common enough since there is a section in their FAQ on how to address this, but none of the steps listed worked for me. I also logged in and out of the app, and deleted and reinstalled the app with no success in restoring my premium account. It seems like others have encountered similar issues.

I subscribed to the app from a website, and it seems that restoring your account from a website is not as seamless as restoring access if you subscribed via the app store. There is no convenient existing user login page on the app or on their main website. I had to search for the existing user login page on a web browser to log in. While this is mildly inconvenient, because I do not have access to my account, I have to log in as a first time user and retake the onboarding survey each time, which only takes a minute or two but still frustrating when you have a paid account with them. 

The FAQ also states that they cannot port over subscriptions from Android to iOS, so this might also be an issue for premium subscribers that end up switching to a different OS. In my case, I upgraded from an old iPhone 6s to a new iPhone 12 Pro Max, but I have not been successful in restoring my subscription and saved data. 

Customer service has not yet responded to my issue; I emailed them about 10 days ago from this writing. I received a generic message from them stating that they are receiving a high volume of requests at the moment. I don‚Äôt know what the average wait time for a response would be, but, again, this feels like a lot for people that paid for the subscription. 

The gist of this is: I paid money for a subscription, and I‚Äôm bummed out because I don‚Äôt have access to what I‚Äôm paying for. It seems other subscribers have had problems too, so for anyone that is planning on paying for the premium service and upgrading their device or switching between iOS and Android, you may have similar issues.

I was pleased with the content of the app, and I felt that the price was fair. I‚Äôd happily rate them higher if I can get my issues resolved.

But the trouble of getting access to my paid account and slow customer service response time may cause me to cancel and get a partial refund if I don‚Äôt get this resolved soon.",BlueberryPancakesYum,4,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

There was some evidence this app wasn‚Äôt built from a foundation of responding to people‚Äôs issues: the founder tells a story of sharing an early version of the app with an influential friend, who said he liked it but found a glitch/shortsighted issue with one of their main features.

WARNING PLEASE READ,2020-05-10 23:25:50,False,"Honestly the concept of this app is brilliant .

It has helped me enormously

I have had this app in the past, and I just recently got it back because I‚Äôm not crazy busy with my life right now. But please be warned, it doesn‚Äôt seem or look sketchy at all, until you actually read into it. I was charged $49.99 for a premium subscription I didn‚Äôt even ask for. And it was horrible trying get a hold of these people who didn‚Äôt even give me a refund.

The strange thing is, these guys not only don‚Äôt have a phone number or an email address, their own support page doesn‚Äôt work! If you have questions that aren‚Äôt answered by their very udimentary FAQ, they invite you to submit your question‚Äî-except the entire submit page is grayed out!

This app would get five stars for me if there was a way to contact actual human beings and get actual answers. Some of the stuff in the app is very tricky, not self evident and or clear and extremely frustrating . Guys you‚Äôd really benefit from putting a couple of scheckles into customer service.

If you‚Äôre fine getting absolutely no support, want the risk of being finned for a subscription, not being able to contact the people who run this app and to get answers to questions you most certainly will have‚Äîthen by all means get it .  

I for one think we will never make a change in the way these companies do business if we don‚Äôt insist on customer service and refuse to give high marks and ratings to companies who clearly don‚Äôt think the customer matters.

And Fabulous‚Äî if you‚Äôre listening, which I doubt‚Äîthat is EXACTLY the message you‚Äôre sending and we all get it loud and clear

Now your probably wondering why am I going on about water this water that. Well it‚Äôs pretty much by default an abstract app to remind you to drink water three times a day. So the app is about one task at a time(water), three times a day which makes up 10% of the app. The other 90% is pyramid scamming.

Notification settings?,2020-03-04 12:55:42,False,"I don‚Äôt need between 6-10 notifications every day from one app, especially an app that claims it‚Äôs going to help me get focused/motivated.

Great App So Far!,2020-02-08 11:49:04,False,"I‚Äôve been using this app for almost 2 weeks now and I can honestly say it actually works! I‚Äôm sure part of it is because you already need to have a mindset that you want to add and/or change certain habits which makes it easier to stick with it, but this app really does help!

I‚Äôve found that every day I make it a goal to try and complete all the habits and challenges I have on the app. The ‚ÄúFabulous Moments‚Äù, ‚ÄúMotivators‚Äù, and little readings here and there make the app more interesting, interactive, and fun to use. There are days when I don‚Äôt feel like completing certain tasks and usually I just force myself to complete it and feel much better after. However, even on those days when I‚Äôm not able to complete everything, the app sort of teaches you that it‚Äôs okay if you can‚Äôt do everything that day so long as you tried your best is all that matters and that helps so much with your mental state because you become more motivated to complete all the tasks the next day.

This app (if used daily and as intended) can help you go from being a lazy person who feels as though they have unproductive days to a person that feels accomplished because they completed all their tasks that day. I really like this app and think I will definitely use it long term to complete my personal goals.

My only issue is that because I was one of the first to use it, I was gifted 50% off my 12-month subscription. However, when I go to purchase it, instead of $24.99 the price states it‚Äôs $49.99. If there was a way for the developers to fix that, then I would definitely go ahead and purchase the 12-month subscription!",jlab_15,4,fabulous-daily-routine-planner,1203637303,

Fabulous is Fabulous!,2020-01-08 03:16:14,False,"Starting the trial I was convinced that I wouldn‚Äôt sign up for the subscription. $40.00 for the year seemed too pricey for me. But once i started,I knew I had to go forward. It is worth the money averaging out around $3 bucks per month! I made the decision that I don‚Äôt want to live another year saying i want to do these things and don‚Äôt. Within one week, I already feel physically better. This app helps establish healthy habits & makes it fun, fulfilling, & rewarding along way! The app is designed so well. i just got asked, because my opinion matters to them - what new habits would i like to see created on the app. I would suggest starting slow on your habits/ challenges you want to start doing. Plus the app won‚Äôt let you select some which is doing you a favor so you don‚Äôt put too much on your self. Its about creating habits that stick.

a life-changer!,2020-01-07 14:26:14,False,"I've been using Fabulous for a few years, and the investment in a Sphere subscription is definitely worth every cent. Want to lose weight? There's a journey for that. Want to break your sugar habit? There's a journey for that, too. Want to learn how to meditate? How to exercise without killing your body and motivation? How to stay on task at work? How to see things in a more positive light? There are journeys for all that and more, plus articles, challenges, recipes, exercises, infographics, and much, MUCH more. I do miss the Habit Heads feature from the Android version, but that's Apple's limitation, not the app's.
