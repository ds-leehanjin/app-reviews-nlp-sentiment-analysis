Even though you have to pay for somethings still, it’s not getting in the way of you using the app. At all really. Are use the free version and it’s still great. Like with some other apps you have to bye like pretty much the entire thing to be able to use the app and if you don’t want to buy it then it’s pretty much just getting in the way of you using the app in its entirety. Which is quite annoying (specially in the fact that that’s pretty much every app out there). I am only reading this app five stars because of what I’ve seen so far. I haven’t been using it for that long clearly, but it still seems to be working. I love how you can customize pretty much the entire thing just to your liking. It is very good with letting you speak without caring. Like when you sometimes need to just talk but you can’t talk to specific people or you just feel like you can’t talk to specific people; yes well now you can. I love how you can just speak into it and not even care. Very good tool for remembering your thoughts and how you felt. Sometimes in the moment you don’t quite remember all of the things that happened to you and that day that you would like to remember and sometimes writing it down just doesn’t quite cut it. Anyways overall this app seems to be pretty good. It’s cute, it makes me feel good about myself, and makes me feel happy overall. I would recommend this app to a friend.",magtb,5,Great!,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I don’t know why, but I feel more collected, calm, and less easily be irritate after I use this app in the morning. I’m just less likely to blow up and scream after my sister doesn’t give me my space and thinks she is the boss of everyone and everything!! This is app is so awesome!! ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ 
  Every great app always has multiple minor flaws. Reflectly only has 1 minor flaw: There price of the special membership. It’s Special 
membership price is about $80 a year. That’s a bit much. The thing says that it will help you become happier when Reflectly helps you solve your problems. I think you should get that no matter what! That isn’t a reason to pay that much a year. I’m not trying to hate on this app. It’s a great app!! I love it! I just mean Reflectly shouldn’t have the price of a special membership be so high! Some people have many problems and don’t know how to fix them. Those type of people need Reflectly to help them with those problems without paying $80!! This is a great app anyways! I think if you maybe take the price away, it’ll be the BEST app that you can have. What’s not to like; you get to know yourself better, not get irritated easily, and most importantly, BE YOURSELF!!",MilkTea&Boba,5,Just like a therapist!!

I really appreciated this and am happy to be starting my new year with this app! Thank you again! 

I downloaded the app and it immediately asked for a year subscription, I was interested and decided to buy. It purchased and had me do my first log of my mood. I did that and everything was great! But then it asked me to create an account so I typed in my email address and it said this is already in use, maybe try signing in? So I backed out of the app to go back to the home page where i could sign in and I signed in successfully. But I checked my account and not only is my first log missing but the subscription was missing and it said ""basic plan active"" so I was confused and clicked on the ""activate reflectly"" and clicked redeem offer to see if when it connects to my apple account it will recognize I have already paid for the subscription. Well it didn't and charged me again because I got a text from my credit card saying I was charged another $63 but the app said ""error occurred"" and never gave me the subscription anyway! Point is I have two payments of this year subscription and no subscription. Please help",Kk11114,5,Updated review!,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Write my feeling, what I did today, but there’s a question... WHY IS THIS APP SO GOOD!! I know I know I’m going to crazy, it’s just I love this app so much that I wanna write again when I was 4 years old I used to write a lot, but when I turned 8 years old I started stopping to write... but now since I’m 20 I wanna write again! I know it sound weird because I’m 20 years old again so i wanna write again!This app is amazing I want updates also! I don’t care if it’s a little update or a big update but..I like it the way it is it’s beautiful 😍 I hope you feel good, this is a quote I made “whenever you see a flower blooming it makes you bloom and grow!” Yes I know it’s kinda weird but it’s true! Your growing and there blooming, I’m not used to write a long paragraph but I think this needs a long nice paragraph 📄, anyways um more about the 4 years old... I also stopped writing because my mom didn’t like when I write!

2020-02-28 12:06:24,"Ok so I really love this app, it’s really nice and aesthetic. It’s so fun to write your whole day down. What your mood was, the things you did today, and then you can look back at all those stories. Which is a lot of fun and very relaxing. 
I do have a couple of problems though. So I was browsing and I accidentally hit the log out button. Obviously you can log back in, but when I logged back on everything was gone. I was literally going to cry. The whole thing was gone, it said I had no stories or streaks or anything. I was able to download my data and get it sent to my email, but I then had to rewrite everything. Which I was willing to do. I started writing one then went to bed. I woke up and looked at it and it was still gone. The poof it’s all back, I don’t know how but it was all back there. Ok my next problem. I do love Reflectly but to only be able to do one thing in not premium is annoying. So basically you have to enter 7 stories and you unlock your status. Then I’m going to look at my status and it says you have to have premium. I will pay for premium but I don’t want to, I’m going to save up my money. I read this in one review and I thought it was a good idea. You could complete like a certain amount of stories to unlock let’s say status. Actually unlock it though, be able to look at it and everything. So personally if this was my game I would do this.

The only thing I am a bit dissatisfied with is the lack of options that the people who do not want to pay a subscription for the “premium”. (Keep in mind that the subscription is QUITE a bit of money!) So reflectly, I would really appreciate it if you guys could add some more options for the people who don’t want to pay the monthly subscription. Other than that, I would love to elaborate on how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! First of all, this app helps so much with daily check ins (if that makes any sense) on how the users of this app days are going, and the way that this app doesn’t just leave us all struggling (this is me) to search our mind of what to write about the day we had— it gives us good and realistic questions to answer. I also must add that the feature of adding pictures to the journals is amazing because you never know when one of us users may want to sneak in a pic of a nice day at the beach, cool food etc. overall, I love this app and am looking forward to the future updates.

2020-05-20 21:12:51,"I just completed my first story, and it felt good to have something to write my feelings down in with major convenience. You don’t have to write anything (but you have the option to), it asks you to rate you day, what made you’re day that way, and how you felt throughout the day (you just press which one you feel, there plate options for this part, no typing required) There are also achievements that you can earn as time goes on. 
*update* 
I’ve been using the app for a while now, and I was really enjoying it, but today when I went into the app it said I had to login, which I’ve never had to do before. I don’t think it ever made me set my email to it or make an account, because I tried the password recovery multiple times and it just said that something went wrong. So now I can’t access any of my previous stories, which I’m very upset about because the main reason I got this app was so that I could go back and read them in the future, and it was more convenient to use than pen and paper. I guess I’ll be sticking to using paper from now on because all of my time just got wasted with this app. I would recommend this app because it has a good layout and it is more convenient than keeping a hand written journal, but for me personally it is not worth the risk of losing it all because the app all of a sudden needs you to “sign in”.",Mb120983746632,2,Brand new and loving it,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
2020-05-12 17:43:15,"This app is amazing. I have tried to start journals before and have always failed. I am not much of a big writing fan, when I would write in a journal I would not get to write everything I wanted because I didn’t want to write that much. My mind was going to fast for my hands so I would write summaries of what was going through my head. This made for a not so good journal entry. I would also forget to write often or just simply choose not to because I didn’t feel like writing. Luckily I am a faster typer than a writer so I am able to keep up with the thoughts going through my head. It is also a lot easier to write everyday because I can choose to get notifications. The app also has an amazing design that is pleasing to the eye ,and all my little entries look super neat rather than my sloppy- tired of writing, handwriting. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t know how go express their feelings or feels like they have no one to talk to because it is a great way to get those feelings off your chest. That is actually why I got this app because I struggle with talking about how I feel so, being able to write about has allowed me to relieve a lot of stress.",TheNauds,5,Love this app,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

So the reason I put this as a four star rating is because to get the fully version you have to pay money. This is the case with a lot of apps, but this one in particular has not a lot of features without paying. I personally don’t want to pay money to get extras in an app that’s meant for writing. But the point of this app is to pretty to much have an online diary so it’s great. The other reason this is not a five star rating is because the app will sometimes delete what I have previously written and make me start over. For example, a few weeks back I wrote in this app every day. I stopped for some time and I today went back to look at my old writing and it was gone. I had to start from scratch with all of my preferences and my name. It isn’t the most convenient but it is overall a good app. It works for me, but if you’re looking for something a little bit more reliable it could be a little bit frustrating. But it has a nice aesthetic and calming effect, so I would recommend for those who need some interaction and somewhere to just process your day or something you are going through.",kittyawsomness,4,Good,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

The check-ins are great, and the voice notes and photos are also a great addition. I love adding a photo or two that highlight my day. The app’s been doing a lot for me, and I love it. However, there are a few improvements that could make it even better. First, the iPad app is pretty bad. It works, but there’s no trackpad support, so things are still pretty awkward. The text formatting is awkward (there’s no cursor, so you don’t really know where you’re typing). I’d like to see a more advanced text editor for journaling with rich text formatting, inline image support, different (preset?) text sizes, bullet lists, the works. After all- the app costs $60/year. Apple Pencil support would be wonderful, it would be great to have a hybrid journal with typed entries in addition to handwritten entries. Support for scribble would also be a welcome improvement. Another great improvement would be the ability to add videos along with images. I’m unsure if Reflectly is already encrypted, but it would be a great idea to include the option to encrypt your journal and its entries with a custom key like Jour does.",thecommamaster,4,"Great app with beautiful UI, but improvements are welcome.",False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
2020-05-18 21:31:47,"So I have been using REFLECTLY for almost 40 days now, it has helped me so so much during the Quarantine. I loved the happy notifications, the thought provoking questions, and the pictures it would give me for each of my journals. When I would be having a bad day, I loved writing about it, and being given a picture of an adorable puppy, or a rainy window with a heart on it. I always smiled by the time I was done using reflectly. I still have my journals, but now all the happy pictures are gone? Sure if I attached any images those are still there, but I don’t get the ones that Reflectly gave me. It makes me really sad and the app just looks bland now. It’s kinda annoying having to sign in every time I want to open the app too. Like I get it for privacy reasons, it just seems silly when it’s on my phone. I miss how the reflectly used to be laid out and I am kindly asking maybe try to come to a compromise? I loved it until it updated, if it’s about like scrolling through perhaps just add like a scroll bar at the bottom underneath your journals how it was laid out to help for easy navigation.

So I will check with google and other apps that need WiFi and they load just fine. I’m not sure if this is the actual app or just my iPhone that’s crashing. I never write reviews but thought that if you (the app developers) saw this, you might be able to try and fix it, if it is the app. But because of this issue I haven’t been able to add stories for the past couple nights.

But after using this app for quite a while now, I believe there should be some modifications to make it an even better experience for users. 
1. Saved drafts: I would appreciate if there was a way to collect drafts of stories and save it. Not only can people come back to the draft to write more, but it can also some tons of time. I once wrote about 1000 words about a day, and for some strange reason, my phone shut me out of the app and my writing was gone. It disappeared. I was so descriptive about my day and it just went away. But if there was an option to hold drafts in which stories would save automatically (such as google docs or something), then I could easily find access back to my story and it wouldn’t have been lost.

With the new formatting there isn’t really a need for a cover image. I liked using cover images to sum up what I did that day like a photo of something I got at the store or somewhere I went that day etc. Aside from a cover image, I do think it takes a bit longer to scroll down and find past entries opposed to scrolling right and left.

I personal love all the aesthetics of a journal. I mean all the pretty colors, the cute stickers, and just the whole concept.

But the ONE problem for me is the price you pay 20 bucks a month about 100 bucks a year and 200 buck for when ever you use it. Now to me that’s pretty expensive. And when kids or teens like me grow up we might not have interest in stuff like this or we might be to busy and I’ll basically end up wasting 200 or 100 bucks on it.

What makes me angry is how I can’t even do my check ins, and I’m confused about what I can get for free. Every time I try to do a check-in, the promotion pops up. There is clearly something wrong with the app, because all of the top reviews are clearly from people who paid for the app, but there are other reviewers that are saying the same thing that I’m saying. Some older reviews even say that there were more features in the past, but you now have to pay for everything. If you are intentionally doing this, that is unacceptable.

Yes, it helps me reflect on my day, get out my feelings without having to have a heart to heart conversation with someone. But having the premium version of the app, I expected more.
I wish the developers would add the option to reflect on more than one category. “Work, relationship, school, food, exercise, etc.” Why wouldn’t I want to speak on more than one category?
I also expected a more personalized approach. Give me more places to type in my goals, habits, something else. I can spend less than 5 minutes on the app a day and feel like I didn’t do anything to better myself.

However, I have a variety of mental health issues, and do understand that a company has to make their money. But the “positivity reminders” are limited to relatively random issues in the basic version. Anxiety, autism, wisdom are available, which I think is awesome. But a large client base is going to have depression and stress problems as well. If those options had tiers, it may be more affective for a wider audience of users. That would be willing to pay for those better options after seeing if the reminders are actually helpful.

I almost decided to say no to one of my meals since I’m overweight, but luckily, I had the brilliant idea to say no to the challenge instead.

It’s very user-friendly. You can add pictures to the days you write your reflections on, and it even helps you actually reflect and think about things in your life by asking you a question every day for you to answer. There’s no pressure to write entries, make pictures or write the answers to the questions.

Reflectly has a a friendly UI and non-agitating color scheme. They’ve only ever really made changes to it once that I can recall. 

     I recommended features to Reflectly and they actually communicated with me on Facebook messenger rather promptly. Come to find out, you can download your Reflectly in a PDF.

So, I would recommend this app to everyone who would put two minutes, just two, and maybe even more, into this app. Because that is all you need to do, to become happier with Reflectly’s help.",Rebecca salazar,5,What I Think.,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I don’t have a written diary or anything so when I’m on the road this is great for when I want to jot something down really quick. One reason I didn’t rate a full 5 ⭐️ was because of how many quotes your limited to.. I like the quotes but there are a ton of them when u subscribe. It just my opinion but I think that if you added a couple more like maybe 2 or 3 small categories for the quotes, that would really make it a great app. Other than that it’s been a great app for writing down my feelings 👍 

-edit I saw the price when I went to the app and I miss judged. Most subscriptions or in app purchases are either money grabbers or scams. This one is actually really good and it’s a nice low price too. Once I get enough I wouldn’t mind going for the premium version.

You can change the settings anytime you want, and you can write notes on each day just saying how it was if you don’t feel comfortable telling someone through text and/or in real life.

2020-06-13 18:42:20,When I first got Reflectly I loved the aesthetic and how it made me feel. When I started to explore the app I realized that things such as a daily question and daily reflection were only for premium users. I looked at how much premium costs ($9.99 a month) and decided it was just to much. I still  like the app and the idea of what there goal is but I think that lowering the price for premium would be a good idea. I understand that they need to make money but for an app designed for mental health I think $9.99 is a little pricey for something that is one of the main reasons I got the app. I was looking for an app that would offer daily reflection and a daily question but I was soon disappointed that the “perfect app” that I was looking for couldn’t offer that to me at a price I could pay.

I’ve captured memories with the “Moments” feature, and love the daily reflective questions! To anyone who needs to talk about their feelings, but can’t seem to talk to anyone, this app is for you.

You can also read others people log ins but not just about any day about certain things like depression and how to help with it witch is super helpful and a great way to get over it, it really felt like someone was there helping me get through it.

The only thing is, is I don’t usually buy premium or monthly payments and stuff so I don’t have all the features so I can’t say the WHOLE app is amazing but the part that’s free is great!

I love journaling but I haven’t really found good times to sit down and work on a journal entry, and this is really easy and simple, while also keeping a simplistic, cute aesthetic! I think this could also be a really good way to get into the habit of journaling if you don’t have a physical journal or don’t want to use a physical journal yet, because it just a simple thing to do, and it doesn’t take very long either!

I have recently downloaded the app, and I come back every 3-4 hours to check-in, as well as read a few motivational quotes. I think the app is great without the subscription, and even better with it. I have one complaint and only one: too frequent notifications. I can always turn off the notifications, but the I tend not to notice apps and use apps as often.

One, you can’t paste text which means if you want to journal by hand, or type using a computer first and then paste it into the app, you’re out of luck. I’ve reached out to the developers for options but got no response. I also wish you could set the time of day you‘ll be journaling. I journal mid day but the prompts assume I’m writing in the evening. A small irritation, but still. That being said it has a beautiful, simple, and mostly intuitive user interface with one exception - there doesn’t seem to be any way to get help from the app. I had to come to the App Store to find contact info and then it sends you to FB messenger to message the company.

Anyways, in the time spent using this app, I would rate it a 4 out of 5 stars. Very user-friendly.

You can reflect your feelings and emotions in a daily “story.” You are guided through the first part of the story where you are asked how the day was. You adjust how the day was by moving a notch along a scale. Next, it asks you why your day was good/bad/okay. You are given many options and another option being to make your own, if the ones given are not enough. Then, you can write your own entry if you feel the need to vent, or if you simply just want to talk about what happened during the day.

I’m so happy the previous titles we wrote have returned! Now we just need the pictures to attach to logs, daily questions, and the logging previous days!

It was originally a wonderful app. I would have given it a high rating, but then the update came. 

The biggest update consisted of: 
-Removing titles
-Removing pictures
-Removing daily question privileges
-Removing being able to log previous days
-Completely messing up the app I had known 

Now we can only post moments and pictures not linked to the moment. There’s no log anymore. It’s just moments. I’ve never had to write a negative review for an app before. I’ve never written a review for any app. I can’t believe that out of all the apps to let me down and make me write a review for it, it had to be this one.

I’m planning to write in this app every single day and cherish my memories here. So are the tens of thousands of people that feel the same way about this update.

Its is so great to use. My only problem is that you can’t see your stats unless you have premium. The reason I have a problem with this is because before you unlock that part of the app, it leads you on that you will be able to see your stats no problem, when in reality you have to pay money for that.

None of that is true. I couldn’t even access the app to try it out and accidentally purchased a whole year subscription — it wouldn’t allow me to change the length of subscription— and it’s definitely not worth the money. It’s misleading and is honestly completely pointless.

For check-ins, it just asks you how you’re feeling and gives you only a few options to choose from. I can’t easily figure out how to change the options. It also only gives me a few options for saying my emotions about the situation. Nothing is personalized and it feels very cookie-cutter. 

It doesn’t send anything interesting during the day. When you set reminders, it just sends you boring quotes that are found on magnets or motivational posters. It has a “morning motivation” but it was seriously just “clean your room”. What? Not helpful.

1. It’s kinda boring to use. I mean, I know it’s supposed to be a journal app, but maybe you should add some fun stuff.

2. The premium. Most games have an optional payment, but most apps don’t. This is one of them. I know you “nEeD tO mAkE mOnEy” but not everyone has the money to afford it. It gives you one free day. ONE. Then the next day, you have to pay the premium. That just makes less people want to use this. Why do you even HAVE a premium in the first place? ITS A JOURNAL APP.

At first, it was simple: just journal as you please. Then, they introduced photos. (One suggestion: just as you can set a journal entry for any day in the past, this should be available for photos, too.)

Just recently, I checked onto the app again to make an entry only to realize that I can’t. That’s right. No more Reflectly Premium - just Reflectly or no Reflectly. That’s it. Reflectly has reserved almost every single feature of their app for Premium users only.

- personal

- easy ui nothing over the top
- simple and clean with a splash of color

- the image integration isn’t great it’s a bit lack luster (it’s nice but not quite there just yet)
- moods and reason behind them are varied but few in comparison

2020-05-01 16:03:56,I started to use this app in October and everyday I would do it. And for something that is supposed to relieve stress- it makes me more stressed with the streak thing. Enough where I freak out when I miss my streak. And I really wish that there was no payment wall of any sort. I would’ve liked to of known how my progress was doing over a long period of time. But it was pay walled. It repeats questions and the options are limited. Maybe I’m feeling down because of myself? Not school or work or family. I don’t see the point.

I want to read that!” But no. That’s the full extent of the app, you answer 3 questions about your day and it’s recorded.

This is an app that asks you a reflection question every day, and allows you to write down how your day went. It offers inspirational quotes and statistics on how your mood check-ins have gone. I thought this app was going great until I was only able to do TWO moos check-ins, then it said I have to pay. I think that’s genuinely so dumb, it should give you so much more time.

It’s a good app to vent to and let everything out that you have been holding throughout the day. I think it’s more of a diary app that asks you questions. 
Cons:
My issue is that you may have to spend money. You want to check your stats? Money. Hotel? Travago. It shouldn’t cost money to do that and I think they are doing it for money and not benefit of their customers. I think they should think a little more about what costs money.

2020-11-05 16:11:11,"The app is very easy to navigate and has a soothing, calm appearance to it. I love how you can make it your own, but also that it’s organized and structured enough to guide you through without feeling the need to write an essay every day. It’s super helpful to be able to track your moods because it helps you identify triggers to negative emotions and thoughts that you might never have noticed otherwise. I love the quotes and the calming art behind them too. When my depression is at its worst and I can’t get off of the couch or out of bed, it’s one thing I can do to motivate me to take that next step forward. Great app all around!

Update - I’ve read some reviews where people are complaining about the price. While I totally understand, you need to remember that it costs a lot of money to develop, update, and just run an app. The people who are working every day to keep the app the best it can be (and who developed it in the first place) need money too! The fact that they’ve avoided needing ads to fund the app for so long tells you all you need to know about how much they care for their consumers. If you don’t have insurance, it can cost $75 just to see a counselor for one appointment. While this isn’t the same as having a counselor, it provides an invaluable amount of mental health benefits in a setting that’s totally personal, private, and incredibly convenient. I can’t call my counselor during my 30 minute lunch break in a 10 hour work day, but I can certainly write a quick entry about how stressed I am, and read quotes that motivate me to keep pushing and stay positive! Simply put, I think it’s kind of unrealistic/unfair to complain about a price that’s honestly very reasonable for all the app has to offer. Ads are my biggest app turn-off all around, so kudos to the Reflectly team for doing the best they can to put food on their own tables and help thousands of people stay alive and stay well at the same time!",Maeghan G.,5,Easy to use even when your motivation is at its lowest.,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2021-01-04 21:20:12,"So I really like this idea but only on day three, I’ve maxed out all my free journals apparently. I didn’t know that I had a limited amount of journals so I kinda just did them whenever I wanted to. I’m a little sad too that there aren’t that many quote options that are free. I’d be great if you could select multiple types of quotes so you could get them all in your stream and personally, I think the sections of quotes that are sensitive like eating disorders should be unlocked for ppl who have that and don’t know how to get help. Honestly an overall great app and the price with all the discounts isn’t really that bad. I just wish there was a way to unlock stuff with like time or activities so people who can’t pay can still get all the qualities of this app. Because I’ve maxed out my journals, I really don’t know if I’ll be able to use the app anymore because I don’t have the ability to pay for now. Later, I’ll update and see where I’m at if the free journals come back or if I pay for it.

Update: after looking at other reviews it seems this app was better before the update. I didn’t know the app before, but I know that the way it is is asking for so much money that I cant do a simple journal entry. I’ll probably have to delete it and find a different journal. It’s such a good app but everything is locked :(

Update: there are plenty of other journal apps with a basic unpaid version that seems to be better than this one’s, so I will be using those instead. I’d rather not have to spend money to do something that should be free like writing.

2020-12-01 15:11:01,"People have been concerned with the privacy policy and the fact that the app knows your name and address. I honestly don’t think there is anything to worry try about because I have had the app for a little more than two years now and nothing bad has happened. And I haven’t been hacked either.

I love this app for two main reasons. It allows you to sign out to keep everything private. And it allows you to express feelings and cope with anxiety and depression. I had really bad depression. And when quarantine came around, things just got worse. But when I downloaded Reflectly, I was able to talk about how I was feeling without anyone actually being there.

I have a ton of personal issues and a main one is the lack in the ability to express and share how I am feeling. This app lets you do that and more. It lets you say exactly how you’re feeling then it lets you say why you’re feeling that way, then I lets you title and save that as a journal update. And if just expressing feelings and emotions I ain’t enough, it also allowed you to add on with whatever you want to add. You can tell what happened that day. There’s no word limit so it’s easy to a lot off of your chest.

This app however does have its rough patches. Whenever you sign out, it save all of your progress, but it doesn’t save the settings changes. So if you have it in dark mode, when you sign out and then back in again it will be back in the default light mode. And the premium. The premium is how the app creators make their money. Yes it is a little limiting as to what you can and cannot do but I feel as if I can get plenty done even with the premium. The premium locks the extra stuff that you can do on the app. So if you feel angry because you think you’re not getting all of the app, you’re just wanting extra stuff when really all you need is the plain app it’s self.

Whenever the premium screen comes up it can be pretty confusing as to where the x is to get out of it. Just scroll down and you’ll see a No Thanks. Press that and it’ll take you out of the premium page.

I hope this review helped you. It’s the second one I’ve written actually. I don’t usually write more than one review but I thought this one would be helpful.",Missylou76,5,Read This,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Honestly, this is amazing. I was scrolling through ig and I saw an ad for the app, and I said “Why not? It looks cool” and I was right. The app is so helpful and calming and helps me rethink my thoughts and actions at the end of every day. Also, I love the pictures that they automatically put on your stories, they’re so pretty. I like how they have achievements for you to earn to keep you motivated. I also enjoy the questions of the day, they help me think deeper abt things. This app helps me have better days because I am thinking about WHY I had a bad day and how I can improve it. I also like the way they send nice little notifications reminding u to make a story for the day. Currently, the corona virus is going around and it’s tough for everyone, and my English teacher is trying to encourage us to keep a journal on how things are going for us because school is cancelled for three weeks. Keeping a journal does help, and it’s nice to have so I can look back at them and see how this virus is affecting me and my situation at home.    ☆ Overall, the app is so helpful and I recommend it to anyone, no matter your situation at the moment, because sometimes, anyone would need to reflect on there day, and I’m so glad I can do that with Reflectly. I hope this review was helpful.

Hi, this is me three months in the future, school ended up getting canceled for the rest of the year a few weeks after I wrote that, and I deleted this app over a month ago. I ended up dreading having to pick up my phone every night and write and it got kinda old. I was writing the same thing every day and it was kinda boring. Also, it was really stressful having to maintain a streak and write everyday and it made me feel worse. I never paid for any of the additional features, but looking back, you’re honestly just paying to write about your day, and you could just write in a journal, which makes the app pretty pointless. I think I started to hate this bc I have commitment issues but yeah. Don’t pay for the additional features, it’s pointless. When I wrote the review the first time, I gave it five stars, but that’s obviously changed. This app is supposed to be tHeRaPeUtIc, but you’re just paying to write.

2020-11-10 19:45:31,"I downloaded this app because I love the idea of journaling and reflecting for the sake of bettering my own (and others) mental health, as well as for an assignment in my Abnormal Psychology course at my university. When I first started it, the user interface was very easy to understand and very aesthetically pleasing. Although I became very disappointed to find that almost every main feature of the app can’t be accessed without a monthly subscription. At first glance, it doesn’t seem like it has many restricted features. As I used it more and gained “access” to my stats, I was sorely disappointed that I can’t even look at the trends of my moods and feelings throughout the time using the app without paying money. I think this app has a lot of potential and is a great concept but if you’re looking for a way to reflect and evaluate your own mood, I suggest buying a cheap notebook from the store and writing in it and looking back at what you wrote after a specified amount of time rather than paying a monthly subscription for essentially the same function, but with more statistics and numbers. Or even better, you might as well go and get a real therapist for the kind of money they’re asking for. 300 dollars for a lifetime subscription is ridiculous for something that offers so little, with no human communication or contact. 

What this app does do good with: I do appreciate the motivational quotes that you can endlessly scroll through, but this is not a selling point for the app whatsoever. Additionally, I think the main feature (mood check in) is very good. The mood check ins are a great starting point for reflection on mental health as reflection and self-awareness are typically key-roles when trying to identify things like mood disorders and worries. This app also does a fantastic job of monetizing people’s mental health, specifically their poor mental health, which can be seen as a good and a bad thing depending on who you are. 

Overall, my search for a quality mood reflection and journaling app does not end here. I would say this app could be so much greater and much more versatile if the only free function available wasn’t “what’s your mood today?”. I don’t believe that is a truly efficient way to help a person or yourself when there are tons of better and cheaper ways to go towards that’ll be more beneficial in both the short and long term. Also, At the end of the day, nothing beats human connection when it comes to improving and reflecting on your day and how you feel.",EPArrow,2,"Great concept, poor execution.",False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-04-23 23:04:02,"Overall a great app. I really appreciate the mood stats to see the way my mood has been changing throughout the weeks, the added journal prompts.

Some things I’d change:
•typing isn’t completely user friendly, sometimes I have to type something before I paste text into the entry because it won’t let me long press into a blank line? Then I have to go back and delete whatever I just typed. Annoying and time consuming.
•it also won’t let me highlight text to delete or redo etc, I have to backspace one space at a time which is really annoying and time consuming. 
•I wish I could upload multiple photos at once instead of doing each one individually. Again it’s annoying and time consuming. 
•I keep getting connection error messages and my photos aren’t saving. So I have to keep re trying. Annoying and time consuming.
•when I go back to edit a story and click into the text box and then try to click in the daily notes text box it won’t let me. It won’t even let me click “done” to remove the keyboard and switch texts boxes. I have to exit out of the entire app then move into daily notes. Annoying. Time consuming. 

If I keep having these issues within a month I’m just going to cancel. I really wanted to love this app but all of these small errors being so constant... meh. I feel like I can find another journal app that doesn’t make me annoyed at minor details, or I might just stick to putting things in my notes since I don’t REALLY need those fancy mood stat charts and journal prompts.

2021-03-04 20:45:21,"I have to track my emotions daily for my therapist, and this app has been really helpful. The clean, aesthetic design and the little clicks when you finish a note really help to incentivize mood-tracking. 

The only thing I would want to change is some of the user interface. Specifically, setting up new activities/emotions is awkward; instead of having to archive them if you want to make any changes, I feel like you should be able to edit the ones you’ve added in your settings so you can change the name or icon. I also think it would be nice to have the option to change the icons for pre-existing activities/feelings, or even archive the ones that aren’t relevant to your life. FINALLY! I think you should be able to choose multiple categories for the quotes you can get, but that might just be in the paid version, I’m not sure. Because of all this, I’m rating it a four out of five stars. This is a beautifully built, satisfying app, so these little issues end up standing out. 

I also have some suggestions. The lack of these features isn’t detrimental, but I think they could go a long way in improving the app. First, it would be great to have a simple goal tracker. I’ve seen these in other journaling apps and I can’t help but want them on your app. It wouldn’t have to be much, just a simple list of goals, maybe you could go in and press a button to say if you’ve succeeded. A second suggestion — you should be able to write quotes to yourself! I find the pre-existing quotes don’t really work for me, and I would love to write myself messages that I know I will need to hear in the future. 

I will also say that I think the price of the full version is a little much for what this app is, but since the free version isn’t too restrictive and doesn’t have ads, it’s not something I’ll complain too much about or take away stars over.",lunarsimulation,4,"Great app, but could use some UI tweaks",False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

I’ve been using your app for a while, and feeling Hello developers of Reflectly, 
I’ve been using your app for a while, and feeling little bit more better managing my emotions reading positive affirmations, check in my recording my mood, and so on and so forth. Some things which could be improved is include more emotions, and unfamiliar emotions when logging to check in with how you’re feeling. There isn’t good selection of moods or emotions so I would appreciate if there’s a feature to record down the emotion or add way more moods, and unfamiliar moods. 

Another one is many developers who makes apps includes subscriptions, and I appreciate the discount to pay per year. I think it would be more fair if there’s one time payment that’s not overly priced, and affordable, there are people still out there who can’t stand subscriptions, and instead of complaining I use the free features, and it would’ve nice if you include a one time payment which is affordable to get access to all the features. 

Overall it’s a well built app, although I like to recommend the developer if we could customize, or add our own images we get from the internet to our own liking for positive affirmations, and customizing your profile where every iOS users sees an image of their profile picture, and other wonderful things on the app. It’s a really well made app and I’m glad there are people who actually cares for peoples mental, and emotional well being.",VictoriaSilvis,4,Incredible app for nurturing your mental and emotional well being + some feedback,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Like honestly struggling to get by and don’t even have 50 on my credit card and you keep trying to charge me! Who wants to pay 50 for something like this... or for anything insane. Don’t even try to download had to call Apple support to get it cancelled and it’s been undownloaded. Seriously if you look at my app history it’s only downloads for zero dollars I don’t even buy one dollar apps I hate how things can get ahold of your info and do these like this.i am lucky my card kept declining and my credit card notified me so I could find out and cancel this charge. For me I usually only get about 70 dollars a week. I don’t have the money to spend on extra anything. So trying to take 50 dollars from someone thousands of dollars in debt who can’t even afford rent, and is always broke no. Just no. You make it sound like something free  it was something I downloaded one secound and didn’t even log into and they tried to charge me. Not cool. I honestly don’t even know what the app does because I’m scared to put card info in to things. And you tried to charge me anyways? Consider a free option and maybe like. 7 dollar a month charge this is one time I am happy I only had 2 dollars in my credit card out of a 500 dollar limit... I’m not about to waste money I need for food to provide for my child etc but after reading reviews I write in an actual physical journal and don’t need an app for that.( and write poetry) seriously who charges this much money not even Netflix or actual therapists.

2020-05-29 08:49:08,"Reflectly really helps me to express my feelings. I keep a journal that I use to write significant things that happen that I just need to get off my chest. But reflectly really just helps me talk about my day and vent about what I need to talk about that nobody really needs to know.

Things I love:
   -The thumbprint lock. I love the lock because I know that things I don’t want people to hear are kept safe from others. 
   -The color changes. Personally I am a very visual person and I think that the color changes really help me like when I get bored of it, I change the color and it’s a whole new aesthetic.
   -The Moments. I like to be able to write about my day and just kind of evaluate the way I feel about things so this is good for me.

Things I don’t like/ I think need improvement:
   -The premium feature. I understand that you may need to make money so by adding the premium feature it gets you that extra money, however I would like to be able to at least answer the daily question because I like doing those sort of things.
   -The amount of emotion features there is. I feel like sometimes I don’t have an emotion option that accurately describes how I’m feeling and I just think there needs to be more emotions. Same for the activities and things. 

These are all just my personal opinions based on my experience with the app. And I’m sorry grant was super long but I tried to separate it out so you didn’t have to read the entire thing😅I do love this app though. It is very good for my mental health to get everything I’m feeling off my chest.

2020-05-19 05:14:07,"I really love this app. It's really everything you'd want. I've been using it for around two months now, and it really does help me vent, but then the new update came...
I appreciate the idea, but it's just not as nice as the old version. The only good parts about this update, in my opinion is that it allows you to put multiple memories per day, has more activities, and moods, and allows you to pick more things at once. But, I miss the old layout already.
It was much more appealing and mood lifting. Brighter, and the happy pictures and big faces really helped show things. It was easier to look through the things that had happened. And also... I'm not sure if this is just me not being able to find it (which shouldn't really happen, it should be easier to find things), but I can't chose titles anymore... I really liked being able to pick a random title to look back on and question. Now, I can't do that. And a couple more things... the fact that the app logs you out? I get the point, but it's kind of annoying. My password on my phone does a good enough job of keeping people out. Chances that they click on this app are extremely low even if they can get in. Just seems unnecessary.
Here's one of the last things
The atmosphere of the app is so much different.
It feels too... professional I suppose. It's just so dark and kind of gloomy in a way. Writing in the blue box, or whatever color you picked, instead of a white one just isn't my kind of thing. It's too distracting and just seems weird...
And also, I'm not sure if the questions were moved to premium of if you got rid of them, but bring them back...
That's pretty much it.
Like I said at the beginning, I really do like this app, it's just that the new update kind of ruined it for me.",Meow200789,3,Hey,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-07-01 18:19:20,"I’ve really enjoyed this app and it’s become part of my daily routine. I really like the “daily reflection” question BUT I wish they put in a bit more effort as the questions repeat quite often. I’d often get the same question 2 or 3 days apart, which feels like a missed opportunity. 

I get that maybe your perspective changes with time, but not within a week (not to these kinds of questions). Maybe repeat a question every couple of months if you have to. They need more questions because it’s probably only going to get worse as I’m only about 6 weeks into using this app daily and I’m already seeing a lot of repetition...

It’s genuinely interesting to me to have to think about these things and to write down my answer but if it comes up time and again, it just feels like a lazy implementation and it loses value. 

I also think the mood slider could be worded better. I’m not doing “Really terrible” but also not “Pretty Good”, the only other option is “Completely okay”? That doesn’t feel accurate. Could just be me. 

The morning quotes and challenges can also be very cheesy and impractical (like, they just wrote a bunch of motivational cliches down without much real thought, it feels like it’s shoe horned in for the sake of it) but that’s just personal preference I guess.

Other than that, it is fun to see my stats. Especially as I build up more of it. I’m definitely going to continue using it. I like it. Addressing or investigating some of the things mentioned above could just make it a lot better.

2020-04-09 05:02:31,"I’ve been using Reflectly for almost a year now, and it has really helped me; it’s very therapeutic to write down how your day has gone, and I love how simple the app is.
Unfortunately, for the past two weeks or so, the app’s functionality has been less than ideal. 
Sometimes, when I change a simple setting, such as the color scheme of the app or turning on Dark Mode, the next time I open the app, it almost seems to have reset itself to its original settings.
Luckily, my entries have never been deleted or tampered with, but that’s about all I can give it as of right now.
A few minutes ago, I typed out a rather lengthy, but under 3,000 worded(because I’m not on the Premium Plan), entry, and when it got to the end of it, titling my entry, and went to save it, I got a banner saying that “There was an error while saving your entry. Please try again.” So naturally, I did just that. 
I got the same banner.
I turned off my WiFi, turned on my LTE, and went to save it again.
Same banner.
I turned off my WiFi, waited ten seconds, turned it on again, and tried again.
Same banner.
I ended up having to exit out of my entry, effectively deleting it.
The experience was more than a bit frustrating.
I went to make another rushed entry, only to be met with the same error banner.
Once that happened, I just exited the app entirely, and now I’m here.
I like this app, I really do.
I wouldn’t have been using it for this long if I didn’t, but these issues that have been piling up for the past two weeks are negatively affecting my usage of this app.
At this point, I don’t know if this is just some scheme to get me to pay for Reflectly Premium, but regardless of whether it is or not, I will not be doing that any time soon.",Adia Ivory,3,Love the app’s purpose; functionality gets janky,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-05-20 10:23:41,"i loved this app... but i don’t like this update at all. i tried to log in the past couple of days i missed because i’ve been very busy, just to notice the new update, which takes away the ability to write stories for previous days, make a title for stories, add a cover for the moments, and now you have to pay for reflectly premium to have the daily questions. i found joy in adding covers to my moments and often add stories days at a time. i love this app, and has been a big help for me to get my feelings out into writing which has reduced so much of my stress by getting things off of my chest but i really hope that they can bring these features back, or else i might have to find a new app.

*edit*

i’ve never written a review for an app, but this... this was my favorite app... but this update ain’t it. i just hope the creators can just bring back the ability to change dates so i can log in older days, and to bring back the daily question for free, cause why should we have to pay for everything... pay for happiness?? i feel it’s extremely unnecessary to have to pay for half the app... and for the price that they’re offering🤦🏽‍♀️ like i could get netflix every month for the price of getting a question a day (that was once free) and for this app to tell me how happy i’ve been. i also liked the former layout better because we could set the cover pictures, and that’s how i separated my days. one thing that the former version of this app didn’t have that id like them to include is a way to search your stories based on title, or based on liked stories. this was a five star app turned into a 2 star overnight. this app has made me realize so much in my life. logging in stories for each day on this app has been my only way of remembering what i did each day and including the details, and pictures from that day. on bad days i’d go back and read about the good days i’ve had and that brings me joy. i don’t know what i’d do without this app and i don’t wanna have to uninstall it because i’ve put my heart and soul into this app for the past 240 days. please fix this.",southwest_cheeto45,2,what is this update??,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-03-15 03:54:59,"[see next paragraph for my review]
REPORTING BUG: For some reason when you are typing, double tap does NOT highlight the word (like it normally does on iPhone), and if you “long press” to try and move the cursor somewhere (which is what happens normally), it decides to highlight the entire word instead. The “short press” to put the cursor to another place is kinda hit or miss, it doesnt always work, not sure why... I never have that issue using other apps!! Please make the cursor & tap responses aligned with regular typing - this bug making the keyboard functions all opposite is getting REALLY irritating, and decreasing my propensity to use the app!

REVIEW:
I really like this app, and as other users have mentioned it is pretty relaxing! I love the pastel colors / soft tones, and the user flow is very easy. The rounded corners and cute faces/icons are what adds to the vibe of this app. They have beautiful images too, for your entry, or there’s an option also to upload your own images for the day:)

I used to have a journal, but I didnt like wasting paper, and I also had an online diary, but remembering to log-in on my computer everyday seemed like a chore, so I never kept up with it... I love being able to do this quickly on my phone once a day, it really lowers the barrier to keeping up! I’ve been writing something every day for over a week, which is something I never thought would happen!!!  Huge step for me.

I do find it disappointing that I have to pay to see ANY stats.  Of course getting into journaling again was a goal of mine, so just for that, the free version has been good... But a BIG selling point on their end was the AI capabilities, which I don’t get to reap the benefits of.

Perhaps there are other ways to set up revenue streams, aside from charging us to see any stats? Maybe a Tier system, where the Free version has Basic stats, and as you pay more, you can see more stats, and get more personalized displays / recommendations based on the AI’s analysis... things like that. Most apps using freemium model have multiple options in the app for users to decide what to pay for, not just one. Get creative & make stats free by offering other paid functions!!

For Example: I think a really cool thing that I would love (if I had the money), would be different ways to display my entries visually. Kind of like a digital version of an info graphic  or calendar, or the option to sync the entries with my other calendar apps (google cal, iCal, period tracking), or even the option to print out your entries on paper in a cool poster/comic type of away!! So many possibilities.

Clearly the Reflectly team has an eye for aesthetics, so I think that would be a place where they could shine!!",athenas7,3,"Very nice UI, a little buggy, must pay for data",False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-07-29 03:56:12,"I’ve never written an app review before but I feel strongly about this. I got this app right about when quarantine went into place, and I was using it as a way to process my conflicting and confusing emotions about self-isolation. It was so therapeutic and one of the parts of my day I looked forward to... getting to go through all the motions of creating an entry with daily quotes and questions. 

But the new layout has completely changed my experience. Most of the functions you initially had access to are things you now have to pay for —which is super lame and inconvenient (especially for a teenager who was just appreciative for the space to vent and process). With the pictures gone and the significantly shortened daily entry options, it is much less pleasant, and quite frankly, a disappointment. 

Also, I am prone to writing in my journal right before I go to sleep. Often, this is past midnight, and my entries are therefore automatically logged as the day after the one I am writing about. It was incredibly efficient to be able to select the day before to properly keep track of my progression. This function is now gone. [*edit this particular function has since been remedied] 

Overall, the update was a total let-down and I would much prefer that it reverted back to its previous version. Of course, I am only a consumer, but isn’t that the point? Shouldn’t that be enough for my opinion to matter? Otherwise what is the point of customer feedback? I don’t mean to be dramatic but like I said, I feel strongly about this, and if a touch of drama increases the likelihood of drawing attention to my concerns, c’est la vie. 

Please take my complaint into consideration.",a. s. baer,2,Recent Update is 👎,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-05-17 02:55:52,"honestly i’m very sad and disappointed with this app. i have loved it so much since i first started journaling in february. i got this because i love to look back and read over my days from the past, and i love journaling, but i would never be motivated to do so. i also wanted this to be able to vent and try to help with the average 13 year old girl emotions and insecurities. i have loved this app and been journaling every day since i got it, however just recently they did an update. when i opened the app this morning, i almost cried because i thought the app had deleted all of my stories and my account. i have the free subscription. luckily, i had the account written down, but if not i would have lost all of my stories, and they mean so much to me. if they were gone, my heart would have broken. i checked out the new version to find that the app was completely different. i could not journal for missed days, which i loved, and i couldn’t journal for one day and have a title and all that. all you could do were “moments” and i hate that. i also found that the meaningful prompts were gone! completely removed. that was one of my favorite features of the app that you wouldn’t get with a normal journal or even most apps. i am also disappointed and confused with the new layout. i loved the old simplistic and pretty layout of the old app, it was interesting and easy to navigate. now it is weird and confusing. i am so sad that this has been messed up in the way that it has. i plan on deleting this if it is not fixed and back to normal. please fix this app back to the amazing app it used to be.",reviewer823,1,disappointed,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-05-19 20:39:49,"I am a big fan of your app, and I have been using it since January. It has helped me with SO MUCH. I used to love writing my story, answering my daily question of the day, titling my story, and getting a cute cover for each story. I also loved to favorite all of my stories, and go back and write a story for days I missed. Everything was so organized, and the colors and formatting were beautiful. 

Yesterday when I went to write, I got logged out of my account. Thankfully, I remembered my password and stuff so I didn’t lose all of my stories. When I got into my diary, it looked so depressing. All of my cute covers were gone. You can’t even title your stories anymore. I used to love writing a catchy title for my story each day. You have to pay for the daily questions now, which I don’t like cus I cannot afford premium. You also cannot go back to another day and write stories from days you missed. Everything is in a timeline, and in a mess. Formatting is awful. You can’t change the background color anymore-heck you can’t even LIKE or HEART a story anymore. 

I really used to enjoy this app, but now I am not really liking it after this new update. This new update is making me anxious, and depressed. I feel like I can’t write anymore, and it makes me feel terrible. Lots of other users are complaining too. Not just me. This update is very unsettling. I can’t even do what I want with my diary anymore. I am very upset. 

If you can bring back the old version, you would make everybody’s days-especially during this difficult time. PLEASE REFLECTLY. BRING IT BACK. 

Otherwise, you are going to lose customers, and your app is gonna suffer a tragic financial shutdown. 

PLEASE. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

That is really frustrating because we already don’t have all the features for free, and now you take away the free journaling altogether? That’s pretty lame.

2021-05-20 02:56:16,"First, they charged me $30 for a premium subscription when I first opened the app. (Quick background, I'm a 32 year old engineer and understand how to use an iPhone, but still somehow accidentally paid for a year long subscription.) After two days of not being able to use the app, I was finally able to create an account and log my first journal entry. 

As soon as I finished, I was offered a ""special deal"" for a now $60 premium subscription marked down from some even more absurd amount. After turning that scam offer down, I was finally able to use the app from the main menu. Only to find out that I had apparently only paid for a basic membership, which I was under the impression was free. That's when I noticed the ""just for you"" button with a heart at the top of the screen.

Well, just for me, was another offer for a premium membership.... This time a little cheaper at only $18 for an annual membership. Clearly this raised some concerns so I found the settings/menu of the app - which confirmed that I only had a basic membership, contrary to my credit card statement that clearly shows a $29.99 charge. I immediately went to my subscriptions through my apple ID to see what that said and, of course, it showed that I have a premium account. Go figure. Now, not only did I have a premium account, I had a $60/year premium account. That was the final red flag for me. 

I'll be filling a complaint with the app store and immediately notifying my credit card company of this fraudulent charge. 

I came here for help. I'm extremely disappointed. I strongly suggest not submitting your mental health to this.",HeneRJ1000,1,Scam,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

Never thought I’d be writing a review but here we are, reflectly let me start by saying helped me through my anxiety. I had anxiety problems since 2020 September, 9, 2020. What involved me into anxeity was because of the 9/11 attack, me being myself I looked up on that day about 9/11 on YouTube. I watched these movies trying to make a remake of the movie, I watched clips and it made my brain at the time feel sad but never scared. That night, I couldn’t sleep I never new why or what it could be cause I can always sleep. I also had no sugar that night, it was strange. I kept breathing heavily but I didn’t notice it, I couldn’t sleep for a long time till I had to take a sleep pill. I was shaking and it was bad. This anxiety lasted for 2-4 days. I tried looking up calming videos on YouTube but they actually never helped me once, not even a little. I this staying up late messed up my beautiful sleep schedule to the point where I almost stayed up all night. It was bad, I was flunking school and on top of it with covid 19 I thought this was the new me. Luckly I never had a anxiety attack. I started looking up apps to help me sleep and then I came across reflectly. I downloaded it then tried it, I started to written my feelings and I saw quotes. They helped me calm down. They also had friendly calming reminders for me when I needed it through the day. I do recommend reflectly because not only did it help my health, but it’s kind of fun! After a few days of the app my anxiety faded away

I have skipped over these ads because I do not want to buy and have no intention of buying it in the future. I skipped over that add today and was about to write a check-in when I then get the message saying something along the lines of “Woah, we see you trying to write so we’ve decided to make something special for.” I believed that this was going to be a nice note or just something sweet for the users but it was actually an add for reflectly premium again, however this time, I couldn’t get around it.

2020-06-22 16:11:19,"During the on boarding process, you have to choose a subscription option before you can start your free trial. There was a round about of going to the App Store to choose your subscription, and there was a multitude of prices without descriptions $9.99/mo, $29.99, $47.99/yr etc. Apparently, not all subscription types have a free trial. I was charged $29.99 up front without the free trial. I would’ve been ok with it if I were given that info, but I wasn’t. 

My suggestion to devs: Make sure users are fully informed of what they’re purchasing. They trust you with their money. This is especiallyyyy if you’re gonna have them sign up for a subscription before they even start the free trial. 

Because I was charged unknowingly, I am not even considering trying the app. I contacted your CS, who directed me to itunes to get my refund back. All I got was “I’m sorry, we’re not responsible for billing. You need to check in with Apple for that.” CS couldn’t even look into why? Or explain to me the different subscription options??

That may sound like a bargain but it’s not really a revolutionary app. Plenty of other apps have the same features this one just includes more detail.

I could log info away, share photos of important memories, be encouraged by little reminders, and review past entries. That was all with the old version.  However, the new format has made it so I cannot go back and add entries for previous days! This is a huge problem because I would journal about the previous day when I would wake up in the morning.

        Over all I love this app. Very calming, anxiety and stress relief, and stress the best. Then again the premium offers aren’t the best part of this app, that is the only flaw. 
        The lifetime plan makes you pay $299.99 which I think is ridiculous. He yearly plan makes you pay $29.99 which is better but still not the best. The monthly plan makes you pay $9.99 which isn’t bad but it can get annoying paying that kind of money each month. Also it doesn’t even give a choice for a free trial. A free trial would’ve been great because if I didn’t like how premium worked I could decide if I needed to keep paying for the plan, or if I just stayed with how it was without premium. 
        And then the last thing, it is glitchy. I was typing out how my day went with the app one day, then it was typing what I wanted to type at some time and then it exited out of the app it’s own, then it deleted my two paragraphs of work I wrote. Thank you for reading this!

Hello I see that you wanted to scroll Here to this symbol  so you didn’t have to read the whole thing. Over all I like the app, I don’t love it.

There would be a spot to talk about my day AND a notes space.

Reflectly is like your own personal diary.This app even has your on Face ID/Fingerprint to open up the app to keep your privacy safe!!! Like how cool is that!! I think it’s very thoughtful for our personal space well I think all these mental health apps are very thoughtful and they have good intentions but some apps just don’t work.But it’s ok! I would also like to recommend some things to make the app more AWSOME then it already is.

Recommend:
-Instead of having a different app (Vent) for talking to ppl about your health there should be a section on the bottom where it’s (Vent) the app but right there in the app Reflectly. I think it’s way easier for others.But this is just my opinion!

-Add somewhere in the app where we can tell the app what our mood is and why and then either Reflectly answers or Reflectly keeps it and shows your different moods through the week/month/year to see if you have improved your mental health.

-You should add a calendar that keeps track of your moods as well where it shows each mood on the calendar.

-We should have someone to like talk to (In this case Reflectly) we tell him what’s wrong and he responds with what to help us with it would help us a lot more!!!

2020-05-01 14:32:42,"@DeondraDDavis wrote a review a YEAR ago that is very similar to what I think about this app, and I’m kind of upset the developers haven’t updated some of the points she brought up. In particular, as a premium payer, I was disappointed to find out I couldn’t copy and paste. This feature is important to me since my thoughts are all over the place (as you might be able to tell from this review), and so if I have the need to write my thoughts immediately, and I want to skip all the questions about how my day was or whatever options I have to click through to get to finally writing in Reflectly, I opt for opening the Notes app, and just pouring out my thoughts and feelings. But since I love the privacy of Reflectly and that it’s literally the best diary ever, I found it annoying when I later attempted to copy my note and paste it into my journal entry for the day and couldn’t. I ended up having to screenshot the note and upload it as a picture, which was time consuming. So please just add a copy and paste feature. Also, of a bit lesser annoyance, why would one of my journal entries be listed twice? There’s two copies for April 24th. I don’t know how that happened. And lastly, there’s a glitch that happens, I’m not exactly sure what triggers it, but sometimes it’s as though part of the screen is not showing. It’s usually the bottom part of the screen that has options I need to tap, but can’t because for some strange reason only half of the button is showing, and I can’t scroll down any further. For example, the last time I noticed it was when editing yesterday’s entry last night. When I had finished, I looked for the “save changes” button, but it wasn’t showing at the bottom, like it usually does, so I tapped on the “X” at the top right of the screen, and it said my changes wouldn’t be saved. So I went back to look for the save changes button again or any other way to exit the entry. I didn’t find any, so I went with the “X”, exited the app, reopened it, and my changes had been saved, which was good, but my point is, why weren’t part of the screen options showing?Thanks beforehand for reading this!",Josette1995,3,"I love it, but could use some minor fixes",False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,

2020-02-05 21:56:21,I love this app. It’s amazing. And I’ve only been using it for a week or so. Now your wondering why I gave it four stars and not five. Well there’s a few things I don’t like about it and think they should kinda be fixed. Anyway like I way saying...If you the person who just loves to write down your feelings and talk about them then this app is for you. (LOOK NO FURTHER). But if you someone like me who likes to look at there past days( like daily moods or streaks) then you would have to pay some money. (Which I’m broke and have non). But. Other wise I love this app. I love how you can do different things. There’s also one more thing. It’s that when I try to see my stats it say you have to weight this many day or this many. And I’m kinda of impatient when it come to weighting. Keep in mind I’m also like a week new to this as well.anyway I just don’t really like that you would have to weight for things or engender pay for them. So yea there’s ALL the things that I don’t really like about this app. Otherwise I LOVE everything else. I like how you can kind of talk to “someone” about your feelings and how your day has been. Like I don’t know if I’m the only one but I don’t really like talking to my family about things. They just make everything seem like it’s my fault and it’s mainly not my fault. It’s other people’s fault for getting on my nerves. Also I’m not that type of person to type really long ratings or even rate apps in that matter. But this was so good that I just had too. Anyway I hope you all enjoy this app and have a nice night or day. ☺️☺️,Real Micheal Jackson,4,Love this app🙃🙂. But... (read pls nothin r bad.,False,reflectly-journal-ai-diary,1241229134,
