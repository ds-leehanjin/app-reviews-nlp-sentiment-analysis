For example, Headspace was responsible for helping me establish a regular 10 minute per day practice that I have maintained faithfully every day for the past five years. 

I supplemented my meditation with other apps from time to time. And recently I discovered Meditopia. I like this app best of all. Mostly because of the combination of soothing music that has a special quality I‚Äôve not found elsewhere, and the quality of the woman‚Äôs voice that guides the meditation. 

There‚Äôs something about the blend of music, voice, and the words she uses, that make this meditation the most enjoyable and most relaxing of all the apps I‚Äôve tried. 

So there several really good ones, but this is the best in my opinion. Of course, my opinion is just one perspective. You‚Äôd have to try it and come to your own conclusions based on your unique preferences. 

But, if you‚Äôre looking for a good meditation app to try, this one is worth checking out for sure.",False,meditopia-meditation-breathe,1190294015
