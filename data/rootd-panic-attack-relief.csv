Bwinchester92,"I downloaded this app three days ago in the midst of a panic attack. I used the rootr button and went through the prompts a few times until I felt a bit calmer. There is not much that can help me when I’m in the middle of a panic attack as badly as that one, so the fact that it brought me even a little but ofpeace helped. It was especially helpful to be reminded that I have survived every other panic attack, something that is easy to overlook in the midst of one! I also love the journal feature, it makes it easy to keep track of my panic attacks and also look at the good aspects of my day as well. Unfortunately, due to financial reasons, I don’t have the means of upgrading to the premium version but I would definitely look into that if my situation was different. The developers definitely deserve it. The only suggestion I have is to add a few more helpful reminders while using the rootr button. I went through it three times before I felt calm and the sayings started to lose the effect after the first time. Other than that, great app!","{'id': 16059696, 'body': ""Thank you so much for this lovely review! We're happy you found Rootd!

Lizzy0826,"I downloaded this app right after i had a panic attack and a friend told me about it. so far it’s helped a lot when i have my panic attacks . when my panic attacks start or i feel as if i’m going to have one i hit the rootr button and it gives me two options , help me feel okay and let’s do this which are very helpful because if i just need a little bit of assistance with my panic attack i can hit the let’s do this button then it still gives you help and walks you through a little bit but it is a lot faster then if you hit the “help me feel okay “ button it says a lot of different things that help make you feel okay. and you can even tap the screen to have them read aloud to you. and it keeps going and asks you if you feel the panic had ended and if you hit the no button then it keeps going through things but if you hit the yes button then it’s over with . overall i gave rootd a 5/5 stars because of how helpful it is .","{'id': 23557384, 'body': 'We are so so happy Rootd has been helpful.

Abdjdjskdj,"I have never written a review for any app before, but I had to for this one if it means possibly helping someone. I have tried many anxiety relief apps that I ultimately end up deleting because they simply aren’t effective. They always seem so limited and robotic, and this is a breath of fresh air from that. It makes me feel supported, like I’m not going through this alone. There are two options for when you need help, which adjusts to your mood, depending if you want to be comforted or if you feel like fighting your anxiety that day. There are features that make this journal seem more honest and real, instead of just going through the motions. Honestly, thank you for this. If you deal with anxiety on a daily basis or get attacks, I urge you to get this app. You might find it more helpful than you expect. Wish you all the best 🤍","{'id': 23027267, 'body': 'Thank you so much for taking the time to write your first app review.

ana!&@,"I am really grateful for this app! I have started having panic attacks recently and was very confused and worried about my health. I have done a few medical exams, but did not find any serious issues. However, every time i am starting to feel anxious, i keep on thinking that something is wrong with me and wind up having a panic attack feeling like i am suffocating and losing ground. Reading the Rootd explanation of how panic attacks work really helped me calm down and prevented an onset of another attack. Just by having an app on my phone i am already feeling more confident that i can deal with a panic attack (which hopefully won’t occur at a level it has before simply due to the knowledge of having Rootd support).

Future Mrs. ,"i really like this app. i mean REALLY like this app. i wish we could give half stars because it would be a 4.5 star rating. the only thing that keeps me giving a 5 star rating is that the education or techniques are seemingly limited and don’t renew themselves. 

i tried the premium version on a week trial base. i even found myself wishing for more techniques and education to be available because i had gone through a great deal of it. i couldn’t help but wonder whether i would eventually get bored with this app and forget that it existed or move onto to something else that seemed to better meet my need for a little more variety and choices. 

that aside, i do enjoy this app and find it helpful and the graphics are adorable. great job rootd.","{'id': 21997097, 'body': 'Thank you very much for your review.

I had been going to therapy but it wasn't really helping me understand how to deal with panic attacks when they're actually happening, and I would often just cry it out. Thankfully, this made my attacks much shorter, it's so user friendly and I really appreciate the affirmations it comes with in the SOS feature... while most apps just have a breathing graphic, I feel like I personally need affirmations during attacks and this is perfect for that.","{'id': 22204828, 'body': 'Thank you so much for your feedback.

Megaudc,"I’ve been dealing with and learning about anxiety my whole life, and Rootd is one of the first apps that truly helps. Unlike the ones in general meditation apps, its “panic button” concentrates on the feelings of severe anxiety only some people face. The fact that the watch app speaks aloud instead of requiring headphones is a godsend. I do wish there was volume control, but I don’t think that’s a fault on the developer’s end. One thing I would say would push this over would be being able to select a number of “motivation notifications” throughout the day. I’m saving up for the lifetime version.","{'id': 23267992, 'body': 'Thank you so much for your lovely review. Really like your idea for motivating notifications too!

AllTheNicknamesAreTaken121,"I’m new to this app, but here are my top points so far

- The breathr tool—the visualized breathing thing helps, especially during anxiety. The free version of the app only allows one-minute increments, but there is no amount limit to how many times you can do the one-minute ones (that I know of yet)

- the Rootr tool—this did help me during a panic attack. Although, if you keep having a panic attack, it gives the option to call your contact person. I didn’t have this set up, but seeing that option come up during a panic attack did give me anxiety because I didn’t want to call someone at night. Granted, like I said, I didn’t have that option set up... but the panicked mind doesn’t think logically.

I think it’s a useful and good app overall. It’s worth a try, there’s plenty that you can access even on the free version.

But note to the developers: another review mentioned adding games: this is a good idea because distracting the brain/doing tasks that require thinking helps me personally with panic attacks.","{'id': 19409760, 'body': 'Thank you for your review, feedback, and suggestion.

Happy to address the points below :) \n1) the understanding lessons in Rootd are completely free and will stay that way. They help you understand what’s going on during a panic attack and provide the tools you need to manage them. The only paid lesson content is the short and long term lessons, and they are for when you’re ready to use Rootd to manage panic attacks and anxiety for the long term.

Weird.One,"I have panic attacks semi consistently so every couple days to up to 7 in one day. One time I really wanted some help with it of them and found this app. (I can’t get medical help at this moment sadly) I conscientiously used this app for the first time during one of my worst attacks lasting more than an hour and just being able to listen to the facts helped. I like how when using it during an actual panic attack it is really easy to just continue with just one button to press. It helped a lot at first but slowly the effect of telling the facts did nothing for me. There are not too many and they get old after a while. I find myself just not believing them at all now. I wish there was a little more that could help someone during a panic attack. I tried to then use it to just keep track of the panic attacks but it seems like it doesn’t count the panic attack if you go through it semi quickly. I think this is to stop people from farming them and being able to brag about getting through however many panic attacks but that’s not really a thing that someone would do with something like this. There are some features that cost money but something like this doesn’t seem like it should but I’m ok that they are there because it is a whole lot better than an add popping up when you are suffering.

UPDATE: an update just came out and have seemed to fix the issue of some panic attacks not being recorded.

UPDATE 2: when you finally are able to be confident enough to be able to go to the orange button (don’t know what to call it exactly) almost 200 panic attacks in it feels so good to actually beat it that way.

Yermel,"I can only speak on my experiences, so I love this app! The content of this app, it has helped me through a very stressful and anxious week. For some reason this week alone I’ve had daily panic attacks, but this app has helped tremendously with relief. I love the factual information they send you with the panic button. I can’t recall what I already know when I’m in a panic state; I lose all sense of reasoning and fact finding, so reading the information in this app helps a lot with returning to a coherent calm state, and reminding me of what I already know about panic attacks. 

My favorite part is Rootd’s push to help you overcome and understand your anxiety issues from a root cause level, rather than just a quick fix. When on the purchased version they provide tools to help you investigate and resolve your root issues. This helped me identify several causes of my panic attacks from this week, and I see some long term patterns that have been toxic in my life. I am starting to build confidence and feel in control again! 

So now the reason for 4 stars instead of 5:

I ran into a snag with the purchase. I bought this on my laptop, and the directions said to open up the app on my mobile and restore purchase. It didn’t work. I tried multiple times across multiple days. After three days of no success I contacted support through the website contact form. No response, ever. I finally found the email to contact the company directly through my emailed receipt. Once I got in touch, they validated my purchase and unlocked the premium content on my account. Phew!

I also love that I can use this on my Apple Watch, although I’m having some trouble with it freezing up, but I think the bugs can be fixed!

Some suggestions: I would love an open writing journal section along with the guided questions! Also just a few kinks with the Apple Watch use working smoothly. I would also love the option to text my SOS person from the app as well, maybe some already written out statements, so it’s an easy click! Part of my treatment plan With my therapist is to text (not call) an SOS to a chosen friend to encourage me to do my breathing exercise when I’m feeling too out of control in a panic attack, so this is amazing!

Hgdgiyg,"UPDATE: after posting an honest review of my experiences using this app, the developer responded with a rude and intentionally condescending response. Totally uncalled for in every way. I will no longer be keeping/using/recommending this app simply because of the developer response. Judging by the way they specifically mocked several parts of my review and insulted me for giving honest feedback, am sure they do not care. 
If I could give zero stars I would. One star for the idea (and because it’s the lowest I can go).

Original Review: I love the idea and direction of this app...
That being said, I used the Rootr tool (big red button) in a calm positive state, and it sent me straight to an anxiety attack. Statements to the effect of “feel the anxiety and invite it to come back again” and “feel how your chest tightens and ask for more” are horribly triggering. I understand the point is to overcome anxiety by not allowing it to take control of me, but I found these prompts or statements counterproductive to conquering my anxiety.
Also, the little monster face on the app icon looks terribly stressed out and is not so inviting for me to use when I’m struggling.
I am going to keep the app for now and keep an eye on any changes or updates.
I really wanted to send this to a good friend of mine, but as it is now I am worried it would cause more harm than help.","{'id': 14221568, 'body': 'Hi there, \n\nIt looks like you may have not read the lesson on the Rootr tool (big red button).
