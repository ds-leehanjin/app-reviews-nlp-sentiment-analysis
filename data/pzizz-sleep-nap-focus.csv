One night, During a particularly bad bout of restlessness, i downloaded Pzizz out of desperation for sleep. At first it felt cheesy, but I figured it was harmless at worst. Surprise, surprise...

I suffered many years of sleep issues and insomnia.  I found ways to manage it, eventually, using cognitive tricks, which worked, but I needed to go to bed early every night to avoid anxiety and stress and to ensure I got enough sleep.

I tried Pzizz to focus at work and also later as a gimmick to go back to sleep in the middle of the night when I awoke.  To my surprise, I slept faster and deeper and awoke far more refreshed.

Fast forward a month and I gave up my cognitive tricks because this app works.  I am far more relaxed about sleep at night and feel fresh every morning, only using the app when I wake up and can‚Äôt sleep.  I get back to sleep and wake up fresh enough every day, and I don‚Äôt stress.

2020-07-17 16:14:27,"I used to love this app; I mean seriously loved it. I recommended it to several others and I have never done that with ANY app for anything.  But now.....The new interface is clunky. The list format for the narrations was much easier to scroll through than the random size & placement of the large icons. My eye doesn‚Äôt know where to look on this layout. I still can‚Äôt figure out how to add a favorite. And what is the difference between favoriting something or starring it? No helpful written instructions as to navigating the new -fangled controls. And with that one previous statement I‚Äôve revealed myself to be a dreaded boomer. So be it. Lol 
The narrations (as far as the ones I‚Äôve listened to to date)now focus too much on breathing. They all feel like meditation sessions. The focus before was more on mentally relaxing you and letting go. 
One change I do like is the ability to delete the narrations that don‚Äôt work for you, thus clearing up storage space. 
But the real deal breaker is the new male voice narrator. He sounds like a stage actor. In fact, somewhere my brain is telling me I‚Äôve heard this guy before. And for entertainment purposes I‚Äôm sure it works very well. But your previous gentleman had a voice like liquid butter. Soothing and well modulated. This new fellow is somewhat gravelly & much too basso. Enunciation of consonants are too hard and overly pronounced and his s‚Äôs too sibilant. I realize this may all be very subjective, but one likes what one likes, and I personally find it grating. If I had heard this changeover before my subscription renewal time arrived, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have renewed. 
My husband says to give it time to settle into my ear and I might like it better. I‚Äôll try, but I‚Äôm not at all certain as to the outcome. 
A pity. I know the push for new and improved is what drives commerce. But I‚Äôm old enough to have learned that the maxim of ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù is often the outcome of improving things.
