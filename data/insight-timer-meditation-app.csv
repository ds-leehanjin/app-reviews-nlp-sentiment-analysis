Lunabeat,5,2021-05-26 18:29:09,Unable to leave reviews for meditations,"The review button on the site is broken and users are no longer able to update old reviews that we have written or leave new ones. This problem started about 2 weeks ago. I have emailed the app about 6 times over this period, but nothing has been done to fix the problem. 

I am in the habit of listening to new meditations and then leaving reviews (which are never negative) so I know which meditations I have already listened to, which I love or merely like. I enjoy reading the reviews of others as well. So the fact that this review button is not working is a problem. 

Otherwise, I love Insight Timer. I have been using it for 3 years and 3 months and have clocked over 10k minutes of meditation. The topics are varied and interesting. I bounce around a lot to new meditations based on the topics I am working on in my life. I find some of the meditations to be incredible and in the style I enjoy and others to be just good, in my opinion, but not my style. That is why the review button is so important, so I don’t unintentionally begin a meditation that I have already listened to in the past and just found to be ok, but unmotivating to me.",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
SammaSam2012,5,2021-01-13 16:30:48,Best Meditation App By a Mile,"Insight Timer is by far the best meditation app available, I’ve tried all the top apps and nothing compares. Most of the other major meditation apps are focused on selling you hardware or a subscription - Insight Timer is free and has additional content you can pay for but it’s not built as a “money machine” the way the others are. Plus, there are legitimately excellent, experienced and trained meditation instructors like Tara Brach who post free guided meditations to get you started. My only “complaint,” if you can even call it that, is that there is now a TON of essentially worthless “woo-woo” visualization exercises and “healings” posted by an increasing number of “meditation teachers” who clearly have no training or credentials and are just using the app to build an audience for their personal brand. It didn’t used to be like that, but now it’s common to see three pieces of new-age nonsense for every one actual guided meditation. I worry a bit that beginning meditators would easily get sidetracked down an endless rabbit hole of “mind candy” and miss the core point of meditation - training the mind to be present, empty, and completely open.",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
SMDOK,3,2021-06-05 20:49:44,"Wonderful app, illusory privacy “rights”","I really love this app. I’ve been using it for several years now, paid and unpaid, and it does not disappoint. I have tried other products and they do not work as well. Unlike other consumers, I do not want a social network, I want a sleep app, and this one absolutely does the trick. The problem is data collection and an utter lack of any privacy rights, including third party giveaways. I was completely prepared to renew the paid version, and then I fully read the, in my opinion, wholly illusory “Privacy Policy”. 
However, I have requested opt outs and “shine the light” under the California privacy rights laws TWICE and I have heard nothing. (I understand that this app uses Google Cloud AI; there are cookies that can stay in place for two years. This, it seems, has added to the value of the app due to automation eliminating costly pesky customer service.) Now, perhaps other people are just hunky-dory with giving literally all of their personal information out with no limits, but I’m not one of them. I’m waiting to renew until I hear something about addressing my legal California privacy rights. (I’ve read in other places that there is little customer service for this app and I believe it.)

ErikaLMoon,5,2021-04-28 09:33:00,I’ve been using Insight for YEARS!,"Truthfully, there is no better app for meditating whether you are just beginning your journey or have already found and are simply improving your zen. You’ve found the app you are probably looking for. The guided meditations are my favorite because my brain has a habit of wandering off to things I need/want to do later, maybe a conversation that already happened, where the person is going whose loud car just drove by... so listening to someone else guide my thoughts into focus by following my breath is EXACTLY what I never knew I needed. They have tons of instrumentals you can choose from, which I have used before and practiced yoga or just worked on something with it playing in the background. Oh my, and endless sleep sounds like will knock you ouuuuut. The actually timer within the app, I honestly probably use the least. So, if you are on the fence about if this should be the one you download because you don’t just want to delete after a few weeks or months because you didn’t get out of it what you thought... you do what you choose. ✨",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Cateink,5,2021-02-13 13:42:43,Try it. You’ll like it.,"I love so many things about this app. First all the meditations, playlists and live feeds are free. It’s really important to me that everyone can have free access. That being said, I upgraded to get the extra perks, but mostly to support IT, so it they can continue to offer all the free stuff. That’s the goal. One can also contribute to individuals teacher, one can support that way which starts at 1.99 (US). Drawbacks: it can be overwhelming when one first encounters it, but the daily suggestions, playlists, and live feeds introduce new teachers & meditation types, mitigating the overwhelming number of meditations. So do the search features. The other drawback, in my opinion, is it’s seems they aren’t vetting their contributors as carefully as they used to, and some teachers don’t have credentials in meditation, mindfulness, yoga...., but they consider everyone an expert. Still I highly recommend it for beginners & novices. It’s changed my life for the better, and I recommend it to my therapy clients, many of whom have started their own practices.

Tiigraine,3,2021-03-24 15:25:06,Have to pay to rewind,"Overall I think Insight Timer is pretty good.  There is a ton of content you can access for free.  It can be a bit to dig through to find what you like, but once you do, it’s a great resource.  However, if you’re listening to a talk and want to skip back a few seconds so you can write something down, tough luck.  There are ‘skip back’ and ‘skip forward’ buttons but if you click them you’re redirected to subscribe so you can access the ‘advanced player.’  The abundance of free content means I’ve never felt a need to shell out $60 for Member Plus status.  I’m certainly not going to for the privilege of rewinding.  Also the rating system is weighted towards good reviews.  I started listening to a 45 minute talk that turned out to be very amateurish and condescending.  I discovered that Insight Timer requires you to listen to at least half a recording before you are allowed to review.  I understand why they do this, but it seriously skews results.  No one is going to sit through 23 minutes of that talk just so they can leave a review.  With this policy in place it’s highly unlikely you’re ever going to see less than a 3.5 star average review.

My eight year old also uses the kids section and we do meditations together because of this app. I don’t really go for the “online community“ aspect, but that is active if you want it. The range and selection of meditations is phenomenal and IT has expanded amazingly over the years, now with live classes and yoga... everything I try is great. Music is also a feature I use. I recommend IT to a lot of folx with insomnia, you can reach for your phone in the night and turn on a sleep meditation, it works!

Jgrimsley6,2,2021-02-24 12:32:33,Big let down.,"I have been using insight timer, on and off, for a couple of years but never without difficulty getting the timer set the way I wanted. I wanted interval bells and got them but never at the intervals I had them set for. Recently I decided to contact insight timer for help with this issue and the only thing that they found appropriate was to send me two notification emails with nothing in them except the automated response that they received my email and someone would contact me, they never did that. I try to meditate, partially because of almost nonexistent self esteem. It took a lot, for me, just to ask for help and then, for all intents and purposes to get completely rejected didn’t help at all. If a company isn’t interested in helping a customer then why bother with having a customer support contact in the first place? A giant let down from another company pretending to have customer support.

Update: While I did receive two email replies to my request for support it is still disappointing to me to think that it took leaving a negative review to get that support.

I started listening to daily insights, only for 10 minutes a day, and  I discovered fantastic teachers through that daily activity and that led me to taking courses and it has now become a morning ritual for me: instead of reaching for my phone and getting all upset about work stuff first thing in the morning, I now take a class and do 10 min daily insight meditation. This ritual lasts 25 minutes. And I love it. On top of that the yoga classes are also fantastic, there are so many resources on this app that it is worth every single dollar spent on a full membership for the year.

LeAnonymousReviewer,5,2021-02-05 07:03:31,Love it!,"I’ve been using this app on-and-off for the past couple years now. So far it is my favorite meditation app because it gives your hundreds of meditations to choose from, a large majority for free! The fact that many meditation apps are paid is what held me back from getting into meditation in the first place. I love that this app is mainly free and that we don’t have to follow a given meditation plan (if we don’t want to) and that has helped me discover what meditations I like and don’t necessarily like. I’m personally very bad at keeping up with a streak and there are times when I don’t meditate for months, but Insight Timer is always the first app I go to when I try to pick up the habit again. I even recommended this app to a few patients (I’m an OTA) who wanted to improve their mindfulness and increase their emotional regulation (and because it’s free so there’s no reason not to download!). Can’t recommend Insight Timer enough!!",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
The Best Food Blog Ever,5,2021-01-17 22:10:24,This skeptic loves it.,"As a recovering evangelical, I am extremely allergic to all forms of woo. But I’d had so many friends talk about how great this app is, so I finally decided to give it a try, starting with the sleep meditations. I don’t have a hard time falling asleep, generally, but I do struggle a lot with falling *back* asleep if I wake up in the middle of the night. The sleep meditations saved me. Every time I’ve used it, I go right back to sleep. I’ve started using them at bedtime, and it might be psychosomatic, but I’m definitely waking up far less now than I did before I started making the sleep meditations a regular practice. 

The regular guided meditations are really great as well. I have never been good at keeping my mind focused (which was why prayer was always hard for me, lol), and I’ve tried meditation on my own, but never really hooked into it. There are several absolute beginner’s courses which have been a great starting point for me. Looking forward to getting into it a lot more! 

Literally the only change I wish they’d make is being able to filter individual artists’ offerings. Like: I can go into the sleep meditations, sort by the longest, most popular, etc. But if I go into a specific artist’s page, there aren’t the same filters available. It’s a minor issue, and doesn’t detract from my love of this app at all. 

Anyway, great app, highly recommended.",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,
Addicted to puzzle,5,2021-06-02 17:13:03,Problems,"Unfortunately recent updates have made the app more glitchy and less useful. I have used your out for a while.  But it seems that it's become more difficult to use the simple timer.  The need to constantly tinker with things and the inability to leave things as they are seems to be a problem with all technology. It seems that you have missed the point of what you're trying to teach. Less is more.  Just to use the timer now, which I find glitchy and sometimes pauses for no reason, it is necessary to be asked if you want to do a daily check in. Why? I want to start my meditation and first I have to answer a question.  There is something wrong there. Why complicate very simple thing?  I think the assumption is this everybody needs guidance, but please don't interrupt something that is so simple with what you think someone might need.

Jai-Jagdeesh,2,2021-05-17 06:12:14,Today’s update made a mess,"Folks, hi. I’m a longtime user of the app, and have seen a lot of nice improvements over the years (I haven’t loved all of them, but that’s beside the point), however, today’s update was a real bummer. I suddenly have a ton of old (deleted long ago) presets showing up, many of which have something in common with current presets, so there was a vet & delete process to go through to be able to do my practice this evening... and that was not easy because the updated user interface is *reeeeeally* jumpy. If my finger didn’t hit the center of the very small ‘delete’ button **dead** on, I’d be taken *out* of edit mode, and the preset would load up as if I’d chosen it for a practice. I had to backtrack from that jumpy accident about a dozen times to be able to fulfill the ‘delete’ mission. Not the end of the world, but also not my favorite moment of usage within this app. I hope it can be calmed down a bit (without reloading any deleted stuff). Thanks!

Schofield Massage Therapy,5,2021-02-12 12:04:42,This app has helped me mediate,"I have always tried to meditate and felt like I could not calm my mind and thoughts to really tune in. I felt I needed to have a spot in my home start first thing in the morning, laying down or sitting, etc.
This app and more importantly Mindful Mornings has been a game changer. Some meditations that I listened to told me if I couldn’t lie down or find a quiet spot to just do it where I was. So I have meditated in my car with this app on my way to work....I have meditated while doing the dishes...I have sometimes meditated in bed before starting my day...and I have meditated a couple times with my 3 year old.

Thank you for being out there and here, every day.  Thanks to all 9,000 - that was a year ago!  Now how many? plus free meditations.  Blessings to all who gather here, wanting a more awake, aware, authentic and connected existence and a more balanced Universe.

Of course there are levels now which is understandable but frustrating.  Kind of like boarding a plane and knowing I am not a gold member.  But part  of my practice is not to compare so it offers opportunities to learn. 

I am finding for  me, I need to find more time for silent meditation as I am wanting the guided more and more with so many choices.  Of course I find those that resonate with me and let go of the rest.

The mindful mornings challenge they promoted helped me build a good daily habit and they promote black teachers in support of BLM and Black History Month.

You can tell everyone - literally thousands of people each - “Thanks for meditating with me” individually if you want.

The only things I’d suggest are 
1) make the meditations count toward your milestones across all devices (my friend lost milestones across devices with the same profile) 
2) make the live sessions count toward milestones (I lost 50 consecutive days of progress because live didn’t count and I didn’t realize it), 
3) maybe add an exercise component (cardio), &

For years the app has worked pretty well but recently has stopped. It doesn’t track my sittings accurately making errors everyday and hasn’t shown my friends or others activity.

When I reported these failures I received an email stating a new update would address these issues. It hasn’t.

I don’t know what the problem is but suspect management is more concerned with capitalizing on the apps more complex advanced features than taking care of its basic core features.

Unless this app is repaired soon I will abandon it. It doesn’t work as well as a timer. I’ll miss my friends from this app but since this feature has stopped working using the app doesn’t provide any benefit other than practice dealing with frustration.

RiennaKay,1,2021-04-27 20:53:37,Honestly horrible,"I’ve been paying for insight timer membership plus for about a year now.

I just noticed... that the app never registered that I pay for a membership. 
I’ve had limited access for this entire year.
I can only listen to the free meditations. I cannot join classes or download. I constantly keep receiving ads to buy the membership, when I press it, it tells me that I am already subscribed, then I try to chose a meditation and it goes back to saying I need to buy membership. 
I literally cannot do anything that they promised I’d be getting when I pay. 
It’s been an entire year and I’ve been ripped off. I’m so upset 
I’ve emailed, called, wrote on Instagram, wrote teachers, I have no idea how to get what I'm literally paying for. I loved this app so much it helped me out of a dark time.
I’m sad to take my money elsewhere. I hate paying for absolutely nothing. I feel like I just donated to insight timer lol. Tired if these online companies ripping me off and not correcting their mistakes.

Shiessica,3,2021-04-07 12:16:24,Excellent content & instructors once you get over the buggy software,"I’ve been using the app for about a year now and the content / instructors and live events are incredible. I really enjoy the circles feature that allows you to connect and meditate with people all over. The tracking option gameifies it which helps me stay motivated.  I love the platform and would have given it 5 stars except that it is so darn buggy! I have opened at least 10 different support tickets by things that should have been caught by their developers or QA team prior to releasing. 

I will add that I am a QA tester of apps and software for a fortune 100 company so I might be prone to notice (and less accepting of) these things (unable to enter live event, unable to send thanks for meditating with me messages, etc.). The number of development related issues experienced by me, and others I meditate with on the app is wild. Being in the field of technology I take it on myself to open these tickets since I know how to troubleshoot them to make sure it’s not a user error and to help others on the app experiencing the same. Tech support asks a lot of users who open a support ticket - screen shots, then screen recordings, then allow them to log in as you, emails from multiple people asking for the same thing ... they are all incredibly helpful, professional, and polite, and I believe doing what they’ve been instructed to do, but it’s *a lot* to ask for someone who isn’t being paid to QA their work. 

The content though, again, is incredible and I find a lot of value in that. Only marking it down because of how I find the user experience when I have to open a ticket to report something g that’s not working as designed.",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,"{'id': 23146532, 'body': ""Thank you for your feedback.

zerotimesinfinity,2,2021-06-18 22:02:02,Getting worse with each update,"They are moving further and further afield from the original point of this app, what was to be a solid and reliable timer for meditation.  They seem to be focused now on adding what to me are pointless social media features like the new mood tracker. It wouldn't be such a big deal except every update also introduces new bugs which make the timer harder to use and less reliable. With this latest update, all the timers I had created were placed in a random order and I had to spend about 20 minutes putting them back in order. Now, when I change a timer and save it, it is saved out of order and I have to go back and put it in the correct order again, which, because the interface is so clunky, takes about 5 extra minutes. Worst of all, now about half of my mediation sessions are logged with the incorrect time and I have to go in and manually edit the logs to record the correct time. This also has such a poor interface that it takes way more time to do this than it should, especially since I now have to do it for about half of my sessions. As an example, one of my 35 minute sessions was logged as 7 and a half hours. Another 20 minute session was logged as an hour and a half. The whole point of this app, and the reason I had been using it for so long, was to accurately keep track of my meditation time so I could look back and see how I'm doing over a period of time.

helpineedaname,5,2021-06-27 14:46:15,Amazing,"Unlike a lot of meditation apps, there’s A LOT of quality material on the app that’s free.  No free trial - then pay, there’s no pressure to subscribe to the full site.     There’s so much variety and I can’t imagine how someone wouldn’t be able to find meditations, music, talks or live events to meet their needs on the free side.    The variety and quality of material is phenomenal.    And I’m really starting to enjoy getting more into the circles (Or communities).     

I’ve tried quite a few of the other meditation apps out there and this app is just on a different level than the rest of them.   Truly in a class of its own.   

I like that we can subscribe to get enhanced features.     I also like that we have the option to donate to individual teachers as well.    I also just love the variety of material that’s available.   If I need a 10 minute meditation, I can sort and find something.    If I wanna listen to something longer, I can find that too.   It’s so easy to navigate!    

This app was a life saver for me last year during the height of the pandemic.   I recommend it to everyone I know w/o prompting.   I am not a paid spokesperson and rarely gush like this about apps I like. 

 I simply love telling people about this app because it helped me change my life for the better - and I didn’t have to spend a lot of money to make these changes and explore my spirituality more deeply.    I’ll always be grateful for the skills I’ve learned because of insight timer!     

People are wasting their time, effort and money trying to use other meditation apps.   I’m speaking as someone ‘who’s been there and done that.’     Insight timer is truly a game-changer.    Much love and gratitude.  ❤️❤️

sunsunsf,4,2021-02-01 14:52:56,love IT and how to improve,"first I love this app, I use meditations almost daily. it’s is my companion in a time when nearly all my other routines and comforts have disappeared! 

here are a few ways to improve. 

there should be a section of life events that you have selected for yourself, you can see “my courses“ but you can’t see your life events with a schedule 

from the iPhone app you should also be able to add them to your calendar

The sound doesn’t work when I play meditations or yoga live stream sessions on my laptop, only from my phone

Once a session is live, it should say when it started, and what the session is! If you have noted to attend a few live sessions at the same time, the app will only tell you their live, and when you click in the session is going on, but there’s no way to see the description of the app and remind yourself what you thought you might

finally and possibly most important, you should be able to set up a “watch next“ list! Sort of like a playlist, this way I can tag meditations that I come across for a later time, and explore different teachers. This would really help me understand different teachers, instead I spend a lot more time scrolling through trying to find them again 

please be encouraged this app has been my friend through Covid, through loss of job, through a second break up in this pandemic, I really appreciate everything you do!

Definitely not Schwa,4,2021-03-28 16:10:50,Unmatched library of great meditations with room to get better,"I’ve used both the free version and paid version of Insight Timer for 3+ years. In terms of having access to some of the most amazing, well known, and even unknown teachers with lessons to share, I find the app to be great. I’m a casual meditator who tries to log at least 5 sessions per week, so I use the app somewhat regularly. For casual and intermediate meditators, I think this app will serve your needs. I can’t speak to advanced and expert level because, well, I’m not there and not sure what that level requires in terms of support. I have a hunch that an app is probably not part of those needs, but again, that’s not where I’m at.

I do think the app and experience could be better in a couple of ways. First, I signed up for a 12 month membership that was recently renewed. I didn’t receive an advanced notice of this renewal which was a bit frustrating, but in the world of subscription services, this seems to be common practice. I wished the team would have provided advanced notice of the renewal because had they done that, I would have chosen the free version over the paid service. Mainly, I use the guided meditations, talks, and timer, all of which are available for free. I thought the courses would be a more regular part of my experience on the app, but they haven’t been, so that’s one area I felt the customer service/marketing teams at Insight could have taken initiative and not fallen into a practice of assuming the user is aware of the renewal date. 

I’ve enjoyed the playlists that have been created by the team, but they aren’t really discoverable. This could be my lacking of knowledge on how to discover them, but even if I type in “playlist” into the search function, none of them populate in the results. I’ve found some of my favorite guided sessions on playlists, and when trying to rediscover those, have not been able to because 1) I admittedly didn’t save it 2) I remember the playlist but not the meditation name and 3) Playlists are just not visible anywhere in the experience.

All in all, it’s a great app for meditators looking for support in their journey. I would recommend this app, though I would personally say “stick with the free version”. The value of becoming a paying member just didn’t really deliver for me, but now that I’ve been renewed for another year, I’m going to try and take advantage of those “extra features” afforded to paying members while also keeping a close eye on that renewal date so I can respectfully decline and stick to the free option. 

Happy meditating everyone!",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

justin 937392973737,1,2021-06-26 18:35:26,Paying customer denied access to account and accused of violating race hate policy.,"I have been an Insight Timer user for 5 years and a paid customer for a 3-4 years. I use the app everyday and love love love the classes, teachers, and meditation. This is the space I come to for rest everyday and I am very grateful for the app. 

Last month I was having issues logging in and tried multiple times with password, apple Face ID, Facebook ID, and resetting the password through my email. It then prompted me to contact customer service. This took them a couple weeks to get back to me and i tried multiple mornings to access my account and allowed this to frustrate me when I was trying to meditate and start my morning ritual. Universe testing my patience I guess!

When Customer service (Vivian) did return my email, they accused me of violating their race and anti-hate speech policy inside the chat rooms and course classrooms and threatened permanent termination and told me to sign this policy (which I’m sure I already signed) and they would allow me to have access to my account again.

I replied letting them know that I don’t use the app for messaging people or chatting in rooms, so my account must have been hacked and I don’t appreciate being accused for something I don’t partake in when I’m a paying customer and if they need me to sign something to access my account I can do that but please look into my history and if someone has hacked my account.

A week or 2 later Vivian gets back to me apologizing and reinstating my account without me signing anything but still didn’t answer any of my questions as to what happened with my account. She actually implied that there were still complaints about my activity in chat rooms and classrooms.

I rewrote her explaining again that I don’t message people or use chat rooms or classrooms to communicate with other members and could she please investigate my account and find out what’s going on or if this is an internal issue.

A week later I received an email reply encouraging me to fill out a customer service review and not answering any of my question or looking into the issues with my account. I plan to fill that out shortly after this. At the time I ignored it and they allowed me to use the app for a couple more week.  

Now back to real time, yesterday I was trying to set up my mom on insight timers and wasn’t able to access my account. I went through the same process multiple times of password, Apple ID, Facebook ID, email password change with no luck and more frustration. 

So I can’t access my account again and they advised me to contact customer service so I did yesterday I’m sure I will hear back from Vivian in 7-10 business days…

Love the app when they allow me to use it, super lame customer service on so many different levels.

L Blechman,5,2021-05-10 13:27:33,Insight Timer has actually changed my life,"My husband and I have been dealing with has stage four cancer diagnosis sense March 15, 2020. It is been the most challenging year of my life and his.
On February 11, 2021 he had a very intense, 11 hour surgery after being told three times that he was not a surgical candidate. 
He had a very advanced signet ring cell carcinoma that had spread throughout his abdomen. 
I begged him not to do the surgery, his cancer is considered the “mother” and that her job was to spread and make millions of “babies”, those babies are stem cells that are undetectable by science or healthy cells. The job of the “babies” is to attack when mother is threatened. Mother is threatened when she is removed surgically. It is an in curable cancer.
My husband will not listen to me, instead, he listened to his sister and brother. 
He has not only still in the hospital, primarily and ICU, he hasn’t eaten since February 22 and I have been living in the hotel six hours away from home. He also had to be taken by helicopter to their big hospital in another state. 
During the surgery they removed half of his large intestine, all but 4 feet of his small intestine and now has a stoma, they removed his gallbladder and spleen, the entire lining of his stomach and it was caked onto his stomach so half of his stomach is gone too.
When the oncology surgeons from Sloan and MD Anderson told him that if he attempted to do this surgery, his life will never be the same. They were not lying. 
He now has so many holes in his small intestine that he couldn’t eat if he wanted to. He has been septic and just got another infection and when this clears up he will be transferred to an ICU type facility aka an LTACH. 
His big surgery has now turned into 3 and currently has tubes coming out of his abdomen to drain all the fluids, pus and output from his ostomy. 
He finally knows what my name is but the oncologists were right, he’s never been the same. 
Insight timer has been the one single thing that has kept me spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally able to get up each day and do what I have to do as a wife and sit my husband side 7 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Sadly, his cancer load was SO high, the stem cells are already coming and it is only a matter of time but this man is a fighter!! He won’t stop moving forward and I think our long haul will continue but at least we’ll be closer to home so friends and family can come visit.

ktronelemenopeq,5,2021-05-05 06:59:32,"It’s the best meditation app currently available, recommended to me by my therapist","I think it’s only a short matter of time before insight time reaches an optimal level of user friendliness and overall organization/simplicity. It’s so close to being at its best, and while it can be difficult to traverse at times, I get so much out of it and its VAST library of all kinds of different types of meditation/mindfulness practices that I have to give it a 5, but it’s more like 4.5... When family sharing on the iOS app is possible, along with what I listed above, it will be perfect. This app was recommended to me by my therapist and my nutritionist, both of whom emphasized how much MORE content was available on this app, as well as how much MORE helpful content it has than comparable apps (I switched over from the calm app). There’s no comparison in quality, and the vastness of different levels and types of content available on insight timer, as well as the capabilities to connect with friends or make your own meditation circles, join all kinds of live classes that are available at all different times, the journaling capability is super helpful, and the app keeps your activity logged in a small variety of ways. You can personalize your privacy and just about everything else on the app. Favorites, personalized playlists, and many more options available to make using this app genuinely helpful for anyone who is interested in personal growth and progression. The superiority over other meditation apps like Calm is immediately obvious upon switching, and the cost to get the premium membership ($59.99/year) is close to the same price as Calm but you get SOOOO much more. I view this price as an investment in myself. I definitely think it’s worth it.

yamswire,2,2021-03-01 14:03:02,PastLove,I’ve had this app since before they turned into a yoga/mindfulness app. Ok but they belittled what was intentionally a nice meditation timer with all tibetan bells and others. Although i paid for one year subscription. i am not happy that there is no contact information That all the icons for setting a time are so tiny it’s ridiculous. i used like when right when my meditation finished it would straight to journal pad where i would write notes And if you want to just use it for meditation only without the cast of characters and film they offer it’s really hard to at the beginning to find your way to go solo.

So I’ve joined “member plus” and enjoy the extra features and functionality — especially the courses, ability to download and rewind, and the fact that 50% of subscription supports the teachers.  Thank you Insight Timer!

Note — a couple of minor glitches to resolve: (1) notifications come in three minutes after the actual start time; (2) sometimes I’m listed as “Anonymous” (instead of my screen name) during a group or live meditation.

2017 review:
This is an update of my previous (early 2017) review for this app - still very positive, while adjusting for the features in the new version released in late 2017:

There is such a wonderful variety of meditations that everyone will find something here.   I like the area called ""popular"" for finding new things like guided meditations for morning, yoga, sleep, metta, etc.  There are ""motivational talks"" too, which I don't usually think of as meditation, but certainly could be helpful for many.  

I also enjoy the curated series ""365 days playlist"" where there is a theme and intro for each week, and then an individual meditation for each day. It is a nice way to learn about different meditation practices and find new things.  Most are 10-15 minutes but a few run longer.   Varies by the day.  

The ""in app purchases"" of extra timer bells and ambient sounds like birds, and flowing water round out the experience nicely.  I like that I can use those timer bells offline.
   
For people with long stretches and/or uneven wifi/data availability you can also pay a small monthly fee that enables you to download the meditations to your device.

To prevent battery drain at night after a sleep meditation, make sure you select sleep mode within that meditation.  (You have to do that on each of your devices because this feature doesn't seem to sync across devices.)  And of course, on Apple devices  you can also turn off location services and background app refresh, and swipe off the timer when not in use to preserve battery life any time.   

The ""social"" features of the app are unobtrusive and adaptable to individual preferences through privacy settings.  At the minimum, seeing the numbers of people around the world meditating at once brings hope and encouragement.  While most of the meditations are in English, many are in other languages (you can filter for this) which makes it very global.

Overall the app is very intuitive. The few times I had questions, the support folks were very prompt and helpful.   I reviewed an earlier version of the app and included a wishlist - and I can tell how attentive and dedicated the developers for this app are because every single one of the suggestions was answered in the new version.

Thank you, Insight timer!",False,insight-timer-meditation-app,337472899,

Chillbizzee,5,2021-02-23 23:19:54,Your best bet for a better life. 💫,"This is the original, the genuine and the broadest. This is the only app I can think of that could save or greatly improve your life. 30 years ago I took a course in Transcendental Meditation, it never stuck. I downloaded IT 2 yrs. ago and before long committed daily for life. I don’t commit to much, so that alone was a breakthrough. 

I know some others apps have attracted big VC money and IPO riches but I have not tried, for researched well and I appreciate this is essentially a non-profit where most proceeds go to contributors. 

It’s had some nice improvements and format changes recently such as to its SLEEP section. It has not made some obvious improvements I sent them. Such as they misuse the word FINNISH at least as American English speakers use it. Bless their hearts but they are either trying to avoid the word END and any perceived negativity or the cynic might guess they mislead to increase their metrics? I continue to mistakenly read it as RESUME. 

In the end I have trust for IT and everyone in the community. There are only beautiful people here seeking better lives and relationships. Give yourself the gift of this app, give it some time and you will come to realize why you are so deserving of this gift and so much more. 🙏🏻

2/2021 Update
IT recently came out with ‘Live’, this is teachers giving their wisdom, running yoga classes, making music, answering questions and leading meditations. The users have an opportunity to say “Hello” and comment which gives a lovely sense of community.
