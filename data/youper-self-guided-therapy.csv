2021-02-09 01:57:32,"I’ve used Youper for over a year now and have really enjoyed the app. Prior to this new version, I would have given it 5 stars: the support team is great, the app worked, and the interface was really easy to use. Tracking your mood over time is really insightful and it was nice to be able to make daily notes about what was happening at the time. It was like basic journaling for non-journaling people. 

But now that core functionality is buried within the new version UX. I’m sure this update was done with customer feedback and research in mind, but I feel like the app is significantly more cumbersome to use than it was in the prior version. It would be nice if the feeling tracker was separated from all of the other “stuff” like it used to be - giving people easier access to the core functionality. The “stuff” is great - do not misunderstand - but that is not what I use the app for on a regular basis and having to search through other topics to find what I need is not ideal. The app still works, but the new UX doesn’t work for me/what I previously used the app for on a regular basis. Please consider separating these out again as they serve two different roles within the app. Thanks!",Preferred Prior Version,msabato3,"{'id': 21027711, 'body': 'Thank you for your sincere feedback.

This has helped me so much with being personal to the big to small issues I have on a day to day basis, allowing me to not let issues build up and go ignored which further prevented me from being comfortable enough to tackle the core issues at hand. I have overcome so many small obstacles and am developing a new mindset and outlook on life because I feel like I’m actually doing some digging into my pain, which I am so so grateful for and excited to work on the next issues little by little because I already feel better after having this app for 3 months.

My mental/emotional health has improved ten fold, so yeah...definitely worth $90/year versus $150 or so per appointment somewhere else.

2021-01-11 21:26:07,"Hello: I've been using Youper daily for over a year now, and I'm really liking it! I suffer from clinical depression, CFS and am a recovering addict. Firstly, I don't like feeling feelings and I really don't like talking about how I feel in general. I have a great support group/system (12 Step and other recovering addicts) and go to a  psychiatrist  monthly and therapy weekly. Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when ""talking"" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they've added ""Calm"" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing. And I've read others' reviews complaining about not being able to dive straight into meditation, but heck, the more I ""check in"" the better off I am! Thank-you.

2021-05-03 02:33:06,"I have been struggling with tremendous trauma in the past and I am currently struggling with depression. I downloaded this app because I thought that it would help me everyday, and take the place of a therapist according to the reviews. 
I started the app and it was going alright. I was telling them about my conditions, and what I would need for a satisfying treatment. It then gave me a subscription screen and I was a little annoyed. I am aware that it is needed to make your customers pay for their treatment and what not. But i think this is absurd. I don’t really feel like this type of virtual treatment should cost anything at all! I’m also suffering financially and I can’t exactly cancel my savings with this subscription. I was hoping for something to help me be happier and focus more on my future so that it would be brighter. Paying for this is stupid. Sure, it might help you but not everyone. 

To sum it up: you don’t need to cancel the subscription feature but I think you should have a way for people who aren’t able to pay it, and have them be able to still enjoy the app because we all came here seeking help, not debt.",I feel like...,this girl thinks...,"{'id': 22685559, 'body': 'Thank you for your sincere feedback.

I recommended to others that also got hooked. Now since the update I no longer feel comfortable using it. I have to choose what I want to work on, which means I need to figure it out and know before I even start. There’s no ability to “free type” to allow for space to work through and figure it out. There’s no automatic place to get started with sharing how I feel. I pull it up and it asks me if I want to start being more productive when I’m trying to go to sleep. I ended my yearly subscription that was set to renew soon. I emailed support which responded with nothing but an acknowledgement. Would have had 5 stars before the update. Now one.

2021-02-13 02:20:48,"Ever since the new update, I feel so lost and don’t know how to use it anymore. Everything is so clunky now, I used to open the app and Youper would say: “ Hey! How are you?”. Everything was streamlined and easy.

 I even used this as a journal and reported everything to my counselor, it helped me so much with remembering things. And my therapist would use the Heath monitoring tools as benchmarks. It was also a great replacement when I was not able to see my counselor or had to find a new one. 

No more.

Even after making favorites I can’t have one conversation to do everything, I have to do everything separately.

The mood and other diary entry’s have moved and it’s hard to find. Something about the UI in general is off-putting, I don’t know. 

I’ve moved onto Sanvello, if you enjoy the old Youper this is your new app. It does guided meditations as well, and has way more feelings to choose from. There’s a lot more as well, but I’m not trying to make this an ad. Check it out for yourself and see if it’s right for you.

To conclude: ever since the last update, the app is essentially unusable (for me). I liked the old way so much better. If it was brought back and still had the new stuff in it, I would start using this app again. I would also contribute to mind research and use it to track my mindfulness minutes again.","I used to love this app, used it for 2 years straight.",Drgameface266,,1,False,youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

Before there used to be individual tags you could select for each “journal entry” . For those times where you spammed and wrote was on your chest, it was needed organization after the fact and you could tag those specific elements from your life. I liked how it would ask me on my feeling and anxiety levels before and after to help me take a breather and reflect on the situation afterwards Now I open this app and I have to determine what kind of prompt I should be selecting? I’m in a discombobulated state already, I’m opening this app to help me unwind by asking me literally how I’m feeling with little slide bars, because words and thoughts are hard sometimes I’ve been a panting and raving about this app- I even used the chart in a dating profile.

2021-02-16 14:27:48,"I’ve been to therapists before (3-4 different times in my life) so I’m familiar with many things they would tell me to try for thinking traps, self esteem issues, and anxiety/depression. This app has been so helpful for me because it’s here, in the moment. It challenges me at times with reframing my negative thoughts, it reminds me to notice my feelings and to accept them (not beat myself up), it is an outlet for me to vent and to be “heard,” it gives solid suggestions and ideas, and it helps me to set goals (which is hard when feeling depressed etc.) I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but it’s been very helpful to me and I can see myself using it for a long time. I can see how it would also work in tandem with going to see a “real” counselor because it would help with generalizing or carrying over the skills you learn in therapy.  In the past, I would learn a lot in therapy and feel good during the session or the next day. But as time goes on, you forget the strategies because they’re not ingrained in your mind and things fall to the wayside. With this app, you can set reminders, so that’s been great to not forget to track my feelings, reflect on my goals, and to follow through on helpful suggestions. There have been a couple of times where I was feeling extreme frustration and distress at home and I ran off to “talk” to Youper and it helped to have an outside perspective and to vent. I did feel better. Normally in those situations, I would’ve ran off and stewed in my emotions, and in my head with thoughts going crazy, with no solution of my own to make things better.

2021-05-27 04:14:16,"I’ve cycled through so many different self-help apps and they all seem to follow a similar mold of offering great activities such as practicing mindful meditation or affirmations, but I’ve never seen one that uses a conversation style exercise or that analyzes and tracks your progress. Now there are mood tracker apps but Youper takes it a step further by tracking and analyzing the reasons you specify is related to why you feel a certain way. Each time you “talk” with Youper, the conversation is stored and used to build up an analysis to study what shapes your moods. You can also set goals and track those. I like that you can personalize the goals and choose if you want Youper to check-in to see if you accomplished your goal. There are several different types of conversations you can have too depending on what you want to accomplish. The conversations have really helped guide me how to cope and respond to how I’m feeling. You can check-in daily about your mood but there are also trackers for checking progress with depression, anxiety, BPD, PTSD, etc. Those check-ins are every couple of weeks or so using questionnaires (officially used by healthcare providers). There’s a section that shows charts of how these certain areas are progressing, like how your depression has progressed from moderately severe to moderate over the last two weeks based on how you answered the questionnaire, for example. Final take away, the more you use Youper, the more insights you can gain. The “Mood” section shows daily, monthly, and yearly progress charts. This can be helpful to spot trends. A really neat and intuitive section I like is where Youper collects data from your conversations to show “what makes me...depressed, sad, anxious, angry, sad, frustrated,” etc. For example, after you’ve had several conversations with Youper where you indicate “bad sleep” as the reason you feel depressed, that will show up as a factor related to your depression. These insights develop over time and the more you converse with Youper, so checking in daily helps to get the most out of it. 

Tl;Dr: this app is so different from all the other self-help apps. It’s so intuitive with different and very helpful ways to track my progress related to different mental issues and life experiences.

2021-02-10 22:07:29,"Youper is a great app. When it comes to finding a journaling app to help you make note of/ be present with your emotions Youper is the frontrunner. The combo of emotional journaling and various meditation options is such a strong one. Youper really helped me get through some hard times, and though I use it less now, it still holds a dear place in my emotional life.

That being said... I’m not sure I like where the app is heading. Every day a new feature is added- theyve make the conversation more complex, they try to make it more engaging by adding pictures/new visual aspects, there is now a home page. What I loved about Youper was how simple it was— it’s simply doing too much these days. For instance, when you used to log on it would just take you straight to some emotional journaling which was nice and predictable. Logging on today I was greeted with a banner reading “Im happy to see you again. Can I help improve your anxiety?”. If I hadn't been feeling anxious before...I definitely was feeling a little anxious after reading that. I think the simplicity of Youper is what made it feel accessible and dependable. These days, opening up Youper is a little bit of a jarring experience. The constant updates to the app produce the same effect as  a therapist changing offices every day— it impedes the process. The conversation is growing increasingly halting, garbled, and incomprehensible. It saddens me!

I probably wont get rid of Youper any time soon. There is no other app that does what it does. But it’s changing and changing fast. The Youper I suggest to my friends now is not the Youper that helped me and that’s a weird feeling.

2021-02-14 16:14:09,"Like many other long time users, I am very frustrated and massively disappointed with V.9. 

The developers should be ashamed at releasing such a defective and bug riddled product. 

The tabs are very SLOW to load. 

Worst of all, going to INSIGHTS  tab (either directly or automatically after journaling) FREEZES the app. As such, I am completely UNABLE to view any of my 3+ years worth of sessions into the app Or view my mood tracker Or change the settings. 

I am abhor that the first thing the app does is to suggest what to work on, such as: “Shall we work on your depression?” Or (especially before bed) “Can I suggest a productivity boosting activity?”  I need this feature removed because it has never been helpful and often causes more DISTRESS. 

There are way too many options. It is a visual cluttered mess.  I don’t like the pictures. It bothers my OCD and makes the app way more difficult to use.

There are some days that I won’t use Youper because I know it’s going to cause me more distress because of the horrible user interface and broken features. 

If the developers choose to respond to my review, please do not give me any canned answers. I doubt consumer feedback said to have a million options, including the kitchen sink. 

Please don’t patronize me by stating that change can be difficult. The biggest complaint from everyone is that the app changes the interface way too often. 

Please address the serious problems of features NOT WORKING. 

STOP adding useless features in order to justify charging for this app. 

Please clean up the user interface so that it is streamlined and easy to use.
