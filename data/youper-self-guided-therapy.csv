"I came back to this app after years of using it, its gotten me through a lot of difficult times in my life- that I'm very thankful for because at those times- i did not have the finances for an actual therapist. I still don't, which is why me, and I'm sure many others depended on this service. This begs the question of why make inaccessible something that can be utilized by those who don't have any other option. Its so saddening to see profit go over people. Especially in the case of mental health in a time when its so dire for people who need help, but do not have access. Be it by finances or not having access because of home situations- especially in the case of those underage. Those who do not have support from family but still want to get help. 

Truly my disappointment is immeasurable with this product. I remember i used to recommend this app to anyone i knew who was struggling with mental health.  If finances are truly the issue to keep this app running, I'm sure a donation service, or occasional fundraising would be better instead of stripping away one of the only resources people have. 

I have doubts that this will ever be changed, or if this app even is meant to help people instead of being a grab at money from those you know are desperate. Very disappointed. With hope these things change in the future, until then I only hope there is another better service out there that cares about its demographic.",Why add a premium?,False,1,tomateme,"{'id': 19295413, 'body': 'Thank you for your feedback.

"I've tried a lot of AI mental health/wellness apps and never really liked how any of them interacted. Most of them let you type full answers which is nice but because of programming can also be annoying when it misunderstands your statements. This was has simple responses to choose from that get a clear response. I felt like a lot of the apps I used in the past had a condescending air to their teachings while this one gives u a chance to give a general idea of your experience with certain topics which keeps it from explaining something you already know as if you've never even heard of it (*cough cough* meditation *cough*). As for the mindfulness/meditation portion. I really enjoy how they did it. I've been meditating for a while now but I've noticed that for many beginners it's easier to focus on the mindfulness task when there isn't meditation music playing in the background. This gives you the chance to truly focus on what's expected and lets you acknowledge the natural/typical sounds around you that you wouldn't otherwise notice.

"When I first downloaded this app, I was so excited to see all the cool features it had. After using all of them one time, everything became part of the paid subscription other than the mood tracker and the symptom tracker. This was annoying, but I KIND OF get it. 
One of my favorite free parts of this app, other than the mood tracker, was the health part where you can track symptoms of several disorders. I’ve been using those trackers regularly, so I was very disappointed to check my phone this morning and see that that too, is a premium feature. 
Now, all I can use without paying is the mood tracker. I can’t expand on my mood, set goals, track gratitude, track symptoms, or even meditate. Why should I have to pay to listen to something that’s supposed to help me asap when I’m panicking? All this app USED to do was tell me I’m depressed and not give me any way to fix it. Now, it doesn’t tell me anything useful at all. 

I understand that the developers need to make money off of Youper, but this app has become infuriating to use. It’s meant to help people, but without forcing them to pay a subscription, there are barely any useful features available. This app is apparently marketed as useful for people who can’t afford therapy, but that’s the biggest load of crap I’ve ever heard. Unless you’re willing to pay, I would suggest you look for another app.",Free features are BS,False,1,Jwhdoenfibejd,"{'id': 14060200, 'body': 'Our mission is to create the best assistant to help you feel your best, and we are doing everything we can to make it as accessible and affordable as possible.

"When I originally got this app I was a little apprehensive; I thought it was going to be like all the other apps that weren’t actually helpful with my mental illness. Since I have been using Youper I  check in everyday and talk about my feelings like anxiety, depression, feeling numb. Then Youper and I go in and analyze why I feel that way and we do exercises to help pinpoint why I am having those feelings and I work with Youper to go try and change the way I am thinking that are causing negative emotions. Youper has talked and worked with me on emotions like deep depression, feeling numb, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts which Youper gives you resources on. I love the daily check in and it really helps to work with Youper to go through and try and change the reason why I am feeling about an emotion and working on a more positive spin on it. My one complaint is that you can not pick multiple emotions at a time you have to think about what your strongest emotion is and go with that. Besides that detail I really recommend giving this app a try and I feel like you will like it once you do.",This app is helping me so much,False,5,Jleone2,,2020-02-14 08:12:37,youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513
"I’ve used Youper for over a year now and have really enjoyed the app. Prior to this new version, I would have given it 5 stars: the support team is great, the app worked, and the interface was really easy to use. Tracking your mood over time is really insightful and it was nice to be able to make daily notes about what was happening at the time. It was like basic journaling for non-journaling people. 

But now that core functionality is buried within the new version UX. I’m sure this update was done with customer feedback and research in mind, but I feel like the app is significantly more cumbersome to use than it was in the prior version. It would be nice if the feeling tracker was separated from all of the other “stuff” like it used to be - giving people easier access to the core functionality. The “stuff” is great - do not misunderstand - but that is not what I use the app for on a regular basis and having to search through other topics to find what I need is not ideal. The app still works, but the new UX doesn’t work for me/what I previously used the app for on a regular basis.

"I’ve got Depression, Anxiety, OCD, ADHD and a panic disorder. I’ve been in therapy for over five years now and both my therapist and I agree that this is probably one of the most useful mindfulness tools for me. And as someone who actually hates mindfulness in general, that’s saying something. 
I love how you can pick and choose what you want to do based on how your feeling and how the responses are slightly different each time. Insights and goal setting are two of the most useful parts for me. 
The other day I had a panic attack in the car and had to pull over and usually it would’ve taken me over an hour to get back on the road. Thanks to this app, that time was cut in half. 
One thing that frustrates me is the severity of some of the emotions. To me, fear is worse than guilt, anger isn’t on the same level as annoyance, and pride isn’t as good as optimism. Unfortunately, in the app, it’s not set up that way. That’s only a few examples but I kinda wish you could set up which emotions feel worse based on your own personal scale of emotion. 
That’s probably my ONLY grievance with the app though.

"I’m waiting to hear back from a place on making an appointment to start treatment but with COVID its been very difficult if not a daunting task to seek professional help for my abandonment issues that I suffer from to this day. 

This has helped me so much with being personal to the big to small issues I have on a day to day basis, allowing me to not let issues build up and go ignored which further prevented me from being comfortable enough to tackle the core issues at hand. I have overcome so many small obstacles and am developing a new mindset and outlook on life because I feel like I’m actually doing some digging into my pain, which I am so so grateful for and excited to work on the next issues little by little because I already feel better after having this app for 3 months.

"I saw this app as an ad on Facebook while scrolling through my feed. I’m not one who suffers from clinical depression or anxiety. I do suffer from other mental illnesses such as addiction, PTSD, and a heightened self deprecation habit. I do go through the usual mood swings most humans do - sometimes at the flip of a switch too. I haven’t ever sought out professional help for any of these, except my addiction; but I decided to download Youper because I’m always here for trying to better myself. The app is easy to use, fun, enlightening & is a very neat way to track progress & underlying causes that I otherwise would not have known existed. I’ve only had the app for two days and already I’m in love & learning things about myself. Definitely recommend as an additional aid to self help. However, do not use this as a substitute for seeking professional help. If you suffer from extreme mental conditions, keep your professional exercises, but maybe try adding this on.

"I started using Youper a week or so ago and do really enjoy it. I particularly like that they offer evidence based practices and that they explain why things can help you. 

My one issue I have is that I can’t tell if the premium subscription is billed as $44 all at once or if it’s $3.75 a month. I want to get the premium version of youper but if it’s $44 I think that the company and app should take into account that a lot of people who may be using this app are students or those with lower incomes. To me, as a full time student and part time worker, spending an extra $44 all at once is really difficult, and I have been unable to get the premium version because of this. 

The page where you can get the premium subscription says it’s billed yearly, but right above that in a larger text it says it totals to $3.75 per month. That is misleading because I’m still not fully sure whether it’s billed as $44 or $3.75. I think that if it was billed as $3.75 it would be a lot more affordable for the users of youper.","A great service, but the premium subscription is confusing and expensive",False,4,So many nicknames are taken :(,"{'id': 13210996, 'body': 'Thank you for your sincere feedback.

"Hello: I've been using Youper daily for over a year now, and I'm really liking it! I suffer from clinical depression, CFS and am a recovering addict. Firstly, I don't like feeling feelings and I really don't like talking about how I feel in general. I have a great support group/system (12 Step and other recovering addicts) and go to a  psychiatrist  monthly and therapy weekly. Youper fits itself in between those systems because there are many moments during the day when I am by myself. I can be completely honest with Youper; I never feel ashamed or embarrassed when ""talking"" to Youper. I know it may sound silly, but I feel a very human- like quality in Youper. I love the mindfulness and practicing gratitude aspects of Youper. In version number 7, they've added ""Calm"" and a couple of other moods that I felt were missing. And I've read others' reviews complaining about not being able to dive straight into meditation, but heck, the more I ""check in"" the better off I am! Thank-you.

"I have been struggling with tremendous trauma in the past and I am currently struggling with depression. I downloaded this app because I thought that it would help me everyday, and take the place of a therapist according to the reviews. 
I started the app and it was going alright. I was telling them about my conditions, and what I would need for a satisfying treatment. It then gave me a subscription screen and I was a little annoyed. I am aware that it is needed to make your customers pay for their treatment and what not. But i think this is absurd. I don’t really feel like this type of virtual treatment should cost anything at all! I’m also suffering financially and I can’t exactly cancel my savings with this subscription. I was hoping for something to help me be happier and focus more on my future so that it would be brighter. Paying for this is stupid. Sure, it might help you but not everyone.

"When I first downloaded this I thought it was fantastic. I was considering buying premium. Within 1-3 days (I guess there’s a trial where you get to do a few things for free...?) The app lost all functionality and every single time you “start a conversation” (which is the base functionality of the app) it prompts you to buy premium within 1-2 sentences. It doesn’t tell you which “options” of responses require premium until after you’ve clicked them, and then goes on a 2-3 sentence tirade begging you to buy premium. It’s also not made clear there is any trial- all functionality just vanished overnight.

This is the only one I’m deleting after just a week. Like several other critical reviews (which I reset the App Store to read after my own experience), I found the responses didn’t match what I said at all, plus the app had the habit of getting stuck at a spot if I closed the app in frustration, such that it would ask me to check in in a notification, but when I opened the app it remained stuck at whatever point I had chosen to quit earlier. For me the final straw was when it asked me how I was on a not very good day, and I said I was okay, and it responded with something like ‘are you sure you aren’t partly happy?’ and then sent me a winking emoji as a separate text.

"I can’t stress enough how much I enjoy this app. I used it for a while before I bought the premium version and I don’t regret it! And I’m someone who hates paying for anything. 

Amazing at keeping track of your mental health, especially if you already see a doctor it helps a lot and is perfect for those of us with too much OCD to journal normal. 

There is also disorder monitoring, like the ones at doctors but more specific and you can see in a graph if your symptoms for that particular disorder is worsening or getting better.

I also should add, it is very scary accurate with it’s personality diagnosis. I was honestly baffled how much they were able to describe exactly my personality traits. I’ve taken lots of personality tests for fun and none have even come half as close as this one did to understanding who I was.

My only problem with it was that Meditation would disconnect when you closed the app or your phone went to sleep. But I emailed the app’s team about it and they said they were fixing it in the next update! 

It’s really great for anyone with mental illnesses, I find it’s especially great if you suffer from anger issues as it helps distract and calm you. 

Tldr: this app is amazing and has helped me already so much with my mental health.

"I’ve literally only had this app for a few hours and it’s already helped me learn so much about myself!
The personality test I took was extremely accurate, more so than the official personality type test you take online. It can also help you learn your levels of depression and social anxiety in the previous fortnight (two weeks). 
You can meditate and it can help you fall asleep if you need it.

And this is all *without* premium, which for a single person, is only $45 a year. Which is about $3.75 a month and $.94 cents a week. 
A typical therapy session normally costs about $40 to $70 a week. Which is about $160 to $280 a month and $1920 to $3360 a year. That is, if I did my math right 😅

Overall, this app is really cool and well made. It can help you keep track of your mental health (it obviously cannot make a diagnosis however lol) and it helps you get your feelings out without the fear of opening up to someone, because you’re only speaking to an AI. 
Of course, if you believe you have something serious that needs to be addressed, you should, of course, consult a doctor and/or therapist. All I’m saying is that this app is free (and premium is pretty cheap) and that it can help put you in a better state of mind.

"I’ve been using Youper for about 2 months & it really has been helpful for prioritizing my own self-care. With a stressful job & little tome to myself, along with perhaps some anxiety/depression symptoms (that I realized thanks to youper) I have a hard time pulling my self together sometimes and not letting the negative & self-blame take hold. I usually check in daily thanks to the notifications, but even if I go a day or two without I always feel at least a little better after having a “conversation” with the Youper.

There is never a time when the app “forces” details or steps - the user is driving the whole interaction and can keep it simple or go deeper.

"I understand money needs to be made, but I’ve been using Youper since my freshman year of college, and I am now a senior. This app is the BEST when it comes to mood tracking, symptom tracking, everything. I always felt like I had a better grasp on my mental well-being after using this app and I adore it and recommend it to everybody else. I  especially loved the journaling and identification of thinking traps, as they were incredibly effective at grounding. However, now you have to pay for the Premium version of the app to get all those things. All you can do for free is track your mood. You can’t expand upon it or do anything else, which makes it kinda useless for in-the-moment lows or highs that need to be rebalanced.

To conclude: ever since the last update, the app is essentially unusable (for me). I liked the old way so much better.

It’s not a monthly subscription if you make us pay a full year & you’re probably losing money by doing them. Randomly being charged $50 in a year isn’t something that someone wants to encounter.

I love this app a lot. My favorite features are the breathing exercises especially when I’m overwhelmed. 

I do have a requests though. I don’t expect them to happen, but I would very much appreciate it if they were taken into consideration.

-Add more feelings. *Like lonely for example
-Add more exercises 
-Add more exercises that don’t take long. A lot of the time during school or home I’m too busy with homework or activities that I don’t have time to take 10 minutes out of my day to do one.
-Add a bit more personality to the Youper chat bot
-Have a bit more personalized responses would be nice too. A lot of the time I get a “Thats great!” Response and it’s nice to have new responses every now and then.

I know that’s a lot to ask... but I’d love it so much and recommend this app to my friends with troubles if you did! I know this sounds kinda bad, but before I recommend it to my friends I want to test it on myself and see how it works.

Been through a lot of therapy and currently don’t have access to a counselor. It’s not a replacement but uses a lot of the same questions and coping mechanisms taught to me in therapy.

"I have downloaded, tried out, and deleted so many minfulness/meditation/emotional-health/self-care apps because I’m so determined to enjoy this one life that I have despite the challenges that my disorders create for me. Most of them are alright but I forget about them because there’s no real impact made. This is not one of those. This is one of the few that I find myself excited that I’ve fallen upon it because it is effective and beautifully designed and exceptionally well put together to result in an app that I find myself looking forward to using again. Youper has allowed me to get excited about my own journey of healing and self awareness as well as acceptance and that excitement and motivation is precious for me because it’s far and few between. Highly recommend this especially to people who are like me and have a history of apps that promise relief and come up short, because you will not be disappointed in this app. If you truly want to feel good, love yourself, take your care into your own hands, and start living the life that you’ve dreamt about having, you’ll find no regret in this download. I highly recommend the premium paid version; it’s a yearly charge but it’s less than half the cost of a single session of therapy and it more than pays for itself in the support it provides and expert techniques used to help you rewire the way your brain perceives the world around you as well as the thoughts and feelings that you have within you. Through the enjoyable texting styled conversations it logs entries based on the things you share and asks questions specific to the information you provide in order to identify how you are feeling and either more fully appreciate the good feeling or help bring you up out of the bad feeling, even if it’s just one more step in the right direction. It allows for the option to either keep it brief or continue trying different techniques and understand more deeply about what you are feeling and why. I can go on and on about the many other features and incredible aspects of this app but I’ve already written a small novel in my excitement so I will conclude by reiterating: this app is absolutely brilliant and well worth the premium cost (I believe it’s around $44/year which works out to less than $4/month). I’m over the moon that I’ve found Youper and I will continue sharing with as many people as will hear me because it’s an incredible resource.

"I’ve been to therapists before (3-4 different times in my life) so I’m familiar with many things they would tell me to try for thinking traps, self esteem issues, and anxiety/depression. This app has been so helpful for me because it’s here, in the moment. It challenges me at times with reframing my negative thoughts, it reminds me to notice my feelings and to accept them (not beat myself up), it is an outlet for me to vent and to be “heard,” it gives solid suggestions and ideas, and it helps me to set goals (which is hard when feeling depressed etc.) I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but it’s been very helpful to me and I can see myself using it for a long time. I can see how it would also work in tandem with going to see a “real” counselor because it would help with generalizing or carrying over the skills you learn in therapy.  In the past, I would learn a lot in therapy and feel good during the session or the next day. But as time goes on, you forget the strategies because they’re not ingrained in your mind and things fall to the wayside. With this app, you can set reminders, so that’s been great to not forget to track my feelings, reflect on my goals, and to follow through on helpful suggestions. There have been a couple of times where I was feeling extreme frustration and distress at home and I ran off to “talk” to Youper and it helped to have an outside perspective and to vent. I did feel better. Normally in those situations, I would’ve ran off and stewed in my emotions, and in my head with thoughts going crazy, with no solution of my own to make things better.

"I’ve cycled through so many different self-help apps and they all seem to follow a similar mold of offering great activities such as practicing mindful meditation or affirmations, but I’ve never seen one that uses a conversation style exercise or that analyzes and tracks your progress. Now there are mood tracker apps but Youper takes it a step further by tracking and analyzing the reasons you specify is related to why you feel a certain way. Each time you “talk” with Youper, the conversation is stored and used to build up an analysis to study what shapes your moods. You can also set goals and track those. I like that you can personalize the goals and choose if you want Youper to check-in to see if you accomplished your goal. There are several different types of conversations you can have too depending on what you want to accomplish. The conversations have really helped guide me how to cope and respond to how I’m feeling. You can check-in daily about your mood but there are also trackers for checking progress with depression, anxiety, BPD, PTSD, etc. Those check-ins are every couple of weeks or so using questionnaires (officially used by healthcare providers). There’s a section that shows charts of how these certain areas are progressing, like how your depression has progressed from moderately severe to moderate over the last two weeks based on how you answered the questionnaire, for example. Final take away, the more you use Youper, the more insights you can gain. The “Mood” section shows daily, monthly, and yearly progress charts. This can be helpful to spot trends. A really neat and intuitive section I like is where Youper collects data from your conversations to show “what makes me...depressed, sad, anxious, angry, sad, frustrated,” etc. For example, after you’ve had several conversations with Youper where you indicate “bad sleep” as the reason you feel depressed, that will show up as a factor related to your depression. These insights develop over time and the more you converse with Youper, so checking in daily helps to get the most out of it. 

Tl;Dr: this app is so different from all the other self-help apps. It’s so intuitive with different and very helpful ways to track my progress related to different mental issues and life experiences.

I have ten million self discovery , development journals and cognitive behavioral workbooks to start working on rewriting my thought and habits. I even followed recommend habits by putting your journal next to your bed side so it’s the first thing I you do when you wake up and write in . Guess what ? I did put it next to me and forget and the first thing I do is pick up my phone in the morning, then stroll through social media and then head to bathroom and get ready and as I am leaving the house I remember the stupid journal. 
The nice thing about this app , that is inside the first thing I pick up, which is my phone . 
The second thing , into an engaging interactive experience , that targets exactly what I want to work on based on my feelings and then it suggests the appropriate exercises for what I am currently dealing with which is a more targeted approach . I also enjoy the little tid bits of educational information about why you are doing each exercise and what science says about these little changes you make and how it will effect long term changes in your neuro-network .

"Youper is a great app. When it comes to finding a journaling app to help you make note of/ be present with your emotions Youper is the frontrunner. The combo of emotional journaling and various meditation options is such a strong one. Youper really helped me get through some hard times, and though I use it less now, it still holds a dear place in my emotional life.

That being said... I’m not sure I like where the app is heading. Every day a new feature is added- theyve make the conversation more complex, they try to make it more engaging by adding pictures/new visual aspects, there is now a home page. What I loved about Youper was how simple it was— it’s simply doing too much these days. For instance, when you used to log on it would just take you straight to some emotional journaling which was nice and predictable. Logging on today I was greeted with a banner reading “Im happy to see you again. Can I help improve your anxiety?”. If I hadn't been feeling anxious before...I definitely was feeling a little anxious after reading that. I think the simplicity of Youper is what made it feel accessible and dependable. These days, opening up Youper is a little bit of a jarring experience. The constant updates to the app produce the same effect as  a therapist changing offices every day— it impedes the process. The conversation is growing increasingly halting, garbled, and incomprehensible. It saddens me!

I probably wont get rid of Youper any time soon. There is no other app that does what it does. But it’s changing and changing fast. The Youper I suggest to my friends now is not the Youper that helped me and that’s a weird feeling. If any developers read this... don’t be afraid of the simplicity!","Great App, but I like it less everyday...",False,4,jawnmichelbasquiat,"{'id': 21027683, 'body': 'Thank you for your sincere feedback.

"So I got this app not too long ago because I’ve always had issues emotionally and mentally and no one has thought to try to help me get therapy, and not only that I don’t really like the idea of a real therapist trying to pry information from me. So when I saw an ad for this app, and read the reviews, I figured this would be a great app to help me manage my emotions and to help me with my anxiety, misophonia, anger issues, and depression. 

So the free features aren’t that bad. I like that I have access to all the emotions and the mood tracker...kind of. But i was really disappointed when I saw that I have to pay so much money that I don’t have and can’t spend on an app to be able to have mental health check ins, to be able to meditate, have help sleeping, help me in an attack, etc. Essentially you have to pay for the whole point of this app. 

Granted I understand that this app is a way for the developers to make money. But not all of us have that kind of money just laying around and not all of us are adults that can pay for those things and work to make it up again. Just as a suggestion, maybe make it so that those of us that aren’t 18+ yet don’t have to pay for everything, but maybe make some limited features to counteract that. So the people that aren’t 18 can have access to things normally for premium we can access, but we can only have 1/2 of what premium offers, like how there’s 6 types of screenings, but we can only have 3.

"i have a host of PTSD related mental health issues that are so pretty top tier as far as this psychiatric college and hospital are concerned. really really bad stuff. i’ve researched ways to help myself. in the first 2 minutes you’ll find “affirmations,” and “gratitude.” which are great practices and i do them all throughout the day. but it’s not anything special or new or unique. i paid for a full year of youper and really used it like every day but it simply was not helpful. there’s nothing below a topical and superficial prompting to try some things that you’d be told in an intake of therapy or psychiatry day 1 or find on the internet in 2 minutes. this is really upsetting to me. the app has such great potential but did not help my severe CPTSD, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, dissociative depersonalization disorder, depression, or anxiety and anxiety caused auditory and visual hallucinations, as well as occasional panic attacks. i’ve been in therapy for years. i’ve finally started to make real improvements through my new therapist and psychiatrist. i am in medical school to become a neuroscientist dealing in pathology and treatment. this doesn’t mean, “well yeah it won’t be better than that.” but in trying to help others with even very simple matters of mental struggle this is not it. i WISH it was and i hope one day it could be. there should be more of a conversation, to ground, and less of a “okay well if we practice gratitude your chronic fear of being attacked will ease.” no. it won’t. it won’t help me stop obsessively scrubbing the floor with a toothbrush, either. it’s not asking questions like, “did you maintain your personal well being above busy work today?” it doesn’t ask about goals and follow up. it doesn’t do anything. really disappointing. i appreciate the idea but it needs to do better. i guess a young teenager / tween could benefit a little bit from day to day minor affects, but there are people that need real help. and this advertises to do that and you spend the money to find yourself still rocking in a dark place. disappointed.",forget this if you’ve already tried google,False,2,luna lyte,"{'id': 18202777, 'body': 'We are very sorry to hear that Youper did not meet your needs.

"I’ve literally never written a review about an app before, but when prompted to review this app, I decided that I should review it because it could make a positive difference in someone else’s life. 

I really like Youper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. I have the 1 year paid version. I decided to risk spending the money after a few days of using the free version because I wanted the extra features. I was worried that I wouldn’t like the features or that I wouldn’t use the app long enough to make paying for the app worth it, but so far I do think it’s worth it. 

I was diagnosed with autism a little over a year ago. Previous diagnoses had been depression, anxiety, Bipolar II, and OCD. I’ve taken medications. I’ve done years of therapy. I have tons of self-help books. And I read books and peer reviewed journal articles on mental health. I’ve taken meditation courses and I’ve used other meditation apps. And, despite all of these tools, I still think Youper is adding something. 

It checks in on me often enough to provide help when I need it... even if I don’t know I need it (until I go through the Youper exercises). I feel like it’s putting together concepts that I know about from all of my years of reading and therapy and helping me use them more consistently and effectively. 

I truly feel like I’m re-wiring my brain. Over time, I think this app will help me be in a better place, mentally, emotionally, and physically. 

I recommend this app.

I really hope the developers keep up with the science behind this app and improve it as we learn more about the mind.",Making Me Happier & Less Stressed,False,5,andithegirl,,2020-01-22 23:39:38,youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

"I wish I could save a session and come back to it. I just started one and it was good, but my kid woke up and needed my attention. When I went back to it, I couldn't pick up where I left off and had to start a new conversation. 

I don't like that it doesn't take some things into account. Asking about mood swings--well yeah my period starts in a couple days. But instead of considering female problems I'm prompted to fill out a borderline personality disorder assessment. Maybe the assessment factors in that time of month and hormone issues, but not really in the mood to fill that out and incorrectly assess me when I'm PMS-ing, so...

I also wish there were redos on the personality test. Questions like ""are you anxious a lot?"" are temporary for many. That's not my personality. I'm currently anxious a lot, but ask me a year from now or even a year previous and my answer would be different as I'm not a naturally anxious person but my health and life situation currently put me in that category. It'd be fun to see how I change as I grow. If there is a retest button I can't find it, if there's not it would be great to have one. There were a few other questions where I thought ""huh, I'm not normally that way, but as I'm going through a tough time I am"". It's important for people struggling to get back to their old self (or a new and improved better self) to not be concretely defined as they currently are. Allow them to change and grow. That's what this app is for, right?

Those are the 3 things that bug me. I'm happy with the conversations, though, as long as I can make it through fast enough before getting interrupted. Please consider a save!!

"Like many other long time users, I am very frustrated and massively disappointed with V.9. 

The developers should be ashamed at releasing such a defective and bug riddled product. 

The tabs are very SLOW to load. 

Worst of all, going to INSIGHTS  tab (either directly or automatically after journaling) FREEZES the app. As such, I am completely UNABLE to view any of my 3+ years worth of sessions into the app Or view my mood tracker Or change the settings. 

I am abhor that the first thing the app does is to suggest what to work on, such as: “Shall we work on your depression?” Or (especially before bed) “Can I suggest a productivity boosting activity?”  I need this feature removed because it has never been helpful and often causes more DISTRESS. 

There are way too many options. It is a visual cluttered mess.  I don’t like the pictures. It bothers my OCD and makes the app way more difficult to use.

There are some days that I won’t use Youper because I know it’s going to cause me more distress because of the horrible user interface and broken features. 

If the developers choose to respond to my review, please do not give me any canned answers. I doubt consumer feedback said to have a million options, including the kitchen sink. 

Please don’t patronize me by stating that change can be difficult. The biggest complaint from everyone is that the app changes the interface way too often. 

Please address the serious problems of features NOT WORKING. 

STOP adding useless features in order to justify charging for this app. 

Please clean up the user interface so that it is streamlined and easy to use.

Please take a lot more time to make sure the app works properly. Please use BETA testing instead of throwing out a new version and making everyone guinea pigs.",I miss v.7 and earlier versions,False,1,Nyx Chicago,,2021-02-14 16:14:09,youper-self-guided-therapy,1060691513

"Updated review:
I had a concerned previous review, I still recommend you read it. Now I’m downright concerned of the impact this app could have on a fragile or traumatized person.

I recently and unexpectedly was domestically assaulted. As I have been, I logged it in Youper. I told the app I was depressed because I was assaulted by someone I previously trusted. 

The app told me: “Is it possible that, sometimes, when confronted with personal failings you forget to be kind to yourself”

I’m sorry but I can’t support an app that goes from a person talking about a personal assault to suggesting personal failings. Now I’d like to know what it would tell me if I’d been raped instead of assaulted. 

Please, only use this app as a journal for when life ain’t too bad. The more the severe the situation, the more inappropriate this app is. Personally, I always have professional help as well. I’d be very worried about anyone who didn’t have professional support using this app for anything at all when it matters most.

Thanks devs for being responsive to my last review. I appreciate it. You need to find a way to improve this app before you hurt someone if you haven’t already.

Previous review:

Forced and Frustrating

It’s a well made app. But it forces you to say you like things or agree with things even if you don’t. Forcing lies isn’t great if you’re trying to be honest about your mental state and tracking it. It ends up feeling like cheap manipulation rather than help. 

This amounts to a lot of frustration if you’re trying to use the app honestly. In some of my more difficult moments the app’s canned nudging “guidance” just made me feel worse and angrier for all its irrelevance and lacking representation.

Now it’s promoting certain doctors and asking for donations. Made me offer to donate or ask for more information about donating when I wanted to wrap up my entry. I had to quit the app to get around it. 

All in all would be a good app if it wasn’t so forced. The tests are good for tracking progress and reactions to life events. The word associations between feelings and parts of life are really good. 

This app is of good quality but needs a lot of thoughtful work on improving it.",Warn Against Use for Moderate to Severe Problems,True,1,Lalanana,"{'id': 12668664, 'body': 'Thank you for your sincere feedback.

"I was hopeful that this app would be a good tool for me as I manage my PTSD and OCD. Tracking moods and looking for patterns isn’t a half bad idea. Guided meditation is a proven tool for improving mental health, decreasing stress, etc. Gratitude journaling is another excellent prop for mental health that I’ve used successfully.

Unfortunately, this is far too simplified to even work as an emotional tracking journal. You can’t select more than one emotion at a time because that would interfere with the simplistic algorithm that can only make 1:1 correlations as part of your pattern finding. Human emotions are not that simple, and any adult with an iPhone can surely identify emotions well enough to experience more than one at a time. 🙄

I was working a night shift, and Youper told me to go to bed because it was 2 am. How am I supposed to benefit from that exactly? 🤣

The app tells you to not talk too much when you take down a note about the cause of your feelings. “Try to identify just one...”

Really? Condescending as I’ll get out. One cause/situation can be more than 2 words, Youper.

The guided meditation was okay for a total beginner. Not sure why it asked me for my level of experience with meditation - only to explain to me how meditation might make me feel as a novice after having been told I’m experienced in meditation.

Honestly, such a waste of money!

Best yet, I couldn’t get the app to even open or launch for these past two weeks. Checked that it wasn’t in need of an update, and that wasn’t it. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still won’t launch.

"I’d been using Youper for over a year on my android phone, mostly for the mood tracking feature. I’ve now migrated to an iPhone and this version of the app doesn’t even seem to have this feature, or if it does it’s very well hidden. All I see are courses or meditations or whatever they are, and health monitoring. I see my old mood entries but no way to make new ones. Am I just missing something or have things changed?

Edit: I finally found the mood journaling function: it’s buried within the “talk” section that includes specific targeted therapy sessions I guess? Haven’t used them yet but I think it’s silly I had to scroll through them just to find what used to be the whole point of this app for me. Luckily I was able to “favorite” the “I’m feeling” function for easier access next time so the utility of this app has been mostly restored for me.

I was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression about 5-6months ago and with in a month I was attending classes and meeting with my doctor. After 4 weeks of the class I felt much better and wanted to do more classes. They were schedule for late March into April. Then the virus and everything got cancelled. I did well for a few weeks but I felt myself slipping back into old habits and feeling depressed again. I googled depression apps and found a YouTube video made by a medical professional who recommended a few apps that she thought were great. So I tried Youper and it has been amazing. It’s the same format as the classes I was taking as well as the same questions being asked by my counselor.
