I wanted to start meditating to calm my nerves and reactions so I downloaded this to try. I fell in love with it from the first day. I listened almost everyday as soon as I woke up. It made me feel so much better. Guided me on how to meditate bc I was a newby and had no idea what I was doing.  This app made me look inside myself and calmly deal with my internal problems as well as calmed my reactions to things and my complete outlook on life really. I was happier and calmer. I lived in the moment instead of worrying. But, I stopped listening when my soon to be ex cut my phone off and I had to get a new phone. I was just dealing with all of that drama, my kids and the holidays it was awful. I‚Äôve had a rough week or so and I needed something to calm my nerves and make me focus. Then I remembered this app and immediately downloaded it. I have listened this morning and already feel a bit calmer. I have missed this app and when the 14 day free trial is up I am going to pay the $89.99/yr subscription fee Bc I can not go without this app again. I need it in my life on a daily basis. Period.
