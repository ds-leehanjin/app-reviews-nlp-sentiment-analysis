2020-02-05 04:28:37,Amazing App,False,5,"Let start by saying this, I don‚Äôt normally leave reviews on apps because I don‚Äôt care enough. This app is one of few I find very deserving! I just downloaded the app about an hour ago. The first thing after you download the app is hit with a membership upgrade. No biggie, close it out and continue being curious. There is a really good selection of unlocked sounds and such to listen to from each category. I found one I thought would be great it‚Äôs something along the lines of ‚Äúby the beach‚Äù or something around that title- and I began to play it. No downloading no wait time boom it‚Äôs playing. I was skeptical of the app at first because I need something I can turn my phone on sleep mode with my alarm set for work in the morning. Not a problem! I hit the power button on my iPhone to put it to sleep and it kept playing! Not only that but don‚Äôt want to turn down the volume so you know you‚Äôll hear your alarm go off? No problem! The app actually has its own volume for whatever you‚Äôre listening to so it won‚Äôt interfere with your alarm or be blaring too loud while trying to research something on the internet in the meantime. Very good app!!! Thanks!",Underdog6779,breethe-meditation-sleep,920161006,
2020-03-13 04:15:58,An amazing safe space,False,5,"I questioned getting this app due to the price, but I‚Äôve been loving it. I have a great sense of appreciation for it. I use it daily, and I‚Äôve liked how the daily meditations offered felt like the universe or God speaking to me because I needed them basically right when I would listen in. This app has many wonderful meditations, talks, short relaxing videos, & nature sounds. I also love the bedtime stories, & sometimes would really try to stay awake to hear all of the storyüòÜ or I would listen in when I needed a nap or to rest during the day. I highly recommend this app. It has helped me through my anxiety, stress, & headaches. Meditation has really helped me so much, & I think it‚Äôs something so useful for everyone to try. Just listening to Lynne Goldberg or just hearing the app‚Äôs automatic music soothes me. The app allows for easy searching & browsing, & really has a lot to offer. If you‚Äôre looking for an easy way to get connected when you need a source of calm, this could really help",Krystallwithakay,breethe-meditation-sleep,920161006,

I started using the TV to help me get to sleep, which would take hours and hours to make me so tired that eventually I would fall asleep. This was my routine for many years. I tried other sleeping apps, which helped a little but not like Breethe. This app has given me my sleep life back. I select one of their sleep meditations, and before I know it -- I'm off to dreamland. It was the best free trial and it is the best purchase I have ever made. Even when I am in physical  pain, this app still helps me get to sleep. As I mentioned above, I used the TV for many, many years in hope to eventually fall asleep. I am TV free for night-time sleep.

A level I am not proud of and don‚Äôt like. I tried many apps, but this one I personally prefer to most. I have only used it for 1 week now and already see a change on how I feel and my inner self is starting to come to peace. It will take a while to get rid of the stress and feel healthier in my mind, but the journey is well worth it. I only use it once, 10-15min per day.

The whole ‚Äúthink about someone you love... now think about someone you‚Äôre neutral towards, etc ‚Äù approach not only makes for a really distracting meditation, but also makes me examine my relationships instead of looking inward.

Please pull back in that approach and guide us in the here-and-now instead like you use to.

What I enjoyed was feeling all the relaxation in every part of my body while listening to the audio that I was able to choose.

2020-06-09 02:16:05,very expensive and they lie about it having a free option,False,1,"Response to developer: 
You might want to check how it looks to someone who newly signs up, because when you go to the app, the ONLY options it gives is to sign up for the very brief trial, after which you get charged the full price, OR to just sign up at the full price right away. There was nothing that states ‚Äúuse for free‚Äù or anything of the sort, giving the impression that there is no free option. (At which point I wrote my initial review) Then, I closed the app, when I went back to it, it let me use it in the slightest sense. So few of the options are available in the free version. And it doesn‚Äôt tell you until you click on each one individually. So it doesn‚Äôt even have a category for free ones, and it doesn‚Äôt say until you open it. So I opened about 12 different recordings and then then it tells me that I need to be a premium member. And then I gave up. So the free version is pretty useless. 

Original review:
Well, right in the description it says that you can use the free version for as long as you‚Äôd like. But, when you go on the app and sign up, it does not have a free version at all. You have to sign up for a paid version. There is a free two-week trial, but after that you are charged.

The free content was an amount I found helpful as it showed me the usefulness of this app. Purchasing the subscription is worth it to me as it offers so many more valuable resources.

2020-09-26 05:08:46,Benefits Outweigh the Cost,False,5,"I‚Äôm not someone who usually writes review. I‚Äôm quick to tap a star and move on, but this app has saved me more times than I can count and deserves an actual written review. I suffer from PTSD, anxiety (social & generalized anxiety disorder), insomnia, and to add to that I was diagnosed with cancer. Even before my ‚Äúnew‚Äù diagnosis, almost every night I‚Äôd lay in bed with my mind churning, my anxiety rising, and completely unable to sleep despite extreme exhaustion. Despite medications, I‚Äôd lay awake begging my brain to turn off and begging for even 30 minutes of sleep. This was my life for YEARS battling anxiety and insomnia. The nights I did fall asleep, I had horrific nightmares thanks to my PTSD, then I was back up again worse off then I originally started. It was so bad, despite being exhausted, I‚Äôd beg for daylight just so I could get up since trying to sleep was beyond exhausting. This whole time, my lack of sleep, was just adding to my anxiety. I got to the point where I didn‚Äôt want to leave my house- lack of sleep only makes anxiety worse! After dealing with what I thought was an endless cycle of my life, I found this app. Despite not having a lot of extra money, I found myself buying a 1-month subscription. Can I tell you how worth it that decision was?! It literally changed my life. I found myself relaxed, my mind calm, and before I knew it I was waking up after the sun for a change! It was hard to believe that I was up after the birds and after the sun! My nightmares became less frequent and when I do suffer one due to my PTSD, I reopen this app and immediately calm my mind and fall back to sleep. I found my anxiety more manageable and next thing I knew, I‚Äôm writing a small list of things I need and going to the store myself! Not my husband after work, but me! I finally got back to work, became fully engaged in my kids and husband, and my life! When I was diagnosed with cancer (stage 3), it was a rush of sadness, anxiety, and sleepless nights again. I lost my job since chemo and side effects took over my days. I felt since I was even tighter on money that I shouldn‚Äôt renew my subscription to this app. Lying awake again, my husband wakes up and tells me ‚Äúthe benefits of the Breethe app outweigh the cost and either I‚Äôll click subscribe or you do it.‚Äù He was 100% right. After ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù through a couple months of sleepless nights and chemo during the day, I resubscribed! Despite long days of treatments, financial stress, some depression, and anxiety, I felt great the next day! This app seriously changed my life! The benefits truly outweigh the cost! If you suffer as I have in the past, click subscribe and learn to love yourself, life, and bedtime again!

Even though I do not have an actual job to go get paid to do, like anywhere, my job is to be the number wife and mother and also the best ex as well possible because the media has put so much stress on people like me. I am also a past addict (in recent years), who also has dealt with ADHD, PTSD, and insomnia since I was a young child along with the trauma for the PTSD. I have not been on medication for anything since the COVID-19 situation and money being too tight to put myself first.

If only they cooo yo I‚Äôd change a couple of things, I would give this a five star app, that I believe it can be. 

1. There needs to be a model face, like an iPad where you can place the mini-videos arranged in the way you like it and want to hear it. 

2. There needs to be a continuous video option. Some of the videos you can play once a day, but I like to hear the series sometimes all at once and then again. But there isn‚Äôt an option to do that. You can repeat it over and over, but not play videos continuously, then you have to get out of the comfortable position you‚Äôre laying in to change the video. Which is distracting. 

3. You can create a playlist but only limited options. I would like to create videos where there‚Äôs a voice-over with the sound videos at night, not just the sounds. Mix and match ALL videos. 

4. The option is do 20-30-60 mins videos is genius, now if only I can choose that with ALL my videos. Why limit to only a few videos, this is random. 

5. Some of the video educator voice-over speaks generally really fast. If only we had the option to SLOW down the speaker to truly hear it. On audiobooks, they have the option to slow down by 8X, that would be amazing.

The cost is a bit high for the limited options on the app. Some of this is only my opinion and I‚Äôm not sure if it will be seen.
