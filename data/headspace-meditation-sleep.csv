This is the BEST app by far for mindfulness,False,Crazy Yorkie Lady,2021-02-22 18:13:54,"It‚Äôs almost embarrassing to say this, but I have been a ‚Äúmeditator‚Äù for about 30 years and I have to say that I never really got very much out of doing it.  I tried so hard, but I‚Äôm finding out I never truly understood that ‚Äútrying‚Äù to be a good meditator or mindful person, was missing what doing this was about.  What I‚Äôm learning through this app is that ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù is about me - understanding myself first, and it‚Äôs a lot about acceptance.  So with that understanding and acceptance I can begin to see ‚Äúthings‚Äù so much more clearly and why previous ways of thinking, particularly about myself, were holding me back from living my life and loving myself.  And I‚Äôm finding that the more I practice self acceptance, the fears about living fully and going after what I want out of my life, are disappearing.  
The previous version of myself is rapidly becoming someone I only used to know, and this new ME is much more in line with who I‚Äôd always wanted to be.  I‚Äôm able to try and do so much more, all while in the comfort that I am lovable, even if I fail at something.  I simply dust myself off and try some more.
This app has completely changed me and the way I‚Äôm able to appreciate all the good that‚Äôs in my life.  And I‚Äôm worthy of going after the things I want for my life, while freeing me up to share my gifts with others and society in general.
If this is where you find your life stalling out, this app will bring you back to yourself.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
Facing down the rabbit hole,False,KLC-MHFL,2021-02-12 12:42:11,"I discovered Headspace on Netflix. My life is a series of invitations to succumb to fear. My husband is a practicing psychologist who is on peritoneal dialysis for 10 hours every night and works remotely with patients for about 10 hours every day without complaint. We have been waiting for a kidney for two years. I am optimistic by nature but even if this was the only focus for concern it would be a lot. Unhelpfully, the list goes on with equivalent issues. I can‚Äôt work; I need to be on call because I am the go-to for support. I occupy my mind and time writing a book and renovating every room of our home one at a time amidst being available for nine blended (mostly grown) children and 5 grandkids, many of whom have special needs. I am busy but isolated like so many due to covid-19. Trying the Headspace series felt like meeting air; filling the natural and effortless need to breathe. It has provided me with a new lens through which to focus on challenges and see potential. I incorporate it into my waking routine at dawn and it positions me for whatever happens throughout the day, and differentiates a space that is my own. I turn 61 this month and for maybe the first time in a while, life feels lighter and brighter. It‚Äôs not about what you fear or can‚Äôt control or even the fact of fear. It‚Äôs about the lens through which you interpret your fears or challenges and making them your strengths and allies. Thank you Andy :-)",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
A Bright Spot in a Dark World,False,Ashabashley,2021-02-11 06:22:38,"You won‚Äôt regret buying a Headspace subscription. I often joke with people that Headspace is the one thing I would want to take with me to a desert island. If I were to cancel all of my subscriptions today, Headspace is the one exception I would make. I‚Äôm a high school English teacher, and our administration put together a month-long mindfulness education program for our students shortly after I subscribed. I had already raved to many of them about the app and the benefits of taking a couple of minutes out of their day to sit and be present. Lo and behold, Andy pops up on the next slide as our Ted Talk speaker of the day! On a more serious note, I suffer from debilitating chronic pain. I‚Äôm currently on long-term disability and a leave of absence from the classroom. Mindfulness, and the courses on managing pain, have been a tremendous help in my journey. Not only that, but I struggle with insomnia. My favorite part of Headspace, because of my (admittedly) vivid imagination, are the sleepcasts. I love falling asleep to Rainday Antiques. I can‚Äôt imagine doing anything but that ever again. I have learned to manage stress and anxiety in a way that I had never thought was possible. I have meditated in the waiting room of The Cleveland Clinic before my appointments. I once laughed at the idea of mindfulness and meditation. Now it‚Äôs an integral part of my life. It‚Äôs part of my journey, and I think everyone could benefit from it.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
The most useful thing I‚Äôve done in 2020,False,Kindly38,2021-01-18 17:14:21,"This app has given me tools to deal with constant change. This past year, I‚Äôve needed to pivot every day to face some new challenge outside as an essential worker, and at home in isolation with my partner. The tools I Iearned to use to be present in the moment and to accept change has benefited my partner and colleagues at work as much as my own peace of mind. I have very little control over my environment, but I can see my reaction, accept the emotions that rise up, and move on instead of getting lost or bound by them.
This app has also benefited me by helping me get through insomnia. Sometimes it helps me get to sleep in the first place. Mostly it gives me tools to use to calm my mind and body when I wake up in the night buffeted by anxiety or lingering frustration from the day. 
Lastly, this app has given me a language to express the emotional upheaval and troubling questions that I used to just call anxiety. Naming what makes me feel upset has brought clarity to what can feel like a tempest at the time and allow me to look at my thoughts or, rather, face them. After acknowledging them, I can let them go. Sometimes I‚Äôm better at that than at other times. 
Regular exercise strengthens my focus, my ability to pivot and refocus, and builds roads of calm and quiet that the brain finds easier to fall into and travel due to constant use.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
It‚Äôs a Miracle App!,False,jlhuggins,2021-02-08 19:19:10,"This app has helped me so much! When I am suffering from stress, health anxiety, or fibro/stress related body pains I turn to this app and go through some meditations with the teachers. It‚Äôs an excellent way for me to relax. Calm my mind. Stop thinking about myself. And to recover in the moment. Hopefully in time this will help me heal, as previously I‚Äôve just been getting worse and worse without any therapy since my therapist‚Äôs practice permanently shutdown from COVID. This has been a great help and is something I can just pull out of my pocket and sit in my bedroom for a bit to calm down. Well worth the 1 year subscription price I‚Äôve paid.

*There is only one thing that I‚Äôd change. This would be for some of the workout audios. I need to walk a lot for a heart condition I have (which is a big cause of my health anxiety), and I‚Äôd love to see the audios for walks and runs to be a bit longer. The longest run audio I see is 20 minutes, when recommended cardio workout lengths realistically should be at least 30 minutes. I‚Äôd really like to have an audio similar to the bedtime audios that are lengthy, have soothing talk, and tips to reduce anxiety made to be listened while walking. And if there could be a variety to choose from. Overall this would be the only change I can think of. An hour long walk audio to help calm my mind. üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
Grateful for headspace,False,Discosuperflame,2021-04-28 14:52:38,"I freaking love this app. My anxiety was starting to become bad again and I could feel myself falling into depression. I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness and it‚Äôs helped me in the past but I‚Äôve never been able to stick with it for more than a couple of weeks at a time. Then one day while listening to Huberman‚Äôs podcast there was a month free trial and I decided to try it since I‚Äôve always wanted to give this app a go anyway. WELL, let me tell you...this app is changing my life. I am proud to say I am on my 33rd day streak. I can feel myself overall being more present and aware throughout the day. Now, when I start to feel anxious I almost immediately catch myself and can begin using some of the tools and practice I‚Äôve accumulated from headspace. I do want to add though, the key word is PRACTICE. Medication, like Andy says, is a skill and like any skill you must practice. By practicing enough, it does truly become second nature. I know it‚Äôs only been a month but I can already feel the difference and I am looking forward to the future. Thank you headspace team. P.S every little thing about this app is great. I especially love the different courses, the wake ups, the animation shorts, the sleepcasts, the focus music and yoga.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
"Headspace is a excellent, but isn‚Äôt truly free",False,VictorAllThingsTech,2021-05-17 19:06:05,"I heard about this app on tv and saw ads in The Today section of the App Store. I decided to give it a try and it really does help me out. I feel less stressed, calm, and feel ready for anything. It‚Äôs like a guide or tool which helps push you to be a better you. So then comes the question, is it worth it? I think so. For instance if you have ADHD or feel stressed most days (maybe because of work or school) use this. 

Everything is not sunshine and rainbows. For one, $13 to me feels somewhat pricey. Other meditation apps that I found are cheaper than what Headspace currently offers. Another thing is that it lacks free content. There‚Äôs only very little that Headspace offers and it‚Äôs not a lot. It‚Äôs almost as if your forced into paying for a subscription in order to use it. I really didn‚Äôt want to do that and I have now canceled it since I felt that it was overly priced. 

Headspace is great and I may say that‚Äôs is better than most apps I‚Äôve used. But I don‚Äôt like the fact that after going through the tutorial it locks most of the content Headspace offers you and forces you into a subscription that feels overly priced. Yeah, they give you a free trial but after that your pretty much forced. Offer more videos that are free and let people decide for themselves. If you do those things I may bump my stars to 5.",4,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
Very good but expensive,False,FortnitePro#1,2021-01-11 02:30:38,"So I‚Äôve been using headspace for quite awhile now and personally I think it‚Äôs great! But the thing is since I don‚Äôt have premium, I have to keep on repeating the same old things like the rain day antiques sleepcast I‚Äôve heard that sleep cast so many times and now I keep getting annoyed with it. That goes the same with the other sleep stuff too like the sleep music I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúdoze‚Äù so many times I wake up like every 30 minutes or so. Also goes the same with the two free wind downs. The first time I used the free wind downs I fell asleep instantly the second time after that I couldn‚Äôt sleep for ten minutes. So after that, I wanted to do a free trial for the premium but I didn‚Äôt realize I was short on money. Since most people do a free trial for like a week or so they cancel there payment the day before the payment is due. So I tried doing that but it asked for but then I realized they need to know my payment information before doing my free trial. I think it was because they don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna cancel my payment or actually do the payment. So yeah, I think this app is amazing it just needs to either lower down the price by like 3-4$ or maybe add one or two me free sleepcasts and same goes to the wind downs, and music.

Life changing,False,vmonjian,2020-10-04 01:59:51,"This app and Andy‚Äôs gentle and soothing guidance in it have absolutely changed my life for the better and in a big way. I‚Äôve been meditating using the Headspace app as regularly as I can with a run streak of 180 days once. The streaks do not really matter, but staying consistent does. I consider the guidance and wisdom that Andy imparts in the app therapeutic. Friends, family and colleagues regularly tell me how much more serene, kind and patient I have become even in very tough situations. Those attributes would have never been applied to me had it not been for this app. The packages are godsend, like on patience, kindness, generosity...etc. Each package has ten guided sessions. Once I‚Äôm done with one package I either start again (some I‚Äôve done more than 20 times) or start another one of my favorite packages. No, I‚Äôm not paid to sponsor these guys. I have not only gotten it (I.e. paid) for myself, but for my wife too. I‚Äôve also offered to pay for friends‚Äô or relatives‚Äô apps too. Don‚Äôt think twice about it.

Superior,False,Gingerooney,2020-01-05 00:54:47,"As a TM practitioner I wasn't initially drawn to this app.  However it was recommended repeatedly by health practitioners as I struggled to be consistent with my sitting practice. Finally I gave in and it's been a wonderful asset to my meditation practice. I use it as an anchor and I enjoy the presentations as well as the guided series and singles. The SOS and now the many other options are great. Being able to grab your phone and calm yourself in stressful times is amazing.  Headspace has continued to improve adding more and more options and modules. You can stick with classic guided or semi guided meditation, or silence, add music or learn how to use mindfulness on a broad range of issues from speaking, sadness, grief ...  you name it. I love the special section on sleep. The educational aspect is beyond compare and you can watch short videos.  I still have a strong preference for Andy Puddicome‚Äôs voice and hope he never tires of doing this, but glad the options are there for others.   This simply is the best app for meditation and for mindfulness. THE BEST. I highly recommend this to anyone--from those being introduced to meditation and/mindfulness to the experienced practitioner.

Great resource!,False,zigalellium,2021-01-15 15:44:26,"This is really helpful! The only reason I didn‚Äôt give a higher rating is because there‚Äôs a strong overlying tone of a sales pitch there. Which is unfortunate, because I think people would be able to see the value easier if there wasn‚Äôt a push for money after every meditation and for many of the things on the app people would want to explore. Kind of stalls progress of the meditation itself when you‚Äôve just worked so hard to pull yourself back, only to be instantly asked for money right after. From a company stand point I also think it would be more beneficial to work on building value and then freely offering the option to see what monthly costs are and also show a detailed description of what‚Äôs involved with a paid membership. I know this has worked well financially for other services and I‚Äôve seen increases in sales by simply looking at things from the customers perspective. And I feel like the customers perspective is a miss here :(
However quite and easy fix and overall this app is amazing! It not only teaches the basics of meditation, but teaches different techniques as well. This makes it good for beginners all the way to experts.

I travel quite a bit and I love that I‚Äôm able to pick my environment of choice to meditate. I always thought meditation meant quieting your thoughts etc... but when I learned that it was part of being mindfulness and being present in the now it helped immensely in my day to day well being. When I did the anxiety course that really helped in so many ways because I thought you could get rid of it. But learning to become aware of it and being present with it, I felt it wasn‚Äôt so much of a burden. I‚Äôve had trouble on and off sticking to it consistently but I‚Äôm trying it again. It‚Äôs nice to be able to have it there especially when I know how much of a positive impact it has had on my life.

I was pregnant at the time and was under a lot of stress at my job. I started with the pregnancy course on the app. This was so amazing. First of all, Andy‚Äôs voice is incredibly calming. Then the pregnancy meditation helped me feel closer to baby. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and when I was less stressed, my glucose was lower. This app helped me a ton with that. Then, when I went to my 29 week check up, I had just read a work email I was very upset about. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was high. They sent me to the hospital for monitoring. While I was there I practiced the meditation I had learned and was able to get my blood pressure down so I could go home! The meditations also helped me get through labor! Now that I had my baby, I‚Äôm still using this app because it just helps me find calm in my crazy world of being and full time working mom during a pandemic.

I am only 24 so my stress shouldn‚Äôt be what it is in my opinion. So I took his advice on meditation and did some research and found this app. I‚Äôm still in the free trial stages of it but I will most definitely buy is once it ends. The reason I give 4 start is because I wish there were more mindful activities because of my job. I wake up at 6 am and come home from anywhere between 5pm - 11pm depending on the day I have. So it would be nice to have more mindful activities where I can use the app an work or do things at home with out it being the same thing. Or more on commuting. I‚Äôm driving all day long so to have something I can listen to while driving that isn‚Äôt music or just for a commute home would be nice. But other than that I have no complaints!

The wonders of headspace,False,Sav.Dragan,2021-03-26 14:57:09,"In my abnormal psychology class we learned anxiety is not just a fight or flight response but instead can be a future oriented response. Abnormal anxiety usually is characterized by presenting when there is no real danger. Therefore when I lay down in bed to sleep and I start getting an increase heart rate, feel extremely hot and sometimes nauseous at the idea of future situations and work that I have yet to do, it‚Äôs abnormal. Even if many people experience this is is abnormal because there is no real threat just my brain over thinking future situations. Therefore on my quest to look for ways to relax my mind before bed I downloaded headspace. I usually listen to a guided meditation before bed. Followed I will set one of their sleep music for 60 minutes and lay down. I now am normally asleep before the sleep music stops. Even though in my class we talked more about biological and psychological treatments, I felt as though there might be an easier way for me to deal with this anxiety.

Why can't I see my today screen on the watch and start my various mediations from the watch. the watch app gets 1 star. 2. Shortcuts: on the iphone I have setup a sleep schedule. On the ""good night"" screen I am given the option to run shortcuts. Headspace offers a few shortcuts that can be called from this screen. One is the nightly ""sleepcast"". the sleepcast is supposzed to be different every night. It is different on my today screen, but the shortcut always plays the ""Rainyday Antiques"". therefore the shortcut is useless. this part of the app gets 1 star. Lastly, the philosophy behind this app is mindlessness. It is taught as a universal fix for bringing the mind to a place of ease. As such it is a religious philosophy. I think they need to be more open about this and they need to state that the point of this is to alleviate suffering.

I thought it was great, but wanted to shop around and see what all of the individual meditation apps had to offer, but Headspace is the clear winner.

The general organization of the interface is great in its simplicity, because you can easily toggle between the app‚Äôs different features with the navigation on the bottom, and there‚Äôs only five options so it‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing to me. Speaking of aesthetics, the graphics shown while meditating are very uplifting, simple, and non-intimidating. I think apps like Calm that have the ability to show/do nature sounds are cool, but that feels like too many decisions as to what graphic to choose. The soft Australian accent that Andy has is very calming but feels more non-judgmental, like an old friend who‚Äôs just being your guide through the meditation.

Tools that would help me open my heart and mind to new possibilities and a more peaceful and compassionate approach to myself and the world. With the gentle and insightful guidance of Andy and the other practitioners, I feel safe and supported in my efforts to face and walk through difficult times.

Great features; trouble with record-keeping,False,Carlyey,2020-12-17 21:03:38,"The meditations are great, and I‚Äôve been finding the focus music feature really great for listening while working; it‚Äôs at least as good as the ambient music I typically listen to. My only complaint at the moment is that listening to the focus music counts toward minutes meditated, and then to Apple Health mindfulness minutes if you have that option on on. So if I listen to 3 hours of focus music while working, plus one morning meditation, it seems like I‚Äôve meditated for 185 minutes, when I‚Äôve really only done 3. And it seems to count the music toward my streak, too, which doesn‚Äôt really help me keep track of my progress in building a habit of mindfulness. Listening to focus-helping music while working‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve always done‚Äîis totally different than actually meditating.

It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, of course‚ÄîI can manually keep track‚Äîbut it would be nice if the app let you distinguish between what‚Äôs real time spent with mindful practice, and what‚Äôs just listening to music while working.",4,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
Changed My Relationship With Anxiety,False,rachelnotfromfriends,2021-02-26 14:04:06,"Have been using this app for years, since 2017. It has completely changed the way I manage my anxiety. Not only do they have a course for anxiety, but there are also SOS meditations that are super helpful when you‚Äôre in the middle of panic mode. Since I first got the app they have added so many new meditations, courses, and even instructors. It has grown with me as my meditation practice has grown and it is always a great day when I use the Headspace app. 
As far as the price it is definitely on the expensive side. I first started using the app when I was in college and was lucky to be in a financial situation where I could afford it. I know they are offering it for free to those who have been affected by the coronavirus. However, my one critique is that they should make a student version, so more people will have access to this life-changing app.

There are enough great meditation pointers though that it‚Äôs been super helpful to get over some hurdles I was struggling with and the voices are very relaxing.

Another thing that happens is that at least for me it glitches and says it‚Äôs a free soundtrack or anything like that, But then it says ‚ÄúSorry this isn‚Äôt working right now‚Äù And when I go to my recents it says its premium.

Great Quality for Mental Health,False,sillydog,2021-02-11 16:11:24,"Quality: The app never glitches, the content is bountiful and inspires curiosity of oneself and the world around. I‚Äôve had this app for over a year now. It is the only yearly subscription worthy of my money from the App Store. I‚Äôm glad I had this when COVID hit. 

Benefit: These meditation courses and singles have been a life saver for my gifted 10yr old daughter working through PTSD in therapy from trauma. Through the kid section she has learned how to use her breath, and at night, calming sounds or stories to help keep her brain wandering into negative places. She has even worked her way through the grieving courses to help her cope with COVID closing our schools. Her understanding of coping skill usage has increased exponentially and has learned awareness of her feelings in her body.

But, I too have benefited. Without this training, I would have a hard time helping my daughter. Aside from that, the app has reminded me about how to be my creative self again. From gently progressing meditation courses to the video and clever animation shorts that help you to understand foundational concepts, I am feeling enjoyment in my life no matter where I am or what is happening.

Meditation should transcend politics,False,DWil9059230,2021-07-02 13:40:31,"This app has a lot of traditionally based vipassana-style meditation, which is very helpful for learning to meditate and gaining its benefits. However, the app has recently uploaded a lot of political content directly supporting movements such as Black Lives Matter and the ideology of critical race theory. It‚Äôs hard to emphasize enough how disastrous of a decision this is. It is reducing the transcendent method of meditation to a mere ideological political tool. Meditation allows you the psychological freedom to see passed concepts that you‚Äôve established unconsciously your whole life and to use that freedom to live deliberately and compassionately with all peoples. Critical race theory attempts to add concepts such as privilege to push you to act in a particular way not necessarily aligned with your deepest intuitions and compassionate motivations. So, it‚Äôs a reduction of what the practice could be (vipassana, insight, and metta, loving-kindness) for the short-term aims of a political ideology. If you are interested in meditation and not politics, I recommend the Waking Up app, which has vipassana and meta meditations as well as dharma lectures from some eminent practitioners.

I would caution people to not let mindfulness techniques promoting optimistic mentalities obscure an important skill for developing real danger.

 I came to this app for sleep help got a subscription and got what I wanted. They gave me real ways to help me sleep. I realized that was meant for meditation I ended up getting dragged into the meditation part and now I love the app so much! 

My constructive criticism: 
I mostly use the app for my sleep. I would like in their surveys for them to give something about what stress is most is to take into account not everyone who is using the app is a true adult and not everyone is actually doing work. I think I would say it‚Äôs causing the most stress is school for me. So I would like for in the surveys for them to include the fact that some people are using this app for sleeping purposes and some people are also technically kids who are in school and what is stressing them might not necessarily be what you put on the quiz.

I'd love to give this app 5 stars, but it's lacking a crucial feature.

I miss the way the app was organized and the way the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù was a couple years ago when they used a softer-pallet color scheme for the thumbnails. Back when the Headspace logo was an all caps font. The bold colors (especially in the sleep sections) are too saturated for my taste and seem at a discord for a company promoting stillness in the mind. I also miss the layout/menu organization that the app had back then. But since those complaints have more to do with the recent packaging choices, and not with the actual ‚Äúpackage‚Äù I still give 5 stars because the content is excellent.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

A good deal of the anxiety I had been experiencing daily has gone away, without any change in external circumstance. Meditation has helped me slow down and learn to breathe and be calm. I feel more agency over my mood and internal well-being. My wife has commented many times on how present I seem (and how grateful she is for that!).

Headspace Move, the exercise program, focuses on a mindful approach to physical exercise, something I had never experienced before, and it has added a good deal of joy to my physical routine. The video production and design work are outstanding, as is the coaching. I do wish, however, that there was a bit more emphasis on form throughout the workouts ‚Äì if I did not have previous experience with some of the exercises, I might be a bit lost as to how to do them properly and without risk of injury. That said, the emphasis on being gentle and listening to the body each day has certainly helped.

As a student this is a very helpful app. It‚Äôs also great to get moving! Or fall asleep to! Or even focus too!

It‚Äôs super accessible for all types of people, and it makes meditation seem logical and practical, rather than some kind of magical state that I never felt I could achieve before.

For one, it‚Äôd be nice to have some kind of goal setting based on what I am going through in life. Right now, it is hard not to get distracted by the billion colorful cards and many other auto playing videos or moving images.

To take in my life one step at a time and observe my anxieties rather than try and control them. This gives me a better understanding of what is really happening. 

Not to mention, the sleepscapes help me fall asleep with stories to help keep my mind off of everything else. Wind down sessions to start off to help get you comfortable for bed, followed by soothing story telling that puts me asleep nearly instantly. I love the continuations of the sleep scapes too!

Now it‚Äôs large, looping videos of food, people dancing, jerky, multi-angled camera shots...not something someone with anxiety wants to see at 3AM.

I‚Äôve been paying annually for three years and it‚Äôs money well spent. With Headspace, the practice of mediation feels accessible and fun. The service itself is 5-stars. 

The apps, however, need refinement on some platforms, in particular iPad OS and Watch OS. The iPad forces the app to play in Portrait only, which means you have to turn your head sideways if you‚Äôre using the iPad‚Äôs Magic Keyboard. Also, videos like Mindful Earth play well in this format. 

I also find the Apple Watch app very disappointing. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but it only shows a 1 minute Breathe Mini meditation.

Another helpful feature are the sleep sounds. The 8 hour ones are especially helpful to me overnight. I‚Äôd love it if they‚Äôd develop more 8 hour ones.

I‚Äôve bought yearly subscription for about 10 people, and I've been using it nonstop since 2012. The reasons why me review went down from 5 stars to 3 are the following:
1) They are not releasing daily meditations anymore. This was extremely valuable, and they‚Äôve replace it with something called ‚ÄúThe Wake Up‚Äù which is very hit and miss.
2) They have gotten somewhat political. I understand that brands need to stand for what they believe in, and all that‚Äôs great. But in a world where politics is now everywhere (in sports,movies,social media etc) Headspace always felt like a refuge, like a place where you could tune out all that external noise and just breathe and relax.

Sure, there are four or five short meditations, sounds, and headspaces, but there is so much content unavailable to non-premium users. It‚Äôs annoying and the app is, essentially, useless unless you pay the expensive fee. As a minor going into highschool I don‚Äôt have the money or the time. 

If you‚Äôre considering getting this app, by all means, get it. Try the premium. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs helpful.

Headspace is my favorite app !,False,Irisherin95,2021-04-15 08:08:47,"I have had a subscription to this app for a very long time. I first started using it for sleep.  I could never fall asleep... I would toss and turn for hrs, sometimes all night and not even get a min of sleep. This was extremely frustrating and it was affecting many aspects of my life in a negative way.  I have chronic back pain, and I could never get comfortable, so I thought about this pain all night. My mind racing, knowing that I had work in the morning and I was just miserable.  So, I started using the wind downs.  I incorporated that with a beginners course on meditation.  After some time and practice, I was beginning to see real improvement.  Then I added the sleep stories, I didn‚Äôt think they would work at first, because I believed that the story would have me too focused on the story and not fall asleep. Again, after a week or two, I was falling asleep before the story ended.  Then I did the pain course...to help me understand my relationship with pain.  It did wonders. Over months I was dedicating at least one time a day to meditation.  I also have anxiety, and have been working on that.  But there is so much more on this app. Yoga, healthy eating, music, and a lot of helpful info and meditations.  I have tried other apps while using this one. Some were pretty good and some just weren‚Äôt for me. This app is honestly an app I can‚Äôt live without.  I love it!  I am living a healthier lifestyle and also sleeping so much better. I recommend this app to ANYONE & everyone.  They add new courses and different aspects to it all the time.  I will NEVER cancel this app.  I have begun to look at life different. My mood is more positive, I am focusing more, and I encourage anyone looking for a place to start a meditation journey to start with this app.  There‚Äôs so much information and I can‚Äôt go a day without it.

Even though mediation sounds ‚Äòdumb‚Äô for some people, Headspace is the very opposite; it gives me mindfulness tips and follow up with a mediation, making the mindfulness lesson more memorable, and what I learned so far (and all of them are so freaking helpful) are: observe thoughts instead of reacting and getting carried away with them, if we‚Äôre reacting to thoughts we are keeping the emotion alive, adding more fuel to the fire; let‚Äôs thoughts come and go, with a gentle or effortless focus; having a daydream sense of mind let‚Äôs us take things less seriously and it gives us more freedom, and sooooo many more (I can‚Äôt remember all at the moment).

Flashy but needs more depth,False,aud_jones,2020-02-29 13:21:32,"I have used three meditation apps including Headspace, so I know what‚Äôs out there. I settled on Headspace because I thought it had a much larger gallery of meditations and most meditations are customizable to the point where you can even change the voice style (female or male). I liked it at first but I‚Äôm growing frustrated because each meditation ‚Äúlesson‚Äù seems to all be the same. Whether you want to meditate for anxiety, self-confidence, kindness... you will be doing the exact same guided meditation. The only difference is the excerpt at the beginning of the meditation is about whichever topic you‚Äôre meditating on. I personally think each one of these meditations could be much more tailored. Anxious people can‚Äôt sit and imagine a wave of light washing over them. Anxiety often causes shallow breathing, racing thoughts, tension. The best meditations for anxiety is plenty breath work & someone talking you through a meditation while incorporating soothing reassurances about overcoming anxiety. Another app I have used is very good at this and I‚Äôm thinking about switching back for this very reason. They have less meditations but at least they‚Äôre all unique. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a flashy app with a pretty interface but not much beneath the surface, this app is for you. I hope someone from the Headspace team reads this because this app would be amazing if the meditations were genuinely as tailored as they appear to be on the surface. I‚Äôm so tired of being told to focus briefly on my breathing and then picture ‚Äúlight‚Äù washing over me for the next 10 minutes.

The meditation modules sometimes do not sync up with your phone‚Äôs audio system. Meaning, you have no idea wether you‚Äôre still playing or where you are at with your meditation. It goes from a surplus talking, to minutes of silence all within seconds. They seem to teach you the lesson before settling in which does not make sense because you‚Äôre not in a settled mind to absorb the lesson. Every single module follows almost the same exact pattern and reuses the same 2-3 visualizations (pin break light, liquid sunshine, body scan). The enunciation of some words are very harsh and non soothing, and they very rarely give you a female option. The ‚Äúdaily programs‚Äù only work if you watch them back to back to back because they refer to the previous day instead of giving a brief recap (makes sense for some people, not for those who have had an entire day and a half go by before they could meditate). I‚Äôve only found one of the night time stories to have an ambience that wasn‚Äôt overpowering and distracting - the nightmare SOS meditation has a terrible voiceover, it is way too harsh of a voice for soothing nightmares at 2AM. 

This app frustrates me as soon as I open it and starts off my meditation with a very negative view. I personally would recommend the Calm app to anyone who struggles with these same issues. The usability and function of it works a lot better than this app. You‚Äôre able to scrub scroll, it gives you preset background music (so you know you‚Äôre still playing), the meditations aren‚Äôt repetitive with the same exercises, and if the accents distract you as much as they do to myself - calm provides several accents and multiple gender options for EVERY module (not just a few like headspace).

Good app,False,kireahm22,2021-04-17 23:09:02,"I have heard of apps similar to this one before and figured I would give it a try to relax me since with finals are just around the corner and deadlines are getting closer. I decided to put my goal at reducing stress and anxiety and the first thing I got was  prompoted to a ‚ÄúFeeling overwhelmed‚Äù talk down to get myself relaxed and calm. The voice was not all that calming and relaxing, but he did have an accent that was very mesmorizing that helped let go of some tension. 

After setting some goals for myself Headspace created a list of things for me to accomplish throughout the day and the first thing was to take five deep breaths. What I loved about this was the music was very calming, but still had some upbeats it helped with when we were holding, breathing in, and exhaling. Another great component was there was a little face that would do the exercise with you and when you would inhale it would smile.

The way this app relates with anxiety and panic attacks is, I think this can be beneficial to help get our heart rates down, get us to focus on other things, and help us relax. I think this would be incredibly useful in situations of discomfort of nervousness, I know this would help me and many others. Breathing methods help center us, by doing the five breaths with the app helped me feel more in control and calm of what I was doing. I have shared this app with my family, as I know they have been going through some hard times lately and they could use something to relax and destress them. 

Stress can be hard to manage, and a lot of the talking ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù seem to help with trying to get you to let go or trying to find other things to distract ourselves with so we dont become too overwhelmed. Overall, I think this app has some benefits it helps calm you, center you, and puts you at peace. It certainly helped my anxiety be more managable while doing assignments and it helped me get in the right direction for the next couple of hours with my work and overall wellness. I can definitely see myself using this in a store to distract myself from my anxiety because this type of stuff can be grounding.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

Good and Bad ? 1 star or 5 stars ? ü§î,False,Losabesol,2021-06-09 08:08:55,"Was thinking of giving it 1 star‚Ä¶ below is why‚¨áÔ∏è

Headspace is truly a wonderful app.
It has evolved through time with new features made for every kind of person. New high quality content is constantly added. 

I started meditation and mindfulness through Andy‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúHeadspace Guide To Meditation and Mindfulness‚Äù and it was a game changer. Eventually I downloaded the app and, sometime after, I started paying annual membership. I do so without regret because of what the app offers. The opportunity to access guided meditation by teachers such as Andy is incredible!!  Everyday life is a fight, the world is going fast, our lives as well‚Ä¶for me, the app has become an necessary aide for motivation and resources. 

Precisely this is why I almost gave it 1 star. Everything is so magnificent it has generated dependency.  It is so good, that now it seems very difficult for me to meditate without it. It is as if I‚Äôve lost my ability, will, and/or discipline to acquire headspace on my own. Makes sense? Maybe. Foreseeable? Most likely. Inevitable? Not really. Could be just me? Definitely. As of writing this comment, I will actively work to put in practice meditation and mindfulness on my own again.

My advice for anyone reading the review is to go for it. Try it out, learn the basics and reap the benefits !!!  but be careful to practice being present and dealing with your mind without having to use the app. I believe the app can‚Äôt become essential in our lives. Good luck !",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

"please, give yourself the present of meditation",False,REB!,2020-04-06 20:45:12,"Learning meditation through Andy and the Headspace team has been life changing. 

I‚Äôve learned so much through the app. Some things that I‚Äôve been learning recently are: 
1. Change is the only constant in life. Each moment in life is never the same as before. Being more present in each moment helps me embrace change, especially when ‚Äúbig‚Äù changes arise. Big change, small change. It‚Äôs all basically the same. What matters more is the calm awareness of change and the compassion for self and others that follows. 
2. Dealing with distractions, restlessness, anxiety. These things often manifest as feelings or mental chatter in my head. I‚Äôm learning to note these feelings and thoughts as they come, simply as feelings and thoughts, which gives me the headspace to choose to engage with them in a calm manner or set them aside and return my focus to whatever task is at hand. This has also helped me immensely with time management, falling asleep, combatting impulsiveness, etc. 
3. Other things I‚Äôve been learning, but now I‚Äôm going to list them because this review is getting long: Discipline, consistency, appreciation, regret, anger, stillness, exercising and eating mindfully. Honestly I could go on and on. 

Do yourself and those you love a favor by growing in awareness and compassion through Headspace. Honestly if everyone used this app, the world would be a slightly better place. There should be a clinical trial on this published in JAMA. Can I be hired to do this? ü§ì",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

Of course it‚Äôs not a cure-all, but I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs a help-all. It‚Äôs helped me in managing anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, grief, loneliness, being over-excited for events, ect. It‚Äôs even been of one the tools I use to calm my mind and help prevent migraines if I feel a small one coming on. 

Personal experiences:

One night, back when I was pregnant, I was panicking from the grief of my mother dying of brain cancer, and that night I felt I could barely walk because of the overwhelming emotions I was having, but prayer and headspace helped me calm myself enough to function again that night. 

When I moved to a city after living my whole life in rural areas, headspace and prayer were what helped me overcome the feelings of being trapped and anxious. I started out with the free trial which was great. Then I was gifted the premium and I enjoyed that, though I wish it was always free ;). I‚Äôm back to the basics now, and it is still helpful.

Overall, headspace has helped me calm down on a regular basis to levels I didn‚Äôt think were possible for me. Headspace along with counseling have led the way for me to overcome negative thought patterns I‚Äôve had my whole life. 

Headspace has taught me mindfulness meditation and helped me accept myself and appreciate my present reality. These techniques has showed me how to be as calm and clear headed as God intended when he created our bodies and minds to have those calming mechanisms such as deep breathing and visualizations already built in. Headspace can just help you discover those. 

Headspace changed the way I help myself and my children cope with strong emotions. It‚Äôs helped me be more present and grounded in my own life, and that‚Äôs huge for me. Thanks, headspace.",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

Ten months in and I have a lot to say,False,KMil3,2020-02-15 07:07:24,"I started using headspace in April 2019. 
TLDR: The app is phenomenal for learning how to meditate, and more specifically for teaching the techniques used and giving you a guided experience. It‚Äôs also great for keeping you accountable with streaks. It can get repetitive and glitchy at times, but overall I recommend the app to people pretty often. 

The long version 
Pros: 
‚Ä¢I love the daily headspace meditations and the fact that it‚Äôs a new topic every day, but I wish the intro pieces were a little bit longer. They‚Äôre great insights/perspectives, and I would benefit from more of that on a daily basis. 
‚Ä¢Headspace on sleep has been life altering at helping me get to sleep. Guided progressive relaxation and a specific task for my mind help my mental and physical reconnect and prepare to sleep. 
‚Ä¢The pain management pack has really helped me come to terms with chronic sciatic/back/leg pain and learn not to fight it, which makes it worse. I‚Äôve learned to accept it as an unpleasant reality and acknowledge the pain, which in turns helps to lessen its intensity. 

Cons:
‚Ä¢The meditations get repetitive. Doesn‚Äôt matter what class pack or daily headspace you do, it‚Äôs essentially the same technique each time and it gets kind of old. Again, i‚Äôd like to hear more of the insights Andy has and it‚Äôd be cool to mix up the techniques a little more, even between days of the same pack (e.g. light visualization one day, body scan one day, progressive relaxation one day). 
‚Ä¢Sometimes in the sleep meditations, hearing the voice come back startles me awake again and TERRIFIES me so that I can‚Äôt calm down again for a while. 
‚Ä¢Sometimes Andy is just too chatty for me during a meditation. On the other hand, the longer meditations aren‚Äôt really beneficial, it‚Äôs just a prolonged version of the shorter ones with awkward timing of the ‚Äútasks‚Äù within the meditation. There‚Äôs no additional content at the beginning, and sometimes the body scans or breath counting segments get waaaaay too long and i totally lose my train of thought. Alternatively, often the body scans are waaaaay too short in the shorter meditations. 
‚Ä¢The app is glitchy. It‚Äôll log you out at random, it cuts off and closes completely during the middle of my meditations sometimes (especially with the Headspace 365 pack).",4,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

Have loved for years but not the new 2.0 version,False,D in NYC ,2021-03-11 14:17:37,"I should have reviewed this app years ago. 5 stars for sure. I‚Äôve recommended it to so many friends and have given it as a gift many times as well.   

I took a hiatus much of this last crazy year (ironically when I prob needed it the most) and when I recently came back, I see the total redesign with a ton of new content. So now we are scrolling through all this content, tons of media, noise, and suggested to set a myriad of notifications?!  Is this conducive to a quiet mind? No. In fact, every time I open the app I end up feeling super anxious.  I thought it was a one off, but it‚Äôs happened each time. It‚Äôs too much noise and it‚Äôs too chaotic at the time in the morning when I‚Äôm trying to start my day off right by focusing on presence, quieting the mind, and setting my intentions before leaping into my crazy day.  Now, instead of being a respite, a place for grounding, this app mirrors much of what life looks like these days and all social media apps.  Honestly, this really feels like Headspace ‚Äúsold out.‚Äù

Once you dig around and find what you‚Äôre looking for, Andy‚Äôs soothing guided meditations are still there, and I do love the ambient noise and low-fi tracks that have been added. I get it. You‚Äôre trying to corner the market on all things zen. Gotcha. There‚Äôs a BD team making very different decisions than our beloved yogis and zen masters. So....

In the spirit of both staying true to the mission AND in consumer satisfaction (which is of course, good business) I will offer the perfect solution, instead of canceling my membership (yet) bc Andy is the best. Create a customizable home page. Let me drag over only the things I want on my page.  It would be what I see when I open the app and no need to navigate elsewhere if I don‚Äôt want to.  I would personally choose to keep it uncluttered and super simple with my mediations and maybe some music. Others may do something diff. To each their own.   And when I‚Äôm not in mediation mode, maybe then I‚Äôll choose to dig around the other media and content to check out your new stuff, and drag and drop new favorites to my page.  But opening this app and seeing this chaotic stream of content is not sustainable for me, and I cannot imagine that I am alone in that.",2,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,"{'id': 21637993, 'body': ""Thank you for your feedback and we're sorry for any trouble navigating the app. If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to our team at help@headspace.com.

There were days when I would consider it a success if I made it the whole day without crying. I‚Äôve been using this app religiously for minths now and my thought patterns have become much less illogical. I use this app twice a day, for a morning meditation and then got a sleep meditation. This may be a surprise (haha) but I often struggled to turn my brain off enough to go to sleep as well. 

I am in a completely different mindset these days and don‚Äôt dwell on negative thoughts like I used to. These meditations are different than I expected, and honestly I was skeptical. I thought why wouldn‚Äôt I just listen to a free one from YouTube? While they almost seem simpler, my outcomes are better and that‚Äôs what I care about.

I would strongly recommend this app (and have to many of my friends, family, and coworkers). Try use it daily for a few weeks before you make a decision.

Great! Please Streamline the Sleep Section!,False,Lauren C. D.,2020-12-22 13:26:28,"Update: 21-Dec-2020
I‚Äôve been using this a few years now, and the Headspace app is still wonderful!! I love that you can do multiple meditation packs simultaneously, based on what you want to focus on that day. The ever-rotating daily meditations are great too!! Thank you! 

Things I would request/improve upon: 
‚Ä¢ The rotating aspect of the daily meditations are great, but please add a way to listen to them beyond that Day!  Maybe add a ‚ÄúPrevious Daily Meditations‚Äù section? I‚Äôd also love to be able to refer back to previous episodes of ‚ÄúThe Wake Up‚Äù‚Äî though I‚Äôm not sure if that works be an app thing or a YouTube on.  
‚Ä¢ Regarding the sleep section: first off, I love it.  I live in a city, so the cover noise it provides is a game changer for how quickly I can fall asleep.  Moreover, I love the 500 minutes option for the ‚ÄúSleep Radio‚Äù and some of the ‚ÄúSleepcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúSleep Music‚Äù‚Äî please extend this capability to all of them!  Otherwise, once the Sleepcasts‚Äô timer runs out, silence ensues, and then the outside nose takes over again, waking the sleeper and bringing them back to square one. 
 ‚Ä¢ Also, the ‚ÄúWind downs‚Äù have an option to choose which narrator to use, while the ‚ÄúSleepcasts‚Äù section has separate tab entries for the same male/female or ASMR/[non-ASMR] Sleepcast theme.  
Overall, while having lots options is great, a bit more streamlining of the options in that section would be appreciated.  Without sacrificing the content, it could be made more efficient in terms of presentation and UX.  

‚Ä¢ Lastly, please add a yoga section to your ‚ÄúMove‚Äù tab! While some of the recordings touch on yoga (7-Minute; Gentle Flow), so much more could be incorporated. With all the mindfulness that both Yoga and Meditation provide, this seems a match made in Heaven!  You could even call it a ‚Äúmoving meditation‚Äù!

Of course, these are all just suggestions and I‚Äôm still beyond grateful for the wonderful meditations and how accessible Headspace has made them for me (and thousands of others). Thank you!! Happy Holidays and Happy New Year! 

Update: 2-Oct-2017
Back to awesome!! I love that you can do multiple meditation packs simultaneously, and yay you added the Body Scan in, as requested!! Thank you! 
I took an inadvertent break from Headspace due to phone issues, but now I'm back and can't wait to have this in my everyday routine again!!!

Update: 27-Feb-2017
Well it Was awesome the First 14 days... now I can't get anything to download, it somehow lost my downloads of previous sessions and lost my 11-Day streak as a result! It just says ""waiting to download"" for all my upcoming sessions in Level 2! 
I'm Very disappointed! Please fix this, and I'll restore the stars docked for this. Still gets an extra star because out of the gate it was still wonderful.

Awesome meditation practice! So many people say they don't have time for this or that, but the 10-minute practice is wonderful because Everyone can find 10 minutes out of their day. I just started Level 2 of the Foundation series and I can't wait to continue my new daily routine! 

One thing I'd request is a guided ""Body scan""-- every meditation in the training has had it, but it would be nice to get a clearer idea of what specifically to focus on.  A few friends and I did a yoga teacher training, which heavily included meditations, and we all found it helpful to have a guided body scan, especially when we were first starting out. 
Otherwise this app is amazing and my new favorite morning routine!",4,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

3 - Zero motivating audios most of them talk about mental problems, why talk about problems when there are solutions? Talk about solutions.
4 - Can get higher quality material in YouTube for free.
5 - Only two voices? I have no idea how this app made so much money and reviews! Kindergarten drawings and two prerecorded people talking? Not worth it.
6 - Focus music makes me sleep. Maybe a couple could be saved.
7 - The techniques which are less than a minute are great! Sadly only a small part of the app.
8 - Workouts are ok but too guided.

This has been very difficult for me, as I was finding it hard to not take their words, tones, and actions personally. Headspace has been an essential tool to help me through guided meditation during stressful and overwhelming moments. It taught me an essential skill, the ability to allow these negative actions to roll off my shoulders instead of sink into my heart. It has also helped tremendously with my insomnia, especially since my main problem when trying to fall asleep is a busy mind.

"Paid for lifetime, still getting charged",False,That anime band geek,2020-05-15 19:03:32,"I would like to start by saying the app has been seriously helpful to me in the last two years. I‚Äôve had leaps and bounds with stress management, better sleep and exercise. I will continue to use headspace going forward, as I appreciate it‚Äôs applications and it is now solidified into my routines. However, I will be continuing my use of headspace only through their website, as the app has a few problems that I have noticed as of late that I can no longer ignore. 

Two years ago, I paid roughly $400 for the lifetime subscription, and after emailing the company I have confirmed this. I was unaware that the app itself DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION. I was charged last year for $100 during a very bad time and it set me back that month with expenses. To prevent having to pay that again, I switched to the 12.99 a month subscription plan this last year directly before I would have been charged again for my subscription. As many are aware, COVID has affected nearly everyone‚Äôs hours at work and I am unable to afford this now. Apple has refused a refund to me on the grounds that I paid for a yearly subscription (not true). As such, I will no longer be utilizing the app for my meditations and instead will be using only the web browser. 

The second issue I have been having a problem with is that no matter what I do the meditation or sleep sound will cut out after a few seconds, and refuses to play. This has gotten extremely frustrating. I have installed and uninstalled the app. I have had my phone looked at, I have tried it on my iPad. Nothing. This is more than likely a programming issue, but I won‚Äôt be worrying about this after I delete this app. 

Overall, it‚Äôs a good app. The meditations are helpful and it‚Äôs very easy to use. However, due to the expenses I have had to deal with for something that I paid for two years ago I will be deleting this from my phone. If or when they have the app supporting the subscription that I had paid for I will be more than happy to continue using the app, but at this time I must put it down.",1,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

They make really good animations to show you so you can visualize what they are talking about. Also at the end of the day you can‚Äôt expect great things to be free. I mean if you wanted a free meditation then there is youtube? But in my opinion head space is there $13 a month or $65 a year. And when you break it down the value for that price is so cheap.

REFUND,False,JDYGLS,2020-02-08 15:25:12,"Refund. This is crazy. This App will withdrawal $69.00 from your bank account as soon as the free trial is over. I didn‚Äôt use the free trail, didn‚Äôt even log in. I asked for a refund. The costumer service is awful. They sent me an email saying that due to high volume they could not help me for 2-3 days. Really? High volume. Then another option was to go to the App Store, who I thought they for sure would have my back, they are the ones that have my credit card on file and they hold a very trustworthy position. But, as soon as I sent a request for a refund from the headspace app, they denied the refund within seconds . Appalling customer service.

Plus I get charged not only another year but at their highest price at $95.88!!! I read on their website says the automatic renewals (which I believed to be cancelled) would be at half that amount.

Life Changing,False,kyle_seau,2020-02-02 09:06:38,"I started my headspace journey seven years ago (wow!), and I could not imagine my life without it. My therapist recommended headspace to me when she presented two options to manage my anxiety; 1. Meditate or 2. Medication. Given that I was 21 years old,  I decided to try meditation because i wasn‚Äôt ready to be on anti anxiety medication for (what may be) the rest of life. At first headspace was hard, I felt mentally tired ALL.THE.TIME! It‚Äôs like exercising a muscle. If you feel this way don‚Äôt give up, make time for yourself because once you exercise that muscle more the tiredness goes away. Throughout the seven years, some months I would ‚Äúfall off the headspace wagon‚Äù but I eventually would get back on. Having headspace these past seven years, has eliminated my need for anti anxiety medication. 

No matter where you are in your headspace journey, I recommend making time for a little headspace everyday. It‚Äôs worth it, and you deserve it!",5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
