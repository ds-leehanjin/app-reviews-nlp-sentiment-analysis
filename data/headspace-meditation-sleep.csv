"It‚Äôs almost embarrassing to say this, but I have been a ‚Äúmeditator‚Äù for about 30 years and I have to say that I never really got very much out of doing it.  I tried so hard, but I‚Äôm finding out I never truly understood that ‚Äútrying‚Äù to be a good meditator or mindful person, was missing what doing this was about.  What I‚Äôm learning through this app is that ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù is about me - understanding myself first, and it‚Äôs a lot about acceptance.  So with that understanding and acceptance I can begin to see ‚Äúthings‚Äù so much more clearly and why previous ways of thinking, particularly about myself, were holding me back from living my life and loving myself.  And I‚Äôm finding that the more I practice self acceptance, the fears about living fully and going after what I want out of my life, are disappearing.  
The previous version of myself is rapidly becoming someone I only used to know, and this new ME is much more in line with who I‚Äôd always wanted to be.  I‚Äôm able to try and do so much more, all while in the comfort that I am lovable, even if I fail at something.  I simply dust myself off and try some more.
This app has completely changed me and the way I‚Äôm able to appreciate all the good that‚Äôs in my life.  And I‚Äôm worthy of going after the things I want for my life, while freeing me up to share my gifts with others and society in general.

"I discovered Headspace on Netflix. My life is a series of invitations to succumb to fear. My husband is a practicing psychologist who is on peritoneal dialysis for 10 hours every night and works remotely with patients for about 10 hours every day without complaint. We have been waiting for a kidney for two years. I am optimistic by nature but even if this was the only focus for concern it would be a lot. Unhelpfully, the list goes on with equivalent issues. I can‚Äôt work; I need to be on call because I am the go-to for support. I occupy my mind and time writing a book and renovating every room of our home one at a time amidst being available for nine blended (mostly grown) children and 5 grandkids, many of whom have special needs. I am busy but isolated like so many due to covid-19. Trying the Headspace series felt like meeting air; filling the natural and effortless need to breathe. It has provided me with a new lens through which to focus on challenges and see potential. I incorporate it into my waking routine at dawn and it positions me for whatever happens throughout the day, and differentiates a space that is my own. I turn 61 this month and for maybe the first time in a while, life feels lighter and brighter. It‚Äôs not about what you fear or can‚Äôt control or even the fact of fear. It‚Äôs about the lens through which you interpret your fears or challenges and making them your strengths and allies.

"You won‚Äôt regret buying a Headspace subscription. I often joke with people that Headspace is the one thing I would want to take with me to a desert island. If I were to cancel all of my subscriptions today, Headspace is the one exception I would make. I‚Äôm a high school English teacher, and our administration put together a month-long mindfulness education program for our students shortly after I subscribed. I had already raved to many of them about the app and the benefits of taking a couple of minutes out of their day to sit and be present. Lo and behold, Andy pops up on the next slide as our Ted Talk speaker of the day! On a more serious note, I suffer from debilitating chronic pain. I‚Äôm currently on long-term disability and a leave of absence from the classroom. Mindfulness, and the courses on managing pain, have been a tremendous help in my journey. Not only that, but I struggle with insomnia. My favorite part of Headspace, because of my (admittedly) vivid imagination, are the sleepcasts. I love falling asleep to Rainday Antiques. I can‚Äôt imagine doing anything but that ever again. I have learned to manage stress and anxiety in a way that I had never thought was possible. I have meditated in the waiting room of The Cleveland Clinic before my appointments. I once laughed at the idea of mindfulness and meditation. Now it‚Äôs an integral part of my life.

"This app has given me tools to deal with constant change. This past year, I‚Äôve needed to pivot every day to face some new challenge outside as an essential worker, and at home in isolation with my partner. The tools I Iearned to use to be present in the moment and to accept change has benefited my partner and colleagues at work as much as my own peace of mind. I have very little control over my environment, but I can see my reaction, accept the emotions that rise up, and move on instead of getting lost or bound by them.
This app has also benefited me by helping me get through insomnia. Sometimes it helps me get to sleep in the first place. Mostly it gives me tools to use to calm my mind and body when I wake up in the night buffeted by anxiety or lingering frustration from the day. 
Lastly, this app has given me a language to express the emotional upheaval and troubling questions that I used to just call anxiety. Naming what makes me feel upset has brought clarity to what can feel like a tempest at the time and allow me to look at my thoughts or, rather, face them. After acknowledging them, I can let them go. Sometimes I‚Äôm better at that than at other times. 
Regular exercise strengthens my focus, my ability to pivot and refocus, and builds roads of calm and quiet that the brain finds easier to fall into and travel due to constant use.",Kindly38,The most useful thing I‚Äôve done in 2020,2021-01-18 17:14:21,False,5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
"This app has helped me so much! When I am suffering from stress, health anxiety, or fibro/stress related body pains I turn to this app and go through some meditations with the teachers. It‚Äôs an excellent way for me to relax. Calm my mind. Stop thinking about myself. And to recover in the moment. Hopefully in time this will help me heal, as previously I‚Äôve just been getting worse and worse without any therapy since my therapist‚Äôs practice permanently shutdown from COVID. This has been a great help and is something I can just pull out of my pocket and sit in my bedroom for a bit to calm down. Well worth the 1 year subscription price I‚Äôve paid.

*There is only one thing that I‚Äôd change. This would be for some of the workout audios. I need to walk a lot for a heart condition I have (which is a big cause of my health anxiety), and I‚Äôd love to see the audios for walks and runs to be a bit longer. The longest run audio I see is 20 minutes, when recommended cardio workout lengths realistically should be at least 30 minutes. I‚Äôd really like to have an audio similar to the bedtime audios that are lengthy, have soothing talk, and tips to reduce anxiety made to be listened while walking. And if there could be a variety to choose from. Overall this would be the only change I can think of. An hour long walk audio to help calm my mind. üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è",jlhuggins,It‚Äôs a Miracle App!,2021-02-08 19:19:10,False,5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
"I freaking love this app. My anxiety was starting to become bad again and I could feel myself falling into depression. I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness and it‚Äôs helped me in the past but I‚Äôve never been able to stick with it for more than a couple of weeks at a time. Then one day while listening to Huberman‚Äôs podcast there was a month free trial and I decided to try it since I‚Äôve always wanted to give this app a go anyway. WELL, let me tell you...this app is changing my life. I am proud to say I am on my 33rd day streak. I can feel myself overall being more present and aware throughout the day. Now, when I start to feel anxious I almost immediately catch myself and can begin using some of the tools and practice I‚Äôve accumulated from headspace. I do want to add though, the key word is PRACTICE. Medication, like Andy says, is a skill and like any skill you must practice. By practicing enough, it does truly become second nature. I know it‚Äôs only been a month but I can already feel the difference and I am looking forward to the future. Thank you headspace team. P.S every little thing about this app is great. I especially love the different courses, the wake ups, the animation shorts, the sleepcasts, the focus music and yoga.",Discosuperflame,Grateful for headspace,2021-04-28 14:52:38,False,5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
"I heard about this app on tv and saw ads in The Today section of the App Store. I decided to give it a try and it really does help me out. I feel less stressed, calm, and feel ready for anything. It‚Äôs like a guide or tool which helps push you to be a better you. So then comes the question, is it worth it? I think so. For instance if you have ADHD or feel stressed most days (maybe because of work or school) use this. 

Everything is not sunshine and rainbows. For one, $13 to me feels somewhat pricey. Other meditation apps that I found are cheaper than what Headspace currently offers. Another thing is that it lacks free content. There‚Äôs only very little that Headspace offers and it‚Äôs not a lot. It‚Äôs almost as if your forced into paying for a subscription in order to use it. I really didn‚Äôt want to do that and I have now canceled it since I felt that it was overly priced. 

Headspace is great and I may say that‚Äôs is better than most apps I‚Äôve used. But I don‚Äôt like the fact that after going through the tutorial it locks most of the content Headspace offers you and forces you into a subscription that feels overly priced. Yeah, they give you a free trial but after that your pretty much forced. Offer more videos that are free and let people decide for themselves.

"So I‚Äôve been using headspace for quite awhile now and personally I think it‚Äôs great! But the thing is since I don‚Äôt have premium, I have to keep on repeating the same old things like the rain day antiques sleepcast I‚Äôve heard that sleep cast so many times and now I keep getting annoyed with it. That goes the same with the other sleep stuff too like the sleep music I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúdoze‚Äù so many times I wake up like every 30 minutes or so. Also goes the same with the two free wind downs. The first time I used the free wind downs I fell asleep instantly the second time after that I couldn‚Äôt sleep for ten minutes. So after that, I wanted to do a free trial for the premium but I didn‚Äôt realize I was short on money. Since most people do a free trial for like a week or so they cancel there payment the day before the payment is due. So I tried doing that but it asked for but then I realized they need to know my payment information before doing my free trial. I think it was because they don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna cancel my payment or actually do the payment. So yeah, I think this app is amazing it just needs to either lower down the price by like 3-4$ or maybe add one or two me free sleepcasts and same goes to the wind downs, and music.

"This is really helpful! The only reason I didn‚Äôt give a higher rating is because there‚Äôs a strong overlying tone of a sales pitch there. Which is unfortunate, because I think people would be able to see the value easier if there wasn‚Äôt a push for money after every meditation and for many of the things on the app people would want to explore. Kind of stalls progress of the meditation itself when you‚Äôve just worked so hard to pull yourself back, only to be instantly asked for money right after. From a company stand point I also think it would be more beneficial to work on building value and then freely offering the option to see what monthly costs are and also show a detailed description of what‚Äôs involved with a paid membership. I know this has worked well financially for other services and I‚Äôve seen increases in sales by simply looking at things from the customers perspective. And I feel like the customers perspective is a miss here :(
However quite and easy fix and overall this app is amazing! It not only teaches the basics of meditation, but teaches different techniques as well.

I travel quite a bit and I love that I‚Äôm able to pick my environment of choice to meditate. I always thought meditation meant quieting your thoughts etc... but when I learned that it was part of being mindfulness and being present in the now it helped immensely in my day to day well being. When I did the anxiety course that really helped in so many ways because I thought you could get rid of it. But learning to become aware of it and being present with it, I felt it wasn‚Äôt so much of a burden. I‚Äôve had trouble on and off sticking to it consistently but I‚Äôm trying it again. It‚Äôs nice to be able to have it there especially when I know how much of a positive impact it has had on my life.

"I downloaded Headspace when it was free for health care workers in 2020. I was pregnant at the time and was under a lot of stress at my job. I started with the pregnancy course on the app. This was so amazing. First of all, Andy‚Äôs voice is incredibly calming. Then the pregnancy meditation helped me feel closer to baby. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and when I was less stressed, my glucose was lower. This app helped me a ton with that. Then, when I went to my 29 week check up, I had just read a work email I was very upset about. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was high. They sent me to the hospital for monitoring. While I was there I practiced the meditation I had learned and was able to get my blood pressure down so I could go home! The meditations also helped me get through labor!

"In my abnormal psychology class we learned anxiety is not just a fight or flight response but instead can be a future oriented response. Abnormal anxiety usually is characterized by presenting when there is no real danger. Therefore when I lay down in bed to sleep and I start getting an increase heart rate, feel extremely hot and sometimes nauseous at the idea of future situations and work that I have yet to do, it‚Äôs abnormal. Even if many people experience this is is abnormal because there is no real threat just my brain over thinking future situations. Therefore on my quest to look for ways to relax my mind before bed I downloaded headspace. I usually listen to a guided meditation before bed. Followed I will set one of their sleep music for 60 minutes and lay down. I now am normally asleep before the sleep music stops. Even though in my class we talked more about biological and psychological treatments, I felt as though there might be an easier way for me to deal with this anxiety.

"I give this app 5 stars because the build of this app, the contents of this app, the flow of this app is great. well done. Every app can be improved and this one needs work in some ways 1. the watch app: the only thing I every get on the watch app is a 1 minute ""breath mini"". the watch app is basically useless. Why can't I see my today screen on the watch and start my various mediations from the watch. the watch app gets 1 star. 2. Shortcuts: on the iphone I have setup a sleep schedule. On the ""good night"" screen I am given the option to run shortcuts. Headspace offers a few shortcuts that can be called from this screen. One is the nightly ""sleepcast"". the sleepcast is supposzed to be different every night. It is different on my today screen, but the shortcut always plays the ""Rainyday Antiques"". therefore the shortcut is useless. this part of the app gets 1 star. Lastly, the philosophy behind this app is mindlessness. It is taught as a universal fix for bringing the mind to a place of ease. As such it is a religious philosophy. I think they need to be more open about this and they need to state that the point of this is to alleviate suffering.

"I signed up for my free trial in fall 2019, at the recommendation of a family member. I thought it was great, but wanted to shop around and see what all of the individual meditation apps had to offer, but Headspace is the clear winner. I signed up for an annual subscription (and I hardly ever do that). The general organization of the interface is great in its simplicity, because you can easily toggle between the app‚Äôs different features with the navigation on the bottom, and there‚Äôs only five options so it‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing to me. Speaking of aesthetics, the graphics shown while meditating are very uplifting, simple, and non-intimidating. I think apps like Calm that have the ability to show/do nature sounds are cool, but that feels like too many decisions as to what graphic to choose. The soft Australian accent that Andy has is very calming but feels more non-judgmental, like an old friend who‚Äôs just being your guide through the meditation.

I have a couple suggestions: When a sleepcast ends, can it just skip to the next sleepcast (or at least have that be an option in settings?). Also, I can only fall asleep to male voices, so I‚Äôm very limited to a few sleepcasts.. it‚Äôd be great if all stories were recorded by both a male and a female and we could choose which we‚Äôd like to listen to. Lastly, I really would like a setting where we can skip the breathing wind-downs. If not, then at least have a trigger where when you‚Äôve already done 1 wind-down, then the next sleepcast you listen to should automatically skip this part.

I feel more agency over my mood and internal well-being. My wife has commented many times on how present I seem (and how grateful she is for that!).

Headspace Move, the exercise program, focuses on a mindful approach to physical exercise, something I had never experienced before, and it has added a good deal of joy to my physical routine. The video production and design work are outstanding, as is the coaching. I do wish, however, that there was a bit more emphasis on form throughout the workouts ‚Äì if I did not have previous experience with some of the exercises, I might be a bit lost as to how to do them properly and without risk of injury.

We are all better humans and we create a better world when we all meditate. 

I want to give this app a 5 star rating, but there is one fundamental flaw. If you get any text or phone call during your session, then the audio stops - even on Do Not Disturb mode. You essentially just sit in silence for another 20 minutes wondering if you should break meditation and check your phone - which can be a really frustrating experience. It sometimes ruins the meditation itself because you run over your scheduled time for meditation. You don't get that gentle opening of the eyes and reflect on your feelings - instead you might end up angry that the session was ruined. 

I want to continue to support this wonderful program, but after almost 400 sessions, I am considering quiting my subscription and using a regular timer instead.

To capitalize on the lack of mindfulness/the need of people in a modern society that is sick and distressed and disconnected in order to make money is sickening in my opinion.

And you could organize it so that you can find the free options easier without having to scroll past 30 locked meditations that aren‚Äôt available unless you pay.

I think there‚Äôs something for everyone‚Äîregardless of background‚Äîto benefit from in the app. My partner and I enjoy doing meditations and Move exercises together. They seem to always be adding more and improving in ways that I previously had silently wished they would. As for possible improvements, I‚Äôd really like to be able to ‚Äúshuffle‚Äù or choose a random sleepcast, specifically. Also, it would be nice if I could rewind the sleepcast, as sometimes I miss the beginning or certain parts while I‚Äôm settling in, or still have stuff on my mind from the day and don‚Äôt want to go through the whole wind down exercise again. Another suggestion‚Äîand this may just be an issue with my older Apple TV‚Äîif I could airplay the video along with the audio (Move exercises, The Wake Up) that would be fantastic as right now only audio plays on the tv while I have to watch the fitness instructor from the phone.

"I have had a subscription to this app for a very long time. I first started using it for sleep.  I could never fall asleep... I would toss and turn for hrs, sometimes all night and not even get a min of sleep. This was extremely frustrating and it was affecting many aspects of my life in a negative way.  I have chronic back pain, and I could never get comfortable, so I thought about this pain all night. My mind racing, knowing that I had work in the morning and I was just miserable.  So, I started using the wind downs.  I incorporated that with a beginners course on meditation.  After some time and practice, I was beginning to see real improvement.  Then I added the sleep stories, I didn‚Äôt think they would work at first, because I believed that the story would have me too focused on the story and not fall asleep. Again, after a week or two, I was falling asleep before the story ended.  Then I did the pain course...to help me understand my relationship with pain.  It did wonders. Over months I was dedicating at least one time a day to meditation.  I also have anxiety, and have been working on that.  But there is so much more on this app. Yoga, healthy eating, music, and a lot of helpful info and meditations.  I have tried other apps while using this one. Some were pretty good and some just weren‚Äôt for me. This app is honestly an app I can‚Äôt live without.  I love it!  I am living a healthier lifestyle and also sleeping so much better. I recommend this app to ANYONE & everyone.  They add new courses and different aspects to it all the time.  I will NEVER cancel this app.  I have begun to look at life different. My mood is more positive, I am focusing more, and I encourage anyone looking for a place to start a meditation journey to start with this app.  There‚Äôs so much information and I can‚Äôt go a day without it.

"My son bought me Headspace for my birthday ü•≥ last year after I had talked with him about a perceived crisis I was having. My son is 38, I am 68 and we are very close. He said ‚Äúdo you meditate?‚Äù I thought then said ‚Äúwell no I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start.‚Äù When my birthday rolled around he told me he purchased a year of Headspace so I could learn to meditate. That is the most thoughtful gift üéÅ I have ever received. I was feeling like I was having a meltdown starting on the inside, so I started the impermanence process. My day starts better with the little bit of time I devote to myself. There are many issues I am working on and the more I examine the list in Headspace I see they have a session for each issue. I am certainly on a journey that is aiding me with the tools and skills to manage issues better. I use to have a difficult time getting to sleep and now I put on Rainday Antiques to help me sleep and I have yet to hear it to the end... I am sleeping very well. With the discipline of having the breathing to center me and give me a moment or two to get a perspective rather than react I feel much more in control. I am so not there yet (where ever there is üòÇ) and I feel that Headspace will always have a session for me on this wonderful journey my son gifted me.

"Headspace‚Äôs meditation teachers taught me so much about mindfulness and I‚Äôve been mediating afford two years as a high schooler. And Andy was a former Buddhist monk, so I learned sooo much about mindfulness that it‚Äôs improving my quality of life A LOT. There are so many things I want to say but I want to keep this short. Even though mediation sounds ‚Äòdumb‚Äô for some people, Headspace is the very opposite; it gives me mindfulness tips and follow up with a mediation, making the mindfulness lesson more memorable, and what I learned so far (and all of them are so freaking helpful) are: observe thoughts instead of reacting and getting carried away with them, if we‚Äôre reacting to thoughts we are keeping the emotion alive, adding more fuel to the fire; let‚Äôs thoughts come and go, with a gentle or effortless focus; having a daydream sense of mind let‚Äôs us take things less seriously and it gives us more freedom, and sooooo many more (I can‚Äôt remember all at the moment). But some improvements I‚Äôd want to see are: being able to review the daily mediations in the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù tab, because they are so freaking useful and I want to keep listening to them, I don‚Äôt want them to be just ‚Äúdaily‚Äù, I want it to exist in the library forever; another improvement is that it‚Äôs kind of expensive for high schoolers, and since I‚Äôm a high schooler and I think this app should be used more by students, I think it should have a reduced price for high schoolers as well (thankfully I got a free one-year trial and I‚Äôm waiting for the sale, because I‚Äôm paying using my own money).",Kid backwards,"Sounds cheesy but this changed my life, and it still continues to as I use it everyday",2021-06-15 01:49:50,False,5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

"I have heard of apps similar to this one before and figured I would give it a try to relax me since with finals are just around the corner and deadlines are getting closer. I decided to put my goal at reducing stress and anxiety and the first thing I got was  prompoted to a ‚ÄúFeeling overwhelmed‚Äù talk down to get myself relaxed and calm. The voice was not all that calming and relaxing, but he did have an accent that was very mesmorizing that helped let go of some tension. 

After setting some goals for myself Headspace created a list of things for me to accomplish throughout the day and the first thing was to take five deep breaths. What I loved about this was the music was very calming, but still had some upbeats it helped with when we were holding, breathing in, and exhaling. Another great component was there was a little face that would do the exercise with you and when you would inhale it would smile.

The way this app relates with anxiety and panic attacks is, I think this can be beneficial to help get our heart rates down, get us to focus on other things, and help us relax. I think this would be incredibly useful in situations of discomfort of nervousness, I know this would help me and many others. Breathing methods help center us, by doing the five breaths with the app helped me feel more in control and calm of what I was doing. I have shared this app with my family, as I know they have been going through some hard times lately and they could use something to relax and destress them. 

Stress can be hard to manage, and a lot of the talking ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù seem to help with trying to get you to let go or trying to find other things to distract ourselves with so we dont become too overwhelmed. Overall, I think this app has some benefits it helps calm you, center you, and puts you at peace. It certainly helped my anxiety be more managable while doing assignments and it helped me get in the right direction for the next couple of hours with my work and overall wellness. I can definitely see myself using this in a store to distract myself from my anxiety because this type of stuff can be grounding.",kireahm22,Good app,2021-04-17 23:09:02,False,5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

"Was thinking of giving it 1 star‚Ä¶ below is why‚¨áÔ∏è

Headspace is truly a wonderful app.
It has evolved through time with new features made for every kind of person. New high quality content is constantly added. 

I started meditation and mindfulness through Andy‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúHeadspace Guide To Meditation and Mindfulness‚Äù and it was a game changer. Eventually I downloaded the app and, sometime after, I started paying annual membership. I do so without regret because of what the app offers. The opportunity to access guided meditation by teachers such as Andy is incredible!!  Everyday life is a fight, the world is going fast, our lives as well‚Ä¶for me, the app has become an necessary aide for motivation and resources. 

Precisely this is why I almost gave it 1 star. Everything is so magnificent it has generated dependency.  It is so good, that now it seems very difficult for me to meditate without it. It is as if I‚Äôve lost my ability, will, and/or discipline to acquire headspace on my own. Makes sense? Maybe. Foreseeable? Most likely. Inevitable? Not really. Could be just me? Definitely. As of writing this comment, I will actively work to put in practice meditation and mindfulness on my own again.

My advice for anyone reading the review is to go for it. Try it out, learn the basics and reap the benefits !!!  but be careful to practice being present and dealing with your mind without having to use the app. I believe the app can‚Äôt become essential in our lives.

"Headspace is a great supplemental tool to use if you‚Äôre looking for emotional and physical well-being whether you‚Äôre having a typical bad day, you‚Äôre having trouble sleeping, or you‚Äôre having a major life crisis. Of course it‚Äôs not a cure-all, but I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs a help-all. It‚Äôs helped me in managing anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, grief, loneliness, being over-excited for events, ect. It‚Äôs even been of one the tools I use to calm my mind and help prevent migraines if I feel a small one coming on. 

Personal experiences:

One night, back when I was pregnant, I was panicking from the grief of my mother dying of brain cancer, and that night I felt I could barely walk because of the overwhelming emotions I was having, but prayer and headspace helped me calm myself enough to function again that night. 

When I moved to a city after living my whole life in rural areas, headspace and prayer were what helped me overcome the feelings of being trapped and anxious. I started out with the free trial which was great. Then I was gifted the premium and I enjoyed that, though I wish it was always free ;). I‚Äôm back to the basics now, and it is still helpful.

Overall, headspace has helped me calm down on a regular basis to levels I didn‚Äôt think were possible for me. Headspace along with counseling have led the way for me to overcome negative thought patterns I‚Äôve had my whole life. 

Headspace has taught me mindfulness meditation and helped me accept myself and appreciate my present reality. These techniques has showed me how to be as calm and clear headed as God intended when he created our bodies and minds to have those calming mechanisms such as deep breathing and visualizations already built in. Headspace can just help you discover those. 

Headspace changed the way I help myself and my children cope with strong emotions. It‚Äôs helped me be more present and grounded in my own life, and that‚Äôs huge for me.

"I should have reviewed this app years ago. 5 stars for sure. I‚Äôve recommended it to so many friends and have given it as a gift many times as well.   

I took a hiatus much of this last crazy year (ironically when I prob needed it the most) and when I recently came back, I see the total redesign with a ton of new content. So now we are scrolling through all this content, tons of media, noise, and suggested to set a myriad of notifications?!  Is this conducive to a quiet mind? No. In fact, every time I open the app I end up feeling super anxious.  I thought it was a one off, but it‚Äôs happened each time. It‚Äôs too much noise and it‚Äôs too chaotic at the time in the morning when I‚Äôm trying to start my day off right by focusing on presence, quieting the mind, and setting my intentions before leaping into my crazy day.  Now, instead of being a respite, a place for grounding, this app mirrors much of what life looks like these days and all social media apps.  Honestly, this really feels like Headspace ‚Äúsold out.‚Äù

Once you dig around and find what you‚Äôre looking for, Andy‚Äôs soothing guided meditations are still there, and I do love the ambient noise and low-fi tracks that have been added. I get it. You‚Äôre trying to corner the market on all things zen. Gotcha. There‚Äôs a BD team making very different decisions than our beloved yogis and zen masters. So....

In the spirit of both staying true to the mission AND in consumer satisfaction (which is of course, good business) I will offer the perfect solution, instead of canceling my membership (yet) bc Andy is the best. Create a customizable home page. Let me drag over only the things I want on my page.  It would be what I see when I open the app and no need to navigate elsewhere if I don‚Äôt want to.  I would personally choose to keep it uncluttered and super simple with my mediations and maybe some music. Others may do something diff. To each their own.   And when I‚Äôm not in mediation mode, maybe then I‚Äôll choose to dig around the other media and content to check out your new stuff, and drag and drop new favorites to my page.  But opening this app and seeing this chaotic stream of content is not sustainable for me, and I cannot imagine that I am alone in that.",D in NYC ,Have loved for years but not the new 2.0 version,2021-03-11 14:17:37,False,2,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,"{'id': 21637993, 'body': ""Thank you for your feedback and we're sorry for any trouble navigating the app. If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to our team at help@headspace.com.

"I was watching YouTube on my iPad,  (As Usual) and it was almost time for bed. Then, an add came up for headspace. I looked at the reviews and then I decided to give it a try. My favorite noises include: The Ocean, Forests, And The Rain. I turned on the ocean, and I closed my eyes. The next thing I know, It was morning!

"Headspace is a great app but it‚Äôs just so extremely expensive. $12.99 a month? That‚Äôs as much as Netflix, which has a ton more content and Netflix‚Äôs content costs millions of dollars to produce. I know the same isn‚Äôt true for Headspace

If you pay a year in full the price goes down to $5.99 a month. It‚Äôs more reasonable but I don‚Äôt want to pay a year in full. Even then, it‚Äôs pricy

I think I would pay $4 a month for headspace. That seems like a fair price to me. We‚Äôre not all rich",msrubbertson,Good but insanely expensive,2021-01-27 14:28:59,False,2,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,

"Thank you to all who worked to make the app a possibility. I recommend this to anyone at any age to be quite honest. There are so many options depending on what your need is. Whether you want to work on mastering stress, or dealing with anxiety to wanting to be more positive. It all ties together. I was in a very dark place, but thanks to Andy and his team I‚Äôve been able to steer in the right direction over and over again.
