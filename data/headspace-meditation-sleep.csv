I tried so hard, but I‚Äôm finding out I never truly understood that ‚Äútrying‚Äù to be a good meditator or mindful person, was missing what doing this was about.  What I‚Äôm learning through this app is that ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù is about me - understanding myself first, and it‚Äôs a lot about acceptance.  So with that understanding and acceptance I can begin to see ‚Äúthings‚Äù so much more clearly and why previous ways of thinking, particularly about myself, were holding me back from living my life and loving myself.  And I‚Äôm finding that the more I practice self acceptance, the fears about living fully and going after what I want out of my life, are disappearing.  
The previous version of myself is rapidly becoming someone I only used to know, and this new ME is much more in line with who I‚Äôd always wanted to be.  I‚Äôm able to try and do so much more, all while in the comfort that I am lovable, even if I fail at something.  I simply dust myself off and try some more.
This app has completely changed me and the way I‚Äôm able to appreciate all the good that‚Äôs in my life.  And I‚Äôm worthy of going after the things I want for my life, while freeing me up to share my gifts with others and society in general.

2021-02-12 12:42:11,"I discovered Headspace on Netflix. My life is a series of invitations to succumb to fear. My husband is a practicing psychologist who is on peritoneal dialysis for 10 hours every night and works remotely with patients for about 10 hours every day without complaint. We have been waiting for a kidney for two years. I am optimistic by nature but even if this was the only focus for concern it would be a lot. Unhelpfully, the list goes on with equivalent issues. I can‚Äôt work; I need to be on call because I am the go-to for support. I occupy my mind and time writing a book and renovating every room of our home one at a time amidst being available for nine blended (mostly grown) children and 5 grandkids, many of whom have special needs. I am busy but isolated like so many due to covid-19. Trying the Headspace series felt like meeting air; filling the natural and effortless need to breathe. It has provided me with a new lens through which to focus on challenges and see potential. I incorporate it into my waking routine at dawn and it positions me for whatever happens throughout the day, and differentiates a space that is my own. I turn 61 this month and for maybe the first time in a while, life feels lighter and brighter. It‚Äôs not about what you fear or can‚Äôt control or even the fact of fear.

If I were to cancel all of my subscriptions today, Headspace is the one exception I would make. I‚Äôm a high school English teacher, and our administration put together a month-long mindfulness education program for our students shortly after I subscribed. I had already raved to many of them about the app and the benefits of taking a couple of minutes out of their day to sit and be present. Lo and behold, Andy pops up on the next slide as our Ted Talk speaker of the day! On a more serious note, I suffer from debilitating chronic pain. I‚Äôm currently on long-term disability and a leave of absence from the classroom. Mindfulness, and the courses on managing pain, have been a tremendous help in my journey. Not only that, but I struggle with insomnia. My favorite part of Headspace, because of my (admittedly) vivid imagination, are the sleepcasts. I love falling asleep to Rainday Antiques. I can‚Äôt imagine doing anything but that ever again. I have learned to manage stress and anxiety in a way that I had never thought was possible.

This past year, I‚Äôve needed to pivot every day to face some new challenge outside as an essential worker, and at home in isolation with my partner. The tools I Iearned to use to be present in the moment and to accept change has benefited my partner and colleagues at work as much as my own peace of mind. I have very little control over my environment, but I can see my reaction, accept the emotions that rise up, and move on instead of getting lost or bound by them.
This app has also benefited me by helping me get through insomnia. Sometimes it helps me get to sleep in the first place. Mostly it gives me tools to use to calm my mind and body when I wake up in the night buffeted by anxiety or lingering frustration from the day. 
Lastly, this app has given me a language to express the emotional upheaval and troubling questions that I used to just call anxiety. Naming what makes me feel upset has brought clarity to what can feel like a tempest at the time and allow me to look at my thoughts or, rather, face them. After acknowledging them, I can let them go. Sometimes I‚Äôm better at that than at other times.

The longest run audio I see is 20 minutes, when recommended cardio workout lengths realistically should be at least 30 minutes. I‚Äôd really like to have an audio similar to the bedtime audios that are lengthy, have soothing talk, and tips to reduce anxiety made to be listened while walking.

I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness and it‚Äôs helped me in the past but I‚Äôve never been able to stick with it for more than a couple of weeks at a time.

Now, when I start to feel anxious I almost immediately catch myself and can begin using some of the tools and practice I‚Äôve accumulated from headspace. I do want to add though, the key word is PRACTICE. Medication, like Andy says, is a skill and like any skill you must practice. By practicing enough, it does truly become second nature.

I feel less stressed, calm, and feel ready for anything. It‚Äôs like a guide or tool which helps push you to be a better you. So then comes the question, is it worth it? I think so. For instance if you have ADHD or feel stressed most days (maybe because of work or school) use this. 

Everything is not sunshine and rainbows. For one, $13 to me feels somewhat pricey. Other meditation apps that I found are cheaper than what Headspace currently offers. Another thing is that it lacks free content. There‚Äôs only very little that Headspace offers and it‚Äôs not a lot. It‚Äôs almost as if your forced into paying for a subscription in order to use it. I really didn‚Äôt want to do that and I have now canceled it since I felt that it was overly priced. 

Headspace is great and I may say that‚Äôs is better than most apps I‚Äôve used. But I don‚Äôt like the fact that after going through the tutorial it locks most of the content Headspace offers you and forces you into a subscription that feels overly priced.

But the thing is since I don‚Äôt have premium, I have to keep on repeating the same old things like the rain day antiques sleepcast I‚Äôve heard that sleep cast so many times and now I keep getting annoyed with it. That goes the same with the other sleep stuff too like the sleep music I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúdoze‚Äù so many times I wake up like every 30 minutes or so. Also goes the same with the two free wind downs.

Kind of stalls progress of the meditation itself when you‚Äôve just worked so hard to pull yourself back, only to be instantly asked for money right after.

 I love this app and I would recommend it to lots of people!

 I came to this app for sleep help got a subscription and got what I wanted. They gave me real ways to help me sleep. I realized that was meant for meditation I ended up getting dragged into the meditation part and now I love the app so much! 

My constructive criticism: 
I mostly use the app for my sleep. I would like in their surveys for them to give something about what stress is most is to take into account not everyone who is using the app is a true adult and not everyone is actually doing work. I think I would say it‚Äôs causing the most stress is school for me.

1) They are not releasing daily meditations anymore. This was extremely valuable, and they‚Äôve replace it with something called ‚ÄúThe Wake Up‚Äù which is very hit and miss.
2) They have gotten somewhat political. I understand that brands need to stand for what they believe in, and all that‚Äôs great. But in a world where politics is now everywhere (in sports,movies,social media etc) Headspace always felt like a refuge, like a place where you could tune out all that external noise and just breathe and relax. 

In conclusion, point number one is the biggest reason i gave it such a score now, but point number two is also worth mentioning.
I hope they bring back the daily meditations with Andy.

I would toss and turn for hrs, sometimes all night and not even get a min of sleep. This was extremely frustrating and it was affecting many aspects of my life in a negative way.  I have chronic back pain, and I could never get comfortable, so I thought about this pain all night. My mind racing, knowing that I had work in the morning and I was just miserable.  So, I started using the wind downs.  I incorporated that with a beginners course on meditation.  After some time and practice, I was beginning to see real improvement.  Then I added the sleep stories, I didn‚Äôt think they would work at first, because I believed that the story would have me too focused on the story and not fall asleep. Again, after a week or two, I was falling asleep before the story ended.  Then I did the pain course...to help me understand my relationship with pain.  It did wonders. Over months I was dedicating at least one time a day to meditation.  I also have anxiety, and have been working on that.  But there is so much more on this app. Yoga, healthy eating, music, and a lot of helpful info and meditations.  I have tried other apps while using this one. Some were pretty good and some just weren‚Äôt for me. This app is honestly an app I can‚Äôt live without.  I love it!  I am living a healthier lifestyle and also sleeping so much better. I recommend this app to ANYONE & everyone.  They add new courses and different aspects to it all the time.  I will NEVER cancel this app.  I have begun to look at life different.

Even though mediation sounds ‚Äòdumb‚Äô for some people, Headspace is the very opposite; it gives me mindfulness tips and follow up with a mediation, making the mindfulness lesson more memorable, and what I learned so far (and all of them are so freaking helpful) are: observe thoughts instead of reacting and getting carried away with them, if we‚Äôre reacting to thoughts we are keeping the emotion alive, adding more fuel to the fire; let‚Äôs thoughts come and go, with a gentle or effortless focus; having a daydream sense of mind let‚Äôs us take things less seriously and it gives us more freedom, and sooooo many more (I can‚Äôt remember all at the moment). But some improvements I‚Äôd want to see are: being able to review the daily mediations in the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù tab, because they are so freaking useful and I want to keep listening to them, I don‚Äôt want them to be just ‚Äúdaily‚Äù, I want it to exist in the library forever; another improvement is that it‚Äôs kind of expensive for high schoolers, and since I‚Äôm a high schooler and I think this app should be used more by students, I think it should have a reduced price for high schoolers as well (thankfully I got a free one-year trial and I‚Äôm waiting for the sale, because I‚Äôm paying using my own money).",False,"Sounds cheesy but this changed my life, and it still continues to as I use it everyday",Kid backwards,5,headspace-meditation-sleep,493145008,
