‚Ä¢In-Depth Mood Tracking and feelings log
‚Ä¢Health Habit Tracking (Sleep, meals, exercise, etc.) and this even has the option to make custom bad habits like nail biting or smoking.
‚Ä¢Specified anonymous forums/group chats for peer-to-peer support with many different struggles 
‚Ä¢Automatic weekly check ins (short quiz to determine levels of anxiety, depression, etc.)
‚Ä¢Small library of great meditations for various situations you might be facing. 

... and as usual, more premium features are available for a subscription. Even though subscriptions are available and recommend, I have used this app for six whole years and never felt like I was lacking the tools that this app provides to help improve my life.

There are so many different parts of the application that at first glance and the first time I experienced using the app, I felt overwhelmed with the amount of information, which is its biggest weakness. However, there are more strengths than weaknesses. For example, there are so many features and tools one can use, including guided meditation, health log, hope log, thoughts journal, goals log, and guided journeys where users can interact with other users. Upon signing into the app, users are required to answer questions so that the app can cater to the users‚Äô specific needs, mental health issues, and other issues one might be having. Sanvello is very secure, I feel safe and protected using it as they would not share my information because it is completely confidential. Another great aspect of this app is that they can connect/match users with life coaches and therapists, which may be intimidating and difficult to find elsewhere, if one doesn‚Äôt have any direction or guidance as to who they can seek help from. In addition, I like the images, icons, and colors used in the app is it is welcoming and calming at the same time. Although Sanvello has a wide age range starting from 12 through adulthood, I think encouraging adolescents to use this app can be beneficial for them. Overall, I believe Sanvello is an app‚Äôs usage for adolescents should be encouraged by social workers, teachers, parents, and other adult peers as it can help teach them how to learn, identify, and regulate their mental health while feeling supported by professionals and other peers that are feeling similarly to them.",2020-09-06 19:34:17,Great App for Mental Health,4,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861

The rating is based on numerous strengths and weakness the app exhibits. Sanvello lacks important substance, the therapy option on the app is unavailable in many states. With that, Sanvello also does not provide service for individuals with impairments and disabilities. The app also has mediocre guided mediations when comparing to other applications. Sanvello does display strengths including, their easy to navigate design. Uniquely, the app promotes a variety of features that help users achieve their mental health goals in comparison to other mental health apps. Sanvello also offers the ability to connect with a community of users to form a safe space to feel supported. Comparatively, Sanvello should not be considered a substitute to professional mental health treatment. However, when the app is used as a part of a self-care plan, the app can be vital to prioritizing one‚Äôs mental health. During adolescence development one begins to face individual stresses including, school pressure, friendships altercations, relationship struggles, family hardships, and irregular sleeping patterns‚Äîthe way teenagers cope with these stressors shape the individual (Laser & Nicotera, 2010). Correspondingly, Sanvello has multiple features that allow adolescents to develop and cope with significant stressors they experience daily including, journaling, meditation, and monitoring sleeping habits. The accessibility of these features and the permission to access peer-support on Sanvello can help guide adolescents on their identity process. Social networking site and applications benefit teenagers to learn and develop self-control, to respect to individuals‚Äô viewpoints, to engage in critical thinking techniques (Murphy et al., 2013). The app provides a variety of suggestions and skills based on adolescent‚Äôs mental health struggles and development, ultimately demonstrating appropriateness for that particular age group.",2020-09-05 01:27:51,App Store Review,4,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861

Sanvello has been one of the best apps I‚Äôve reviewed so far. First off , the guided journeys are very helpful and beneficial , they‚Äôve also helped me with my mental health too. Also , if the guided journey hasn‚Äôt been helpful , you can rate it when it pops it. 

Features
The group chats and discussions and great. Plenty of people to chat , vent , give advice to and so much more. There hasn‚Äôt been a single mean or rude person on there because everyone on Sanvello is going through the same thing. The journal types are very detailed and clear , and the mood entires can be very helpful if you just wanna let your feelings out , but not in a direct way. 
Also , it tracks your progress and gives you a weekly check-in to let you know how you‚Äôve been doing. If you need anything , you can email them and they will respond very quickly! I‚Äôve had some issues with the app in the past they responded within a day or so.

Flaws & Things to Improve 
Sanvello is a great app , but it has its flaws and imperfections like anything. There‚Äôs probably features and bugs that need to be addressed , but I‚Äôll just say the ones off the top of my head. You get free Premium access when you start , then it puts you back to the free Sanvello app. I‚Äôd wish they would tell you that it switched back ‚Äòcause it got really confusing for me. The prompts or formats of how some things are written can get confusing on that app. For thought records , guided journeys , e.t.c. It cuts off links sometimes. In group chats , it can cut off the links which can get annoying.

I‚Äôd strongly and high recommend Sanvello to anyone who‚Äôs going through a rough time , has mental health issues , or need a group of people to relate to in a really tough time. Thank you to all the readers to took the time to go through every word.",2020-08-27 04:13:55,"Without a Doubt , 5 Stars",5,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861

But recently I‚Äôve moved out of my parents house and live across the country, completely out of reach of them. I got a job, a place to stay and I live on my own and the days started to get repetitive and tedious. I started to feel sluggish, unmotivated, and even, I dare say, a little depressed. 

I started calling off of work simply because I didn‚Äôt want to get up. I‚Äôd stay in my bed all day until the urge to pee started to hurt, and all I wanted to do was nothing. I had lost all motivation to do anything. I felt awful. My usual tricks of telling myself to ‚Äújust be happy‚Äù or smiling to myself stopped working. So I felt like I needed an outside source to help me. 

That‚Äôs where I found Sanvello. And to be honest, a lot of the tricks they use, I already knew about and used on a day to day basis. Because a lot of it is just common sense psychology. Like reprogramming your brain by talking to yourself in a positive way, or forcing yourself do a task that will eventually lead you into doing more and more tasks. But for some reason the way they made this app works. And I feel a lot better after only 3 days of use.

False,,Wasson8r,"This app is above and beyond my expectations. I have seen big improvements since I COMMITTED to leveraging as much of the power it has to change me as I can.

The user interfaces are fantastic almost across the board. The notification system that helps you check in at somewhat random and key moments throughout the week to help create a clear picture with data is above reproach. The many and various tools cover a wide AND deep range and give the user a complete arsenal to combat mental health issues with the power to overcome and ultimately BE HEALTHY and maintain healthiness.

My experience has been phenomenal and I hope other people have the same or better experience.

All that said, no app is perfect for everyone. I don‚Äôt agree with the public forum setup, as I think that comments on other replies should be allowed, but I‚Äôm guessing there is good reason to not have that considering the door to toxicity is easier to shut down. I was also unable to report a user that needed to be reported and that was frustrating, but, again that may be because I was a new user and my power in the app was throttled to ensure trolls don‚Äôt come report people all willy-nilly. Forthright clarity if that is why would be helpful.

When writing review it is white text on white background.(Copy and pasting text from elsewhere made it black text on white background.)

The Basic free version help ends with no warning making me feel more abandoned.

Why can‚Äôt you get grants or donations instead of telling people they have to pay to live when they are at their worst? 

Ask for some of the INSANE amount of tax payer money wasted on weapons of war? No? 

Just going to continue to glorify BROKEN money?

Money means nothing without people. :/ :/ :/

I hate money.

Plenty of cultures are happy without money - $$$ doesn‚Äôt actually need to exist.

Why can‚Äôt the part of the app to be paid for be the interaction with doctors?

Poor people or those having trouble with insurance just supposed to suffer more?

The doctor that created insulin sold the patent for 1$ because ‚Äúit is unethical to profit off of saving lives.‚Äù 

Some doctors still today take whatever compensation people can give because they also think it is unethical to profit off saving lives.

Many parts of the app are pay only or insurance. Medical insurance is so broken and messed up that often makes me think they want me to die. 

Some parts that are paid only aren‚Äôt clear - don‚Äôt show desperate people what they can‚Äôt have is more humane.

Seeing posts of other users being happy is more depressing when depressed.

It doesn‚Äôt help to tell someone that doesn‚Äôt have friends or family‚Ä¶ to talk to friends or family. Some friends or family are what people need to get away from.

Many of the things the user has to reply ‚ÄúYep‚Äù to are too generic and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have another button or just do ‚Äúnext‚Äù and not have the user confused with something that they don‚Äôt actually agree with.

The ‚Äúhelps‚Äù or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt help‚Äù needs an unsure option.

 The one in which focused on thinking about positive memories very much was ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt help‚Äù it made me cry the entire time because I have no positive memories that aren‚Äôt corrupted with pain.

Feel dumb for telling someone this app helped when only a few days in going to delete it already.

Came to this app because I have no other options right now. All the other apps were completely horrible or pay only.

And no, I don‚Äôt agree that all people can control their thoughts with willpower and practice alone.

Great to know I fall in all the mental traps ‚Äú that aren‚Äôt based in reality.‚Äù :/ :/ :/ 

Few parts needed more examples or instructions instead of the user trying to point out which they thought was the case.",2021-06-27 19:08:01,:/,1,sanvello-anxiety-depression,922968861
