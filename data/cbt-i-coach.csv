4,"A free application with no ads! Yay for that! On a basic level it’s a really great application, providing opportunities to look at sleep and factors surrounding sleep differently. With a new view comes the chance to make changes to improve sleep and sleep satisfaction. I use this in conjunction with another app that helps track my sleep, which helps give me some of the info needed for my sleep diary. I have not started using several of the tools offered, but enjoy the sleep diary and graphs. I recommend this application to others. Thank you to the VA for making this widely available.

* Note to developer: Bug fix needed on the graphs. The numbers along the graph axis are not match up with the information put in the sleep diary. Ex. Went to bed at 0200h, but matching the data point to the left axis looks like I actually went to bed at 0300h. Otherwise graph points seem accurate relative to one another.",2021-03-13 21:01:06,False,Good App,67bigbee,cbt-i-coach,655918660
1,"All that entering in the sleep diary caused me to fret more about my insomnia. Nighttime awakenings increased in length as anxiety increased. The app is also like a scolding school teacher e.g. “warning!” “looks like you have insomnia (duh) talk to your provider”. Tells you NOT to look at the time but how are you supposed to know how long you were awake in the night (worrying about not sleeping)? If you have anxiety and some OCD tendencies, I cannot recommend this app. At all.",2021-03-01 17:36:01,False,Made problem worse,sssscari,cbt-i-coach,655918660
4,"When I try to export my sleep data I get an ""email not set up"" error, but see no way to set up my email",2021-03-27 03:42:41,False,Export broken,Daseisun,cbt-i-coach,655918660
3,Good app with all the data collected but the lack of integration with apps that actually track your sleep makes it tedious to have to fill in data points from one app to another. Publish an api to the app and let the sleep tracker apps integrate to it. Then it would be 5 star.,2021-04-26 03:53:12,False,Good App but lacks integration,ksshooter,cbt-i-coach,655918660
5,"This app is great when used along with Gregg Jacobs cbtforinsomnia.com program or his book “Say Good Night to Insomnia.” Same diary, calculators, content as the program.",2021-05-14 15:51:41,False,Great as part of full program.,cmelville,cbt-i-coach,655918660
