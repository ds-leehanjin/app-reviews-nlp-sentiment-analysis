4,"A free application with no ads! Yay for that! On a basic level it‚Äôs a really great application, providing opportunities to look at sleep and factors surrounding sleep differently. With a new view comes the chance to make changes to improve sleep and sleep satisfaction. I use this in conjunction with another app that helps track my sleep, which helps give me some of the info needed for my sleep diary. I have not started using several of the tools offered, but enjoy the sleep diary and graphs. I recommend this application to others. Thank you to the VA for making this widely available.

* Note to developer: Bug fix needed on the graphs. The numbers along the graph axis are not match up with the information put in the sleep diary. Ex. Went to bed at 0200h, but matching the data point to the left axis looks like I actually went to bed at 0300h. Otherwise graph points seem accurate relative to one another.",Good App,67bigbee,False,2021-03-13 21:01:06,cbt-i-coach,655918660
3,"I‚Äôve been using this for several months on my own as I‚Äôm not affiliated with the VA. I can not set the sleep prescription and when I try it has me waking and going to sleep at 12 am. On the home page I try to set the sleep prescription and am unable as I am told my sleep percentages are too low for the past week and I need to see a provider. We‚Äôre told not to look at the time we wake, but this is required for the tracking (how long were you awake). I can only see one week of data on the graph and so am unable to track longer periods of time to show patterns to the person who is trying to help me with sleep. So, the major functions of your ap are flawed. 

Being a mental health professional, I find the helps to be a very nice addition, but know that some of them aren‚Äôt appropriate for chronic insomnia. Sadly, I‚Äôm unable to find a compatible program that would allow we to download/view the sleep tracker information to share with a provider. 

This ap needs major work, but is the best free one I‚Äôve found to be available.",Sleep tracking portion needs major overhaul,thepurringdead,False,2020-08-28 09:42:47,cbt-i-coach,655918660
2,"1. It is impossible to forward a day to enter ‚Äúyesterday‚Äôs‚Äù nap on the day it is taken. Not helpful for people who can‚Äôt remember yesterday. If one has to make paper notes to use the app, what‚Äôs the point? 

2. Most of the advice is about sleep hygiene. Chronic insomnia is not caused by, nor cured by things like sleeping in a cool room.

3. If you think a worry time is effective for PTSD then you don‚Äôt understand PTSD. As usual this is just good advice for normal people. Sure think about how you can‚Äôt pay your light bill then stop thinking about it, you‚Äôll probably feel better.",Clunky technology and obvious education,Verity S.,False,2020-07-20 23:16:26,cbt-i-coach,655918660
2,"I‚Äôm a provider that does CBT-I and this app has so much potential. The Sleep Need Questionnaire needs to be added to assessments. There should also be an easy way to access average bedtime, sleep latency, awakenings after sleep onset, wake times, etc. Also, the sleep efficiency average given is total, not by week, and the graph does not expand/it‚Äôs too small to read exact numbers at each data point. It would be a much more useful, convenient app if it had these features. Hopefully they can make improvements soon.",Better than nothing but needs a lot of work,emilehman,False,2020-11-25 17:25:39,cbt-i-coach,655918660
4,"During a CBT-i course provide at the hospital, they suggested using this app to take my usage and compliance.  I have found this app very useful and easy to use. I‚Äôm grateful to have this on my iPad, it‚Äôs much easier to discuss my sleep patterns with my doctor with this tool. Printing a report is a major benefit for my.

1,My job begins at 1:30am. I tried to submit a sleep log off getting in bed at 6:30 pm and walking 3 hrs later unable to go back to sleep before getting up for the day at 1:00am. The sleep app thinks the wake time was for the next day and there isn‚Äôt any way to let it know it was for the same day. It will not accept the entry. So I can‚Äôt even begin to use the app because I can‚Äôt complete the first task.,Can‚Äôt even begin because it is too limited limited,Jfgjgdfbjffkjfsvnh,False,2020-02-24 05:51:25,cbt-i-coach,655918660
1,"All that entering in the sleep diary caused me to fret more about my insomnia. Nighttime awakenings increased in length as anxiety increased. The app is also like a scolding school teacher e.g. ‚Äúwarning!‚Äù ‚Äúlooks like you have insomnia (duh) talk to your provider‚Äù. Tells you NOT to look at the time but how are you supposed to know how long you were awake in the night (worrying about not sleeping)? If you have anxiety and some OCD tendencies, I cannot recommend this app. At all.",Made problem worse,sssscari,False,2021-03-01 17:36:01,cbt-i-coach,655918660

3,Good app with all the data collected but the lack of integration with apps that actually track your sleep makes it tedious to have to fill in data points from one app to another. Publish an api to the app and let the sleep tracker apps integrate to it. Then it would be 5 star.,Good App but lacks integration,ksshooter,False,2021-04-26 03:53:12,cbt-i-coach,655918660
1,This app doesn‚Äôt sync with Apple health.  There are also bugs. You can‚Äôt set a prescribed sleep or wake time.  It‚Äôs just defaulted to sleep time 12 am and wake time 12 am.  There is no way to change it.  There are many better apps out there.,Not so great üëéüèªüëéüèª Completely useless app,Beensbaby,False,2020-05-24 18:00:25,cbt-i-coach,655918660
