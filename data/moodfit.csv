2020-10-27 03:29:11,itskristint,"I have bipolar II & adhd. Regulating my emotions and organizing my thoughts can be extremely difficult at times. This app literally feels like a miracle. 2 days into my 7 day free trial of the membership, I was sold. I can track my moods and sleep, check off daily goals (and set reminders to do them!), see trends over time and see how they correlate with other variables, record thought distortions and challenge them, ground myself back from a panic attack, practice daily gratitude, and more. All that for $60 a year, that‚Äôs not bad at all. This app gives me the practical, tangible steps to take to become healthier and gives me the structure and encouragement I need to get there. Not to mention I had an issue with a function of the app and Ron, the CEO I think, emailed with me morning noon and night over the weekend to get it resolved. I‚Äôve never had that kind of customer service, seriously. Highly highly recommend this app. & it‚Äôs 1000% worth the paid subscription.

2021-01-03 20:28:01,KNE06482,"I love this app very much. I really like all the tools it has to improve mood. The primary reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five stars Hass to do with the accessibility with voiceover. Voiceover is an accessibility service that changes how the device works to help blind and visually impaired people like me use the touchscreen. In order for voiceover to work well, the app and the interface Hass to be programmed right. Don't get me wrong, because I do think this is one of the most accessible apps for mood out there, but it is lacking a couple of things with voiceover accessibility. For example, when I try to customize the days for a reminder, voiceover does not give me any indication of which days are checked off. For the days that are checked off for the reminders, why not have voiceover say something like M selected or M checked? That would give blind and visually impaired users an indication that Monday is checked off. Otherwise, everything else about this app is great. If it wasn't for the voiceover accessibility problem, then I would give this five stars.","Love this app but, ‚Ä¶",4,False,"{'id': 20562233, 'body': ""Thank you for taking the time to provide this feedback.
