2020-01-03 02:14:27,Great concept but needs Improvement,4,"I never review apps in the App Store but since this is an important app that does provide a vital service to people I thought I’d write in my experience with it so far.

I’ve been using Talkspace for almost a month now and I understand that the therapists on here also have their actual practice with in-person clients as well and I respect that they can respond to my messages whenever they get the chance but my first therapist would respond to me maybe a couple times a week at most so I ended up changing therapists and that was mildly annoying having to go through the reintroduction process with the new therapist all over again and explain what my problems/issues are and while she has been more responsive, I have had issues where my therapist and I would try to schedule my monthly live session and she never called/initiated the session at the agreed upon time.  I think there needs to be a way for the client to be able to try and initiate the live session at the agreed upon time or also have there be a way to kind of send over the messages to the new therapist when you try to switch therapists so you don’t have to start all over and spend your and hour new therapists time going over everything again.",False,Shawn Mahb,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
2020-01-23 00:48:31,I wasn’t so sure about this,5,"I am glad I gave Talk Space a try. It has become a vital part in my healing and rediscovery of self. Yes there is nothing compared to an in person human connection but this is a great alternative for those looking to save a little money and on a busy schedule. I can always find some time to send a quick “text” message or voice audio while I am at work or walking my dog. I like the options for voice messaging, text, pics and videos. I like sending my therapist photos of real people and things in my life (something I never did with an in person therapist). 

I did have some trouble when I first got the app. My first therapist was very non-responsive but Talk Space was aware and offered me the option to switch therapists so I did. Then I chose someone who told me up front she didn't work with certain traumas and I had to switch again but that felt necessary. I finally landed on an amazing psychologist who is very responsive even on weeks when I don't send anything she will kindly check in and let me know she is available. 

This app works great for me and my lifestyle and needs. You get about ten mins of talk time a day with your therapist about 5 times a week to equal the same time as a weekly therapy session. In the heavy unloading it didn't feel like enough but now that I am more stable and my therapist is updated on my basics it feels perfect.",False,Sage'sMama,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
2020-10-31 20:54:08,All this for one reply a day?,3,"The app isn’t terrible, it checks up on you, you can send voice messages, photos, and you can message your therapist any time. But I literally get ONE response a day. It used to be more in the beginning, when I stated that was a concern of mine, then when I re-upped for another 3 months, the therapist started responding much slower. Now even on their “days working” I won’t get a response. They really didn’t respond to me for 48 hours on their days working. I’ll have to ask if everything’s okay with them, since I don’t want to be rude, but they just don’t get the hint. How am I supposed to get help when I tell them something and they reply to it a day later? The constant, or rather 12+ messages it was in the beginning, was super helpful. Now I won’t be starting up again because I’m not paying all this money to not have a consistent talk. At this point, I should pay my friends because they’re doing a better job than my therapist. Only giving 2 stars because the app itself is easy to use and checks how you’re doing often, so it’s nice that they want you to progress.

EDIT- the company reached out to me to make it right. They offered a discount, or some money back. I bumped them up to 3 stars from the original 2 that I gave because a company that’s willing to return money or work with you is worth giving a try.

2021-01-09 19:17:33,I don’t see the point.,1,"I sent my first message to a therapist in early September. Waited 3 weeks. got no reply. Switched my therapist. Sent the same message to my new therapist end of September. Got no reply. I messaged talkspace to tell them I was disappointed. Deleted the app. In December  (over 4 months later!!) I got an email saying my therapist sent me a message. So I reinstalled the app. It was a generic message asking how I was doing but I was just glad to get a response. So I responded to the message. No reply for a few days. Then another message: ‘hi how are you doing?’ No response to the quite specific information I had given in my initial message or my response to the first one.. so I asked if this was a real person. ‘Yes my name is...*****’ then a few days later, ‘I hope you’re doing well’ so once again I responded with a specific response about how I was actually doing. Nothing. Days go by. So I tell the therapist ( and sent a message to talkspace support again)that I don’t see how this is supposed to be helping me or in any way construed as therapy and that maybe they don’t have time to take me on as a client.. Therapist then responds (very quickly this time) that they are so sorry but they are recovering from COVID. Wow.

Then you are locked into choice hoping person reaches out to you via text daily and video call weekly according to your insurance plan. If your therapist tells you to book next day, you can’t cancel less than 48 hrs without being charged for a no session (even if therapist cancels on you). If therapist chooses not to do video (so they can do other things while you are in a session like care for a baby) or decides to put you in speakerphone (a HIPPA violation of privacy), you’re out of luck (and sessions). Emailed “ticket” notes to TS is never answered until weeks later and they threaten to close the ticket if they don’t hear from you (no advance warning and no person our department to call). A waste of money and time as they use covid as an excuse to delay responding to your glitches joining a scheduled session due to technical difficulties. After over 1 month of trying to actually schedule a meet with someone, I gave up and TS charged my insurance for 1 session therapist canceled last minute and stated they couldn’t do on their end nor could they give me a session back.

2021-04-14 02:45:48,Therapists more or less phone it in,1,"I originally wanted to try talkspace because I have a tendency of running away after a few sessions. I thought the low commitment of talkspace might be helpful to me. Seems like low commitment is all you get from your therapists. I went through two different therapists that just wrote fortune cookie grade short responses that I’m sure they only wrote those so they wouldn’t get in trouble with talkspace as they’re required to respond to you in a certain time frame. I feel like that system is made with good intentions, but it seems seriously abused by the therapists. I absolutely would not recommend the therapists on this app. Your money is better spent on a REAL therapist. I’m sure the ones on here are better in person, but the system just makes it ripe for abuse.

The app itself is great to use and the user experience and onboarding process is great and welcoming, but that’s where the feeling of progress stops. The person who pairs you with a therapist doesn’t really care who you’re paired with. Therapists can put whatever they want on their profile and they won’t actually use their skills to help you. I literally received this advice by my therapist, “You have to develop some ways of calming yourself down.” I specially sought out a therapist that specialized in CBT. And asked what sort of techniques they might know. And I’m told to discover it myself.

2021-02-25 03:05:58,Mixed feelings 🙃,3,"Review for MESSAGING ONLY OPTION: 
   I typically don’t review apps, but this ones a little different. When I heard of this app and how convient it is supposed to be for you I thought I’d give it a try. It’s advertised as easy texting between you and a therapist, but it takes so long for them to reply :/ ( Ik they have other clients, but it shouldn’t say working now but response tmw)  that’s definitely not what I was expecting when I downloaded the app. I saw a few other reviews saying the same, that therapist only reply once or sometimes twice ( which it does say in the informed consent you agree to when you are matched with a therapist).
   While that consent does say if you want to schedule with your therapist a time for “real-time” instant responses, you can do so; when I asked my current one if we can do that she basically turned it down to say that she thinks it’s better for me to have a relaxed space to type, even though I rather the instant messaging back 😕. 
    I had high hopes for this app but I don’t think I’ll be renewing my subscription, unless it dramatically changes over next few weeks, especially with its cost & late response, for example: You text at 3pm, and you’ll get a message similar to... “expect a response by tomorrow at 3pm” type of thing.",False,AZ 🏜,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 21351620, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review.

2021-06-02 02:01:38,"Great idea, very poor execution",1,"I loved the idea of Talkspace but I was a bit apprehensive as I was reading the reviews. Many people said they never heard back from their therapist and had to find a new one multiple times.  I eventually decided to download it but unfortunately, my experience was exactly the same. I haven’t heard from my therapist and it’s been well over a week since when I’ve initially contacted her the first time. I’ve done in person therapy and I thought I’d be a great candidate for TalkSpace. It’s ridiculous that you pay upfront for these services when a response back from a therapist isn’t even guaranteed. With the money I already paid for the month, I could have had 2 in-person one hour sessions (and I would pay AFTER these services were provided). I’m holding this platform to a higher standard because you all are offering therapy services to people who are requesting help. It’s really unfortunate that more often than not, people aren’t hearing back from their therapists. I’m not even going to try to find another therapist because I don’t want to waste another week of my time retaking the questionnaire/matching with a new therapist/ waiting for their response. It’s unfair to expect users to wait 2-3 weeks of their first month just waiting for a first response from anyone.

2020-12-27 19:37:04,Requires you to review your old therapist before trying a new one,3,"I started talkspace in early November 2020 to try to cope with 2020. After a few weeks I wasn’t really feeling it, but I wasn’t sure if it was me, or the format, or the therapist. I decided to try another therapist before cancelling. The ads make it sound super easy to change therapists, and it kind of is, but the process requires you to give a rating and review to your current therapist first. I didn’t feel comfortable with this because I had no idea if my therapist was good at her job and didn’t feel qualified to rate her at that time. Customer service said they could help me but I don’t want to talk to CS every time I want to change, either. I don’t know what the solution to this would be, since I assume they need this information on the back end, but it makes me super uncomfortable,  and ultimately resulted in me cancelling my subscription today because I wanted to change again but did not want to rate a stranger’s job performance nor explain to a customer service agent why I want to change and why I don’t want to leave a review.

They coax you in with a very kind matching agent named Laura. She’s quick and caring and gets you to drop the money quick. Of course, if you’re struggling with mental health issues and needing help on a budget you’ll do what it takes. Then they match you with a therapist and tell you they’ll respond within 24 hours. The guy I chose never responded. So I went to search for a new therapist and was brought to a new matching agent named Holli Fiscus-Connon who took 20 minutes to respond and was so cold and uncaring. Short answers. No apology for my disappointment. Simply said “I found you a new match”. I clicked and what do you know...ITS THE SAME GUY THAT NEVER RESPONDED! I told her that it’s the same guy and that I felt disappointed and requested a refund. Without any remorse she just told me to message customer support. Cold, nonchalant, indifferent. Turns out she’s a therapist too! Who are these disconnected therapists that treat peoples problems so casually? It’s totally unacceptable.

2020-12-16 15:02:07,Pricey Alternative,2,"First and foremost I’d like to say that talk space was VERY easy to use, easy to navigate and the response time for getting connected with someone to match me with a therapist that fit my needs was quick and efficient. I have nothing bad to say about my limited experience with the app. That being said, let’s talk price. I’ve been in therapy since I was 10. After years of 280 dollar sessions with my therapist, my parents must have been financially exhausted. After insurance no longer covered some of the cost for me, I had to step away from therapy, my medication was no longer available, and my mental illnesses grew worse and worse. Talk space, though it may be a convenient and useful tool for those too busy to go to therapy or those who do not have an office readily available to them, is not a better alternative financially. It’s VERY expensive. Like 60 bucks a week expensive, or more if you choose a package not as limited. So please be aware of that, and if you can afford it then I suggest you give it a shot. I didn’t make it past choosing a plan so I can’t speak for the level of experience of the therapists or the interactions I may have had. This is just a review on price.

My therapist on here is AMAZING. Love her! However using TS as a platform has been horrible.

What broke the straw was needing to refill an Rx for an antidepressant. My therapist is saying TalkSpace won’t allow her to call in a refill without a checkin appt. the app is saying I need to pay $125/for a 30 min check in to get even though my insurance has verified more than once that it 100% covered. So here I am about to run out of my meds and there is no way to call anyone at TalkSpace, my therapist can’t call in my Rx, and so I’m stuck choosing to find a new doctor?! Or pay $125 out of pocket?! Wth. My insurance also told me they’d received several calls about this exact issue with TalkSpace. 
This is a SERIOUS issue folks. Messing with people’s ability to get access to their meds is not something you can chalk up to a “glitch” in your app.

I felt that getting the account up and running through my insurance was more of a hassle than it needed to be (I told a co-worker that our insurance covers a Talkspace account and she said she got frustrated with the sign up process and threw in the towel) but I stuck it out. 

Once I was up and running, assigned a therapist, and completed some basic intake, I was free to utilize the app. I reached out to my therapist explaining in detail why I was seeking help. My first response actually asked me why I was there so I copied and pasted my original message again. Responses seemed to come once every 12-24 hours the first week but they seemed extremely short and pointless. After about 3 weeks with my therapist I had only received 11 messages and came to the conclusion that my therapist ghosted me so I requested a new therapist. As of today, he has been ignoring me for close to a business week. I reached out to customer service and asked them to cancel my account due to terrible service...I’ve been waiting a few days for them to cancel it...

For $260, I was hoping I’d get immediate responses to anything I might need help with not I text my therapist and wait for when they can respond. Possibly hours or even the next day is when they would respond, by then I had already talked with someone else and I felt like I just wasted my money on someone who only has time for me twice a day. And for $260, I would expect to be able to video chat with my therapist but no. If your plan doesn’t have that feature, you must pay $65 for one video chat. And I believe that’s for the week. So just to use this app you’d need $260 but can’t forget the additional $100s on the side you would need to actually see your therapist. Not to mention that it’s hard to try to seek out other therapists because once you’re matched that’s it.

However, I felt like I was in constant therapy mode. To get your money’s worth, you will be messaging your therapist one day, 5 days of the week. So while it seems cheaper than normal in person or live therapy, the amount of time they spend writing an email length response mashed up for the five responses in one week is equivalent to one in person therapy session. Personally did not work out with my needs. I did have a great second therapist! The first one, I wasted 2 weeks of my subscription waiting for a response but she never contacted me back.

2020-11-04 21:57:41,Horrible experience did more harm than good.,1,"Seeking out therapy is a difficult step in itself. It starts by admitting to yourself you may need some help from a professional. I started talking to my therapist Sean on October 13. He was unable to attend any of the sessions I booked on his ""open"" calendar through the talkspace platform, and blamed his inability to sync his personal calendar with his talkspace calendar on glitches in the system. I finally had one 60 minute session with him where I confided some of my most personal issues.

I cancelled my service and request a full refund. I would NEVER recommend this service. If you’re considering it, read the most recent reviews.

I was in a deep depression and couldn’t make myself leave the bed to do anything besides work and then I’d come straight home, so I thought this would be a great option for me. I was wrong and could have been dangerously wrong because I really needed help and I did not get that with talk space. The therapist I was matched with did not respond to me like she was supposed to per the package I paid for so I requested to be switched and they acknowledged my request but did not switch me. I tried to get what I needed out of it but all it felt like was trying to talk to someone who responds to you once every day or every other day so you aren’t really getting anywhere because it takes a whole month to even explain what’s going on. I should have been switched when requested, even the therapist admitted she was too busy to respond appropriately.  It was a waste of money I wish I would have spent elsewhere.

I have learned that at least for me, it is preferable in every conceivable way to receiving traditional therapy in terms of the insights it generates, the sense of having made human contact, accessibility, ease of use, and seemingly quality control. And trust me, I’m a piece of work, so if it works for me compared to normal therapy, where has this been since the invention of broadband and why didn’t I come up with it? You can even see your psychiatrist in the same app, and easily schedule appointments with both folks and put it straight into your calendar. Tired of typing? Sending a video or voice recording.

The quality of therapy is subpar which is really damaging bc if you’re anything like me, mental health is serious, and a bad experience sours my ability to seek help. If you have more serious symptoms and mental struggles, I don’t recommend trying Talk space.

My first therapist was ok, but our communication style wasn’t a good match. When I poured out my feelings and more serious side effects of my anxiety to him, he just honed in one innocuous detail (nail biting), and suggested an old wives way to stop. Like Yes, I appreciate the suggestion, but if easily Google-able methods of stopping nail biting would’ve worked for me, I would’ve stop 10 years ago. He failed to even acknowledge anything else I wrote.

My next therapist ghosted, she didn’t respond after 24-48 hours. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt before requesting that she respond, and when I did, she responded with a short reply that left no way for me to add to it.

He constantly missed/ignored the response time requested and to me who has mild anxiety issue it is very uncomfortable. He then missed sessions for the third time and that was when I decided to switch therapist. I had all my chat history transferred to the new therapist and then she complained it was too much to read. She was also insensitive to my culture AND she missed sessions. 
I’ve been writing to customer support for all these issues and it takes weeks for them to get back. What do patients do when we can’t reach our therapists and customer support can’t help?

It’s very disrespectful of people’s time and they need to acknowledge that access to therapy is not easy for everyone. Even taking a step to pursue therapy is a big deal, so they should make things easier by providing an efficient system for those who are able to utilize this service. 

Not only are there several problems switching between therapists and not getting a response from them, but Talkspace itself doesn’t even have a customer service phone number to reach out to. I don’t recommend spending any money on this service. I recommend that people use their health insurance to find therapists near them or search on Google.

I’ve been using TalkSpace for 3 months, 2 months were the 5 days a week option I had to drop Bc my insurance doesn’t cover it and it’s actually pretty pricy. It wasn’t until I suspended my account the SECOND time did I get the $50 a month, 1 day a week feature. Which is very affordable. 

My therapist is amazing.  I’ve read many reviews and I very well understand how rare that seems to be. She doesn’t respond right away, but I think she reads right away.  There seems to be a good ebb and flow to how she works. We’re still working out the 1 day a week flow, but the 5 day a week did wonders for me. 

I reached out in desperation, hopelessness, struggling to keep my head up. I felt that she took the time to understand what I was saying, what I needed.  She literally saved me. I’m staying on the 1 day a week option Bc guerrilla therapy (5 days) was great and got me to a good place, but I need to learn how to maintain and grow. 

The main thing is this, TalkSpace needs to change how they advertise. No your therapist won’t text back right away, I think it’s unreasonable to think they would.

She is warm, caring understanding and I’ve been so fortunate to have her there and an immediate bond where I felt I could tell her whatever parts of my life came to mind.  
She always replied with words that helped me to stop and think realizing her articulated sometimes brief sentences, said exactly what I knew inside yet never really felt I wanted to confront. 
I truly recommend Susan to anyone who needs a warm caring understanding and very helpful person in their quest for therapy for whatever problems or hurts they have.  
I feel I could text her forever and always only at my own pace which is so important as thoughts don’t always come about right away, sometimes one just needs to feel the time is right and it’s when Susan was the one I could turn to at my pace.

In a time when I felt incredibly vulnerable trying to open up to a therapist and really needed to talk to someone, the lack of help, communication, and transparency from the Talkspace team only added to my anxiety and stress.

The concept is fantastic and I was able to receive a full refund, as I was never even able to have an introductory meeting with a therapist.

It was like chatting with a person that talks about the weather instead of addressing to my problems. The follow up from her was also poor. After pausing the therapy for 30 days I decided to give another try and this time only I thought I had an instant connection with my therapist but....I scheduled three video sessions with her twice she DIDNT SHOW UP!!! later on she said she had trouble logging in. The other time when we re-scheduled for a later time that same day she was late for 15mins.....I came here to get help for one small problem and now I feel more angry and frustrated.

Then September came and something catastrophic happened. Now I go days before I get even one message from my therapist. I can only guess it’s because he’s been inundated with new referrals that he cannot accommodate? And because of that, I now never know when I’ll hear from him next.

2020-06-24 15:22:53,Seems very unfair to therapists,2,"In conclusion, this doesn’t seem to be a company that values its therapists. But therapy is powerful and helpful, regardless of Talkspace’s business model. 

I’m grateful because I was connected to a wonderful psychologist who helped me a lot for 4 months.

BUT, from my observation, Talkspace seems very unfair to therapist.

I know that my insurance paid $71 per week (audio and texting therapy, twice per week ). My therapist made $22 of that (We had some billing issues and I became privy to this information). I mean, come on!!! At least pay them half.

Why? 
1) they deserve it
2) it encourages high therapist turn over. It’s really devastating to a patient to have your therapist leave. Especially, as you can imagine, the patients that come on this platform.

Regarding the app, it works pretty well:

1) I wish it had a feature that kept your phone from turning off while you’re talking.
2) I accidentally pressed a button once and started a session with a new therapist. To backtrack, I basically had to leave a bad review for that therapist. That feels bad.
3) Fix the billing issues and make it easier for your therapists to get paid

Therapists are your bread and butter! Pay them well! Why would I want to continue on a platform where the person who I learn to trust and lean on is not being valued?

I am not discrediting breathing exercises or the practice of CBT. I find it can be very helpful.

Talking about the death of a loved one or other large life events being met with an “I understand, I’m sorry.” To me personally seems so detached from the patient and their experience.

About the platform experience: My matched therapist spent the first two days describing her policies for when she checks and responds.

Now, three weeks into the process, I still have not been matched with a therapist, but I did lose $316 for nothing.

3) Advice for first timers; do research on the therapy methods offered before selecting a therapist. I went in blind and CBT wasn’t for me. They offered a different method, but it turns out in my case I just needed someone to listen to me. I worked out a lot myself, on my own. Verbal and written communication can be cathartic by itself.

If you are looking for real therapy, this app is not it. Unless you go for the expensive video sessions, I just don’t see this app helping at all. It’s more like a digital journal that occasionally talks back to you or like talking to a magic 8 ball.

The 10 minute intro session felt like being grilled at the DMV, the guy had to look at his notes to even remember my name and why I wanted to speak with him. Very curt and frankly unwelcoming, especially given the sensitive nature of the questions. 

The icing on the cake is the therapist then quit the platform a few weeks later, leaving me to start this stupid process all over again, which I’m not going to bother with even if it was free for me.

For starters, I don’t necessarily find the app to be user friendly. It isn’t the easiest to navigate if you want to figure out if you’ve scheduled any appointments or just want to poke around in settings. From there, the match coach isn’t much help. You’re given some options after taking a short assessment, but if you don’t find anyone you’d feel you can connect with, you can only see new matches two additional times before having to start the quiz over, Input all of your information all over again just to receive the same options as before. 

You can contact their CX team via the app which is great and after taking a loon I figured it would be a live chat but I shortly received an email notification stating I’d be contacted shortly. Not too sure why it would be set up as a chat interface if it isn’t that. I still haven’t received any information about any of the therapist I thought I scheduled (selected a therapist, date, time and all), no contact back from the matching coach, or from the CX team.

After that I was directed to the talkspace bookshelf and wasn’t really sure where to go from there. I was lucky to get a sentence or two a day from my therapist in response to paragraphs. I was also supposed to get a complimentary video chat that was never initiated. My therapist stopped checking in with me and I considered getting another,  but I figured it was better to cancel before the month was up before losing out on more money. With the pandemic going on I figured this was the only way to get counseling, but I’d rather wait until things open back up since this was more expensive and less convenient than actual in person therapy.

2020-08-25 00:21:03,Absolutely horrible,1,"Due to covid I was trying to do online therapy, but I have a particular disorder I need a therapist to have worked with before in order to help me. I was told it would be possible to find someone fit to me but that was not the case at all. The only specification I had was the person had to have worked with this disorder before, yet I was suggested what seemed like random people and none of them had worked with anything even close to what I was looking for. I was suggested a therapist that worked with male issues and I am a female, and one that worked with porn addiction which is no where even NEAR the other neurological disorder I have. When I asked if there was a way my marcher could recommend me more specific options she simply didn’t respond. I went through multiple pages of therapists and they got more and more random as I went on. The only person that could help me was my matches that had read my message and not responded for over 24 hours. I eventually asked again if there was a way she could help me refine the results and yet again she didn’t respond, the bare minimum she could have said was that it’s too specific for her to know. But radio silence from someone who is supposed to be a professional helping me is unacceptable. There is also no other way to find a therapist, and there is no way to switch even if they are not helping or responding at all. Eventually when I asked how to get a refund after her not responding to my past 2 messages asking for help she responded immediately but did not address anything from my 2 messages before that one.

2020-10-19 20:41:20,Definitely not worth it/made my anxiety/depression worse.,1,"I decided to get help with with some of my emotional issues. I was hoping to be able to just talk to a professional over the phone on my way home from work some days. This app is definitely not that. I didn’t really understand until I got into it but the cheapest plan they offer is $65 per week. This only includes two text messages a day from a therapist. So $260 a month to get 2 replies a day. There is also no guarantee that these replies are going to be at all helpful. I have heard maybe one piece of useful advice from a therapist on this app. I feel like I can pour my heart out to a therapist and then 4 days later(due to the therapist you choose only working a few days a week) I might get a message that says something vague like “what do you think makes you feel that way?” I don’t see how this app is helpful to anyone with a real issue with depression or that genuinely needs a person to talk to. The only way to get more interaction is to upgrade to their higher plans. Those can cost up to 400/ month. So then you basically get a few live video chats for a car payment. I  don’t know how expensive normal therapy is, however I feel I could pay anyone $400 per month and get more useful help than I have gotten from this app. I changed therapists because of some of the issues I have stated, and since I changed therapists on Friday I have gotten 1 message from her. She is apparently off on weekends, but here it is, 5pm on a Monday and still no sign of life that anyone is going to try and give me any kind of help.

2020-12-03 18:14:53,Terrible service,1,"Beware!  There seems to be no where to review talkspace besides the App Store,Otherwise I would not use this for him. The app is fine and works functionally. The therapist x 2 I have used have been great.  The talkspace service is awful. Customer service is awful and doesn’t reply to any messages or inquiries except for automated options.  I signed up and paid in advance for six months including one live session a week because it seemed very cost effective. The first month was great but then my therapist and I could never coordinate schedules for my live sessions. They appeared to be rolling over, so I wasn’t stressed.  After several months of only being able to coordinate a handful of live sessions, I decided I really needed to change therapists.  I reached out for advice from customer service on that and also whether my insurance would help cover some of the talkspace fees. Three messages to talk space and not a single reply.  I gave up trying and since I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings so I decided to put my therapy on pause and during that pause it appeared that my live sessions were on hold with it. The app actually show that I had six live sessions that expired after my pause ended. Everything came off pause in November, I had one life session and then the rest disappeared and even though I am paid in full through the middle of January,  it appears that I have no live sessions. Customer service will not reply to my inquiries. Basically I’ve spent nearly $1900 for a handful of text messages back-and-forth to a therapist and for live 30 minute sessions. It’s an incredible waste of money and frustrating to not have anyone in customer service communicate because everything is completely online through chat support. Well this is a great concept its functionality is limited and I suspect they grew too fast to really provide any sort of good service.

2020-05-19 15:25:47,Prepared to be ignored,1,"I’ve done therapy I’m the past and I found the first therapist I tried here to be decent and responsive except for a major issue I had with her so I had to switch. The next therapist saw my first message, sent me a test (Zanarini??? For borderline personality disorder??? I’ve already explained my dx to her which is PTSD only, as I have been treated with a psychiatrist for years) or at least I think that was her sending it. She never responded EVER as in never sent a text at any point. So I switch again after a few days and the next one has been my “therapist” for 8 days now and not once has contacted me even after I asked to get started and have waited 4+ days and still no response. So so far I haven’t had therapy for 2 WEEKS (but did for the first) and I have requested a refund for the last three weeks of the month because I did not get what I paid for on any level. I feel like even the first one didn’t take me seriously. I had been out of therapy for 2 years and was excited to get to work and now honestly I feel set back especially after how poorly the one time I talked about a recent traumatic event went.

2020-10-11 03:14:28,Not for BIPOCs,2,"I used Talkspace for almost two years, but quit the platform when my therapist wouldn’t stop harassing me when I tried to talk to her about my racial identity. When I asked, she told me she was qualified to talk about racial issues. But when I first raised the issue, her instant response was “All lives matter,” and “I am not going to talk about politics.” In the wake of the worldwide protests against racism, she tried to walk it back and said that she only said those things because she did not want me to take on too much for other people. She also said, “I am not racist.”  And, she said that I needed to apologize to her, because how dare I attack her and make all these assumptions about her. If this is not the textbook example of weaponizing white privilege, I do not know what is. I tried to go back to the platform to select a therapist that could work with me on racial issues, but there is no option for that. At the same time, Talkspace has touted itself on its Instagram and website as being aware and committed to helping BIPOC with issues related to race in America. (Which it only did in the wake of George Floyd’s death.)

I believe this is an important issue to raise because Talkspace is a mental health service, and mental health issues often affect BIPOC in unexamined ways. Further, I am a healthcare attorney, and I am acutely aware that BIPOC remain underserved in the area of mental health. 

All in all, I would not trust Talkspace to provide BIPOC the same level of care it provides its white clients.",False,TrueBlue2005,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
2020-09-09 23:27:32,Terrible and harmful customer service - they will rob you,1,"I don’t usually review apps, but I have to call this out to protect others. I’m not rich. Therapy is $$$. So I did one month of this talkspace during a crisis period in my life. I give two stars for my actual therapist who has nothing to do with the app itself. I wanted to cancel after a month and customer service took two weeks to respond, making me freak out that they’d charge me $400 or so, I had to freeze my credit card and pause my subscription to avoid it. Finally they reply offering me a discount, and I accepted that offer. But they charged my credit card actually MORE than the subscription- negating my discount and then some. I’m sure they’ll resolve it in two weeks but it’s already in my card statement, the damage is done.

Talkspace will repeatedly lure you into giving them your money and then not giving you value. I switched to a different plan mid-month, assuming that since I paid for a month in full already, the new, cheaper plan would take effect after the end of the current cycle. Nope. My therapist was like ‘well I’ll talk to you in a week!’ I was shocked. Customer service will of course take two weeks to reply like last time, so by then my plan will be expired anyway, making the whole exercise of contacting them pointless. I’m so so mad. They just take advantage of people!

Update: the second time they robbed me, they are also taking away time I paid them for therapy. I write to support every day for five days, no reply. They have added so much stress to my life and cut off my connection to my therapist. I paid for the time till September 13 yet after that I wanted to b downgraded my plan - they downgraded it right away last Friday. And I’ve lost two weeks of $$ I paid.

The entire intake process is strange and impersonal with a bot sending messages like “from everything we discussed, here are some therapists that would work for you” when I hadn’t entered any personal information. After being shown a few options you select a therapist. The first therapist I chose sent messages that were nearly illegible because of typos. I don’t care about occasional misspellings, but every other sentence she wrote had words that were clearly not meant to be in them and maybe autocorrect making it hard to understand what she was attempting to say. After spending a half hour looking through more therapists and choosing another person, I sent the new therapist information about what I was trying to get help with and I was met with a response that said that her responses will be similar to the last therapist I spoke to and that I should expect typos and if that’s not what I want I should go look for someone else. How is this acceptable? It only takes a moment to look back and make sure that your autocorrect isn’t completely changing the meaning of a sentence.

2020-02-18 03:17:55,Needs better therapist screening and matching,4,"REVISED FROM ONE STAR TO FOUR STARS.

Original Review:

I purchased a month so I’m using it, but the “therapists” are ineffective, giving platitudes and sophomoric responses.  I have gone to live therapy before, with some good and some ineffective therapists, but none as ineffective as this app or platform.  Really disappointing because it is a good concept.  But the fact is the responses I get sound like a mix of fortune cookie’s and a basic computer program based around a psych 101 textbook.  I do not recommend, I will be making sure not to renew.

REVISED REVIEW

Because I had the subscription through the end of the month I changed therapists and kept using it.  The new therapist is amazing, and the app has great functionality.

They need a better screening and matching process for therapists, because truly the first I worked with was absolute garbage at their job.  But this one is fantastic, and has been an absolute Godsend to me.

Also, there should be a better introduction or explanation on the way to use chat.  I have found it fantastic to like a journal.  This gives a nearly constantly accessible outlet for my crazy.  But unlike other journals, this one speaks back with issue framing, questions, and advice.  It took me a while to find my groove for using this app, but once I did it’s been really wonderful for me in my time of need.

Thought for developers: 

Instructional videos, or testimonials, talking about the different way people use the app, as to timing, writing content, etc.  Otherwise it’s counterintuitive, and it feels like you type a few lines, wait a few hours, get a de minimis response, and don’t make progress.",True,investorswastedmoney,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 13290623, 'body': 'Hi there, we are very sorry to hear about your disappointing experience.

2020-05-15 02:44:37,"Lower Your Expectations, I Was Left Hanging",3,"I’ve been with Talkspace for 6 months, initially on the plan without video, then I dropped to the once a week text plan about two months ago due to some budget changes.

I had two different therapists and I switched at the same time I switched plans. I wasn’t satisfied with the timeliness and/or quality of responses with either. Meaning, I either got more meaningful responses that took longer (no response from therapist in days at times during the everyday text plan” or less quality responses that were more frequent but seemed as a way to meet a deadline vs. genuine concern about my well being. 

I’m been in face-to-face therapy before and honestly, Talkspace doesn’t compare to that at all. It’s hard to either type out paragraphs of text to get a short response back, or wait to get a response. I think the issue is that from my experience, it has been extremely difficult to develop any type of inter-personal rhythm. Even dedicated response times were often missed. 

I ended up canceling because I felt that my therapist was too busy to respond. A sucky feeling when you are really in a place and your expectation is to receive a meaningful interaction at agreed-upon times. 

Honestly - my therapist asked me question “Is there anything I can help you with during our remaining time together?” on May 5th at 10:30pm. I responded the next day with a yes and some final guidance to set me on my way.  My message was never read nor responded to in 10 days I had remaining in my plan. I just wanted one response.

2020-12-29 19:31:37,Therapists are not as active as they say,3,"I have been using Talkspace for maybe 6 months. I have come to realize that it wasn’t just a problem with one or two therapists, every time I change therapists they are the same. 
They state they will respond back to messages everyday between whatever hours but then take days or I’ve even had it go a couple weeks multiple times, to the point that Talkspace says” the room has been inactive for 14 days” (something along those lines)

They seem to not put in much effort. That is pretty frustrating as the client, since I’m sharing my life story with them and it just seems as if it’s a side gig that they do not take seriously. 
We as the clients expect that these professionals will help us and not abandon us or leave us hanging which I sadly have felt with all of them. 
Even to the point that one of the therapists even messaged me randomly after I hadn’t heard from her in a while that “it would be best if I found a new therapist” out of the blue with no other information given. I thought that was very unprofessional when as the client, these people are hearing your vulnerabilities and they are supposed to be building rapport with you, but she just left with no explanation.
 Not a proper way to treat people who are trying to get help from trauma and other mental health concerns.

Pretty disappointed in the therapists that have been chosen. The therapists need to make it a priority to serve their clients in the same way they would their in person clientele. Especially now with the pandemic and people not wanting to be around others but still get help. This application would be great if that problem could be solved.

2021-01-07 16:07:11,Way Too Expensive For What You Get,3,"I love the idea of this app but the cost outweighs the benefits, and I say this as someone who loved the therapist I matched with. Paying $260 MINIMUM per month is ridiculous when what you get is someone who essentially replies to your texts once a day, multiple times a day if you're lucky, but usually only a handful of times per week. To my knowledge, there is no way to give ongoing feedback about the quality of your therapy to Talkspace--how often therapists miss their scheduled response should be displayed prominently somewhere!

Talkspace gives away free sessions and discounts like candy, which I appreciated at first, but at some point it becomes obvious that if they can give away so much free stuff then they are just wildly overcharging everyone to begin with. 

Also, half the features don't work! On multiple occasions I was offered a free week or 50% off automatically in the app, but nothing happened after I accepted the prompt. My guess is that's a coding/UI error, but it was incredibly frustrating to be constantly offered discounts that never materialized.

Bottom line is that this app is great if money is no object for you, and if you can tolerate therapy in bits and pieces over a long texting conversation (which I could not but that's my personal preference) rather than 30-60 minute substantive conversations. The app does offer face to face conversations but that means paying $400 (!!!!!) per month or $65 per session on top of $260 for texting, unless they accept your insurance, which seems exceedingly rare.

2020-09-30 15:30:44,A well-intentioned app with some downsides and tech issues,3,"I used Talkspace for a few months. It was my first foray into the world of online therapy services, and it definitely got me pointed in the right direction. My counselor was experienced and helpful, to an extent.

However, there’s a “once per day” response limit - i.e. once you’re done writing down your troubles, you let your counselor know and she’ll respond, once per 24 hours. I understand the point of this, but some other big-name therapy apps don’t have this restriction.

And, while my counselor was helpful, I could tell she wasn’t really engaged in my situation.  (This isn’t her fault - like I said, you can only talk once/day.) Some responses would have obviously typos, or be very generic, etc.

Also, I discovered last month that TalkSpace had overcharged me the tune of nearly $2,000. I canceled my membership at the end of March, but they continued charging me ~$260 per month for April-September. When I brought it to their attention they realized they had also double-charged me in March.

So, this is more of a tech issue than a complaint about the contents of the app. And, to TalkSpace’s credit, they immediately issued a refund for the full amount. But the fact that I would have essentially been charged $260 a month for the rest of my life, had I not noticed the charge on my bank statement and reached out to them, really put a sour taste in my mouth.

How is there no safeguard against this sort of thing? Does no one manually check to confirm that cancellations have gone through? My account showed the date that my subscription had ended - several months ago - so the app itself was aware that I had canceled. Combine that with the double charge in May, and it’s a serious oversight on their part that potentially isn’t limited to my account.

So, TL;DR: It’s a decent therapy app. It’s in the same price range as the other big apps, but has a frustrating once/day limitation. My counselor was good, but not great, and either tech issues or human error on their end resulted in me being overcharged neither $2,000. The refund was fast, but should never have gotten to that point to begin with.",False,Nnsbcjcjjjas,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,

2020-10-28 01:08:41,You might get a reply a day,2,"So I joined about 2 weeks ago and so far I wish I hadn’t because I haven’t had much in terms of therapy. They rarely reply and when they do it’s not much help. Not to mention that not every therapist has the same certification some are social workers/counselors I’m not sure if they mean schoolers or AA counselors. Honestly charging $200 a month for a couple of emails is crazy.
The first therapist I was matched to was nice but only replied to me once a day. Even though they says you get 2-3 replies. When he replied to me the replies felt kind of like self help quotes and he would say what I told him back to me. For example, if I said “I want help establish boundaries with my family because they do this, this, and this,” his reply would be something like “your feelings are valid and it’s important to establish boundaries”. I wasn’t sure if that was normal like in the beginning of therapy so I stuck it out for a week. 
Once a week passed I decided to switch therapist so I took matching quiz again, the people that were recommended were all social workers and didn’t seem to match any of the focuses i had selected. So I took the quiz again and got matched to more social workers that didn’t match any of my focus. I did it again and the same thing happened so I asked to speak with an agent. She tried to match me to some people but the people available weren’t much better, that’s when the agent explained that due to COVID they have been under staffed so at the moment they won’t be able match me correctly. I get that they are understaffed but they’re offering a service that’s pricy so they should make sure to have enough therapist available. I didn’t say this to the agent though because it’s not her fault it’s really talkspace’s fault. I eventually got matched to someone. 
Once I got my other therapist I was excited and asked her a couple questions. She took a day to reply to me and when I replied to her she never got back to me. I’m still waiting to hear from her. The first therapist at least got back to me by the end of the day but she takes one to two days to reply.

Update: I just switched again and my current therapist is much better and she does reply like 2-3 times per day.",False,I_Ronnic,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,

2020-07-22 17:08:49,Very Unprofessional,1,"This was a pretty miserable experience. My therapist sent me one text a day, asking for clarification on things I went into extreme detail about. Then she wouldn’t do anything with the extra information I gave her. She just moved on. I expressed frustration, but she made it seem like it was my fault, so I dropped it.

About two weeks I asked her to hold me accountable with some goals. I figure if she’s only gonna text me once, she can at least check to make sure I’m doing what I want to be doing, but she didn’t. She didn’t check on me for a week. And I really needed help during that week. What could have been a small conversation turned into me staying inside for 4 days.

This past week (our final week together), we’ve mostly been trying to schedule a video call because she has a different schedule than what’s on Talkspace and many in person clients who are clearly the priority. However, we weren’t able to figure it out and now I won’t get to use it. 

Additionally she never talked about making a plan based on what I told her. We never went over any assessments. (Besides her literally reading the results. I know what the answers say I wrote them.) Nor did we talk about the Talkspace program itself. So it looks like there are a lot of really cool features that I missed out on.

2020-09-16 22:56:08,I Couldn’t Get A Response,1,"I tried TalkSpace after leaving an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. I had an in-person therapist who helped wonders, but I just couldn’t afford it after my money ran out. I was hoping for an affordable option that could help when the panic attacks hit, and this sounded promising. I was able to choose a woman who specialized in abusive relationships and trauma and was excited at the thought of getting some sort of healing. Did I expect this to be just as great as my in-person therapist? Absolutely not. But I was definitely hoping to continue something, at least, to keep me going. 

I wasn’t able to get her schedule until I chose her and couldn’t go back. That was quite a bummer considering she was only available one day a week for two hours. And her responses to my texts? “You can do this... Keep going... How does that make you feel?... I know this can be hard, but you’re strong...” It felt like I was scrolling Pinterest quotes for an insane price. She would text me back only once and when I would respond quickly, I wouldn’t hear back until the next week. I didn’t even get her for those two hours. I’m past that problem, now my anxiety-ridden brain is onto something else since a week has gone by. She didn’t offer calls or video chats either.

I understand Talk Space is most likely a side gig for therapists who work full-time in an office, but holy cow. I felt worse coming out of it than going in. Lost my money, lost my time, lost my dignity crying over a phone waiting for a text back to make me feel better. Sound like a familiar scenario?

I try not to blame the therapist for a poor set up, but also, why offer potential life-saving services at two hours a week if they can’t be maintained? Maybe I got the short end of the stick. I only had a month to test it and then I had to pay full price. There was an option to try another therapist, but maybe there should be an option to not have to pay that entire price until you find someone you can connect with? When I had insurance, my EAP offered six free sessions per issue until I found the right person. And when I found her, I stuck with her until my money ran out. I don’t know, I’d like to think people would pay for it and stick with it if it meant saving themselves. 

Maybe offer tiers in pricing depending on what the therapist offers? If they only offer texting, of they offer calls, video calls, two or all three? I felt cheated to be expected to pay so much money for one text a week that never went anywhere. I haven’t checked TalkSpace lately, so I’m not sure if this part has changed. But that would probably make me want to check it out again with a new therapist that offered more than an inspirational quote they stole from a poster hanging in my boss’ office.",False,EnchantedTiki33,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 18099172, 'body': ""Hi there, thank you so much for sharing your experience, we truly appreciate your time and openness here.

2020-09-15 08:37:19,A nightmare for those seeking help,1,"I am a plan administrator, and made an effort to review the process for setting up an account and ensuring all went smoothly. 

First, the website directs you through multiple steps including getting your payment option for what I realized was not an agreed upon term for the customer. You haven’t chosen a counsellor, you’ve just entered in your information, including payment. Doesn’t feel good. 

Then I only received 2 options for counselors, one was not appropriate to my selected goals so I chose the other. It didn’t feel good. 

Then I tried to set a tome to meet this therapist, there were only 2 options, 10 minutes or 45 (not even the standard counseling session, considering they’re certainly charging $120 per week which which you could pay and see a counsellor in person for 55 minutes to an hour.) 

I chose 10 minutes and lo and behold this counsellor doesn’t even have calendar space and I get a message that there’s no availability for 3 weeks. Well, so I’ll be charged $120 a week to “text” with thsi person who I haven’t even spoken to or know will be a good fit, while I wait to have 10 minutes... that’s absolutely insane. 

This service either can’t keep up with demand or is just plain awful but even customer service to find reassignment was a huge pain.

2020-12-01 01:51:30,UNRELIABLE - DO NOT USE,1,"To start this off I really never leave reviews for anything unless I feel like it’s really a major issue that people beware of - It’s actually irresponsible this app is allowed to operate. Please avoid using this app if you need reliable help and here is why:

I’ve done in person therapy pre-pandemic so I know what it’s supposed to be like. Because of the pandemic I decided to give virtual therapy a try with Talkspace. The first issue is there were slim picking for providers - which is strange to me since it’s a virtual service it’s not like the provider has to be in your city, but this is minor. When I did finally land on a provider it was fine at first but then he very quickly became unreliable - which was the second issue. Some people opt to message throughout the week - I opt for the 60 minute session once a week. The provider was egregiously late on more than one occasion or would simply cancel at the last minute - which they charge you for anyways even if the cancellation is on the provider end. 

The third issue is there often seems to be glitches with the app itself or providers are not adequately trained in the interface or with the technology. There were several instances where I wanted to book another session with the provider and he simply wasn’t doing the after session wrap-up on his end to allow the app to provider another available session to book. I had to remind him of this several times until I eventually got tired of having to do this. There were several weeks where I would have booked sessions where I simply wasn’t able to do it was a very haphazard schedule. The fourth issue here is you are completely at the mercy of the providers schedule. They can either forget to allow you to book, or cancel a session at will with no consequences. In regular therapy this could also be an issue but when I had an in person therapist they almost never cancelled and were much more cognizant of my time and keeping a regular treatment schedule.

Once I realized this was actually mentally exhausting me I decided to switch providers to see if that would alleviate. The second provider was a no-show on the intro session. So clearly Talkspace isn’t really vetting providers well and definitely aren’t monitoring their service in any meaningful way. Which brings me to the final issue - there is no customer service number. Big red flag for any service. You cannot call and speak to a representation you have to submit a ticket with your complaint and wait for a response. This could take anywhere from a week to a month or more and from my experience it’s more on the longer side. I did it once and realized it was futile. 

In conclusion this app is terrible for your mental health actually. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone seeking reliable mental help especially if you’re desperate it would most likely push you over the edge. Not sure how the psych board lets this kind of malpractice fly - mental health is a serious thing.",False,sg2020nov,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
2020-06-27 13:22:38,Total SCAM,1,"I’m an ER nurse and single mom who was in between insurances. You got me to sign up for one price that I agreed to then overcharged me over DOUBLE the following month when I barely had time to utilize services. 

I’m also canceling because you guys have a poor app and poor customer service with no receipt of acknowledgement that a “ticket” or email was received with an anticipated response time. 

Don’t create an app to make money off of the vulnerabilities of people with no intention of actually helping, only getting paid. With the amount of money you guys charge and therapists you have I’d think you'd have enough to pay a human to sit behind a 1-800 number. Very disappointing because my therapist Danielle was phenomenal.

For anyone wanting to use this app: don’t fall for the “deal” they give you to sign up. Also don’t pay for the audio and video chat options at first unless you think you will utilize them. I paid for them and the options were never offered to me so it was a waste. Also, they want this review to be about my “provider” not any “app or site” issues lol because they clearly have MANY. They cost more than an actual therapist!

2020-07-19 22:09:19,Sad about this :(,1,"A good concept but a disappointing experience.

First, it is very misleading when it says 24/7 chat. Some sort of chat therapy would be a really great thing to have, but that is not talkspace. They should openly say that you will only get one message a day from your provider 5 days a week. This is not what I expected.

The first week is all just about setting up your therapy, and with one message a day and multiple forms to get through, this goes at a snail's pace. It feels as though the therapist are trained to drag out the set up period for as long as possible. So the first week is essentially wasted, but you are still charged for it.

 The other thing which seems unethical about this app is it constantly threatens you that you'll lose your therapist and never be able to pick them again. I feel that if this were a legitimate mental health app and you could not afford a therapist for a couple of months that you should be able to get back your old therapist no matter how much time has gone by. Your issues are personal and therapy is meant to build on your relationship with a therapist.  

*Edit* To their credit the support team did refund me which I am very grateful for. 

I found my therapist online which seemed like he had his own practice, but when I messaged him saying that the Talkspace format was not going to work out for me and that I wanted regular therapy sessions, he said he was sorry and that he could only offer therapy through Talkspace. 

This was just my experience with one therapist but it makes me question the credibility of the therapists on talkspace, I'm just not sure if they are real or not.

2021-06-01 04:32:26,No recourse when your provider ABANDONS you,1,"I had nothing but great things to say about talkspace and my therapist of nearly 2 years, up until recently... now, I would recommend that everyone stay AWAY from this service and this company, who doesn’t seem truly invested in mental well-being at all. 

Without warning, without indication she was taking time away, my therapist stopped responding to messages, there was no formal termination of care, and I haven’t been able to get ahold of her for 3 months now. I can see that she has “read” texts I’ve sent, but they go unanswered. She literally just ghosted on me. I am mentally vulnerable and was dealing with a lot during the Covid pandemic, self isolating for over 400 days due to being high risk. Talkspace doesn’t provide you with any sort of recourse for a situation like this. To make matters worse, there are apparently “no records” covering my care from my therapist, so if I wanted to change providers (inside OR outside of talkspace), I’m going to have to start from literally ground zero. Over 2 years of therapy on talkspace is over $5,000 worth of time that I have spent working on many topics with my therapist, and talkspace is not doing much to help me get my records (which are legally my property). This company treats mental health patients as if they are using a service like Uber. They don’t hold themselves accountable when things go wrong. I’m constantly told how my “concerns are being escalated” but nothing changes. Now, after being abandoned by a provider I trusted and worked with for 2 YEARS, I am afraid to trust another provider. It will take me months, if not years to recover from the trauma of being abandoned by my therapist when I really needed her. Talkspace offers me no solutions of how I can get my records or what I can do. There’s no consequence for the abandonment and I had to fight to get money back for the weeks I went without therapy. 
I’m disappointed— the concept could’ve been great, but clearly there is no protection for patients being really hurt when a therapist on talkspace fails to uphold their professional duty and obligations.

2021-06-03 18:27:22,Please read this before you use this service!,1,"I’ve never left a review for an app/service before, but I felt compelled to do so with TalkSpace because I fear that they are taking advantage of people’s mental health issues, especially amidst everything going on with COVID. 

I love the idea of Talkspace and think it could have been a perfect tool for me. Unfortunately, my first two providers took days to reply to my simple messages, and when they did finally reply, I was usually given an unhelpful and generic sentence or two. My first provider asked me what had and hadn’t worked in the past for me in therapy, and I said I didn’t care for worksheets. So she sent me…worksheets, ones that I could have easily found on the Internet on my own. And my second provider took so long to respond to messages that TalkSpace offered me additional free weeks of service. Seeing as the app has an immediate option to offer this kind of thing, I’m guessing they’re used to people complaining about providers taking so long. 

After my first provider abruptly left TalkSpace and my second provider stopped responding altogether, I found someone who I actually connected with. She said she was training to become a full-time employee of TalkSpace and I was excited to have more time with her. What I didn't know was that if I wanted to have that time with her beyond a quick message here and there, I had to pay $65 for a 30-minute video session on top of the monthly fee I already pay. Needless to say, I wasn’t going to do that. I'm not paying $200+ a month to get a one-sentence message every other day, and I'm certainly not going to pay more for a video session knowing that the quality of service will likely be lacking (if the rest of TalkSpace is any indication). 

I find it noble that TalkSpace wants to make therapy more accessible to more people, but I'm starting to wonder how much of that is just a facade to get people to cough up more money for a lackluster service. If you’re considering using TalkSpace, please know what you’re paying for. It is not traditional therapy, but rather a sporadic message here or there, with some generic worksheets tacked on. If you’re willing to pay for the video sessions, your experience may be better than mine. But this isn’t how you share therapy with the masses.",False,acrumbaugh,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 23268028, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review.

2021-02-15 19:51:30,THIEVES. They’re robbing me.,1,"I signed up for Talkspace in the beginning of January thinking Telehealth might be my best option. I quickly realized its not for me. I paid for the 6 month service to save money. If I signed up for a bulk of months, I saved like 30%. The total cost for 24/7 chat thread, 4 video chats a month and unlimited voicemail services for 6 months was $1896. 

They set you up with a matching agent to find out what kind of provider you're looking for. Great. 

The first provider I matched with ignored me for days and wouldn't confirm any of the video chat appointments I scheduled (and paid for with my package) which ultimately led to them being canceled at the last minute. I decided she didn't work for what I needed so the matching agent started to match me with other therapists. 

She matched me with therapists that had no available appointments, dealt with mainly pediatric patients, or their language was Spanish which I don't speak. It was added stress when I was looking to speak to someone about the stress I already had. I grew frustrated. 

The next provider I thought I successfully matched with was super attentive, but was really reluctant to video chat with me even though it was a service I paid for. Every time I scheduled a video chat, she asked me if it was ""really necessary"" or if I would prefer a phone call instead. When I finally got her to video chat with me, I was left with a frozen screen on her side showing a wall and the tippy top of her forehead for the entire 45 minutes. The things she talked during the video chat where strange and not ""therapist-y"" at all. She started to talk about HER prolems. She was almost childish in the way she spoke. I didn't feel like she was taking me seriously and there was something... off... about her speech. I ended the video chat feeling anxious, blamed and ridiculous. Like I offered her more advice than she offered me. I threw her name into a simple google search and found out she has severe mental disabilities. Im not even entirely sure she's qualified for a therapist position because I could find very little on her education experiences. I only found articles from when her and her family were interviewed about her disabilities. 

I decided I didn't want to waste any more time searching for a therapist with this service who has provided me with nothing but more stress and aggravation. So I canceled my subscription and asked for a refund. They canceled my membership and immediately told me they were sending me a refund for $1882. It was $14 less than I paid but I figured that was fine since that's about what I would pay for the janky services I received.

A week went by and I checked my account to make sure the refund went through. Thats when I found out that it did, but they also charged me again. $276 came out of my account and I emailed to ask why. Their website provides NO PHONE NUMBER to contact an actual human. A few days went by with no response so I emailed AGAIN.... no response. 

Just this weekend I get an email saying ""Thank you for your purchase."" They charged me an ADDITIONAL $396 and told me my next payment will be taken on March 14th. 

So during this past month when I have had NO SUBSCRIPTION with their service, they have charged me $672 total. 

I have emailed multiple times with no response. I signed on to my Talkspace page and it clearly states I have no subscription and that I canceled on January 19th. I tried to remove my CC information they have stored and it wouldn't let me. I tried to enter false cc information thinking it wouldn't go through the next time they tried to charge me and they would then, of course, try and contact me.... but it wouldn't let me do that either. 

I put my FBI cap on. Since there's no phone number anywhere on their website, I googled their physical address. Then I googled the phone number for that address. I called it and it was an automated Talkspace voicemail machine. I left a message and still no response. 

Thats when I decided to make this post. I tried to be an adult about this, but lately companies only seem to respond when they're publicly bashed on the internet. 

Im not normally a Karen, but Im prepared to go full Karen over the $672 Talkspace owes me. Thats a lot of money that we've been robbed of. I also want my cc information deleted from their program so this can not happen again. 

I would love a response to my emails or voicemails asap. 

Worst case scenario... their physical address is right here in NYC. I can always just show up.",False,Samberg91184,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 21146516, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this detailed review based on your experience.

2021-02-11 14:52:23,"Took $260 of my money, never gave me a therapist.",1,"I signed up for Talkspace and tried to get a therapist. First of all, they make you talk to something called a “Matching Agent” who isn’t the therapist. They talk to you about “What brings you to Talkspace?” This is completely wrong because it’s not the therapist. I was kind of tricked into opening up to this person. 

Rates are really bad. 
$65/week for JUST TEXTING. 
$260/month for JUST TEXTING. Oh, and a free 10 minute video session. I didn’t even look beyond this price point. 

Went with the $260. 

Then I picked “my” therapist. I typed to her and typed and typed. She never responded. Talkspace’s response to the FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION of “Why isn’t my therapist answering?”  was a pithy article about how “therapists are humans too” and they’ve got a lot of work to do, or something. I wish I could tell my boss that! 

Instead of an actual solution,  Talkspace offers TWO options: 1) wait for a reply or 2) choose a different therapist. 
(Then what the was all that “matching” for?)
I decided that I had spent WAY too much money to be ignored and wanted my money back. I submitted a request ticket stating that I hadn’t even gotten to use the services and I wanted my money back. They completely ignored my first service request. I ended up submitting 3 more service requests. Still ignored.  

Then, I went on Twitter. The ONLY WAY to get their attention was to get on Twitter and publicly decry them for stealing. I got a DM from whomever was running the Twitter and THEN AND ONLY THEN was I able to get my money back. I still haven’t actually gotten it back, it’s going to take 2-5 business days. 

Suffice it to say, they’re taking advantage of depressed people during a pandemic. The matching specialist never even offered up the fact that they accept insurance until AFTER  you’ve already paid the money. Then, if you want to add your insurance card, that technically starts another “account”, and both accounts will remain open AND auto renew unless you fix it and close the first one. It’s money. Money money money. Don’t use it. Spend the time searching for a REAL therapist that is covered by your insurance.",False,Cromalon008,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 21146282, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for providing this detailed review based on your experience.

2021-01-03 13:08:08,"Generic therapy, slow response, causes anxiety",1,"I was thoroughly disappointed - I thought this would be perfect for me with a busy and irregular schedule. The one live session I scheduled was canceled by talk space because the therapist never confirmed it.

The few responses I did get from the therapist were so boiler plate generic that I'm positive everyone gets exactly the same response. I felt like the after thought obligation of someone trying to ""get their work done"" while running out the door to a party. I sent very thorough messages, waited a long time for a response, then the response was generic, so I elaborated even more and waited again for another generic response. Really no ""therapy"" happening. You could achieve the same therapeutic benefit by just writing in a journal - the responses you get will be just as useful. 

I set up therapy through a local clinic that offers in person or telemedicine. They take my insurance unlike Talkspace, scheduling is easy, and they do therapy live over face time. For the same $260 per month, I could literally have 26 hours of LIVE sessions with a highly trained therapist over face time, due to insurance copay. You'd be surprised how many places are offering similar telemedicine these days. Talk space live session is very short, and I can't speak to how effective it is since my session got canceled. The talk space model is not necessary any more, since most clinics are offering telemedicine due to covid. 

Talkspace only issued a partial refund after I had the service for less than 3 days, literally 4 very generic responses from the therapist, 1 canceled live session, and not responding to my support ticket for multiple days. I sent support an email and got an automatic response which thankfully had instructions for canceling and requesting a refund. Unfortunately the refund is calculated pro rata automatically and I'm waiting for a response from a human being. As of this moment, I'm still out $35. I'm so tired of these companies that make it really easy to spend money, and really difficult to get it back if you're not satisfied.

Hopefully you will find a better experience. For me, it only served to increase the anxiety that I was hoping to relieve.",False,CabrasAventuras,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
2021-03-11 15:22:58,So non-responsive I can’t even sign up.,1,"My regular therapist is on maternity leave for 3 months so I wanted to give this app a try to hold me over until she is back. I was also really interested in seeing if the model might actually work better for me in the long term, and was willing to try the plan with weekly video chats as well as 24/7 messaging. Unfortunately I have not even been able to get signed up. 

When I created an account, I figured I’d be taken to a page where they would want to gather info about me and then offer me a plan to sign up for, then match me with a therapist. Nope. It just took me to a generic landing page with zero instruction. It took me a bit to figure out there was a message from someone who said she would guide me through the intake process. Ok, great! She asked to start with my name and age which I gave her, then she says “hi how can I help”. I let her know I just wanted to get started with the app and she gave me pricing and then asked what prompted me to seek therapy. I responded, then heard nothing back. Later that night I checked in to see if there was anything else we needed to do for this “intake process” she mentioned. No response. This morning, another check in - anything else to get started? No response. 

I do see in the app there is a place to sign up for a membership but why would I want to do that if I can’t even get a response on the intake process?

2020-05-18 15:17:57,"Good in theory, Not in practice",1,"I am thankful to my therapist for being responsive, and checking in at least once a day. He was also respectful and professional. I did get 1-2 nuggets of useful advice. However, I found the therapy lacking in many ways and ultimately unhelpful. I was hoping for insight into my situations, but most responses I got were very basic—either easily googled or common sense. Still I was hopeful and wanted to give it a chance. I reiterated my goals with my therapist so he knew I wasn’t just here to vent, that I was looking for deeper understanding of what was going on. I continued to find the responses more of repetitions of what I said rather than anything I could learn from. I even tried nudging him in the right direction by suggesting possible explanations I learned from my own reading, hoping he would delve deeper. In response my therapist would agree with me and give a one sentence “elaboration.” I felt he was just trying to keep me happy and “feeling heard,” but I couldn’t get much depth or new information from him. He honestly seemed to be trying his best but either through lack of skill/knowledge or the format’s limitations, this therapy did not deliver. After a few weeks I found that answering the messages felt like a chore. I responded to the therapist just to get it off my to do list. I wasn’t getting anything useful from it.

 

Btw, I was a little put off that I had to include an emergency contact’s full name and phone number. I had hoped for some anonymity due to the personal nature of things I would talk about. I tried to give just a first name, but he would not continue without a first AND last name, and phone number. 

Overall, from my experience I don’t think this format of therapy is going to help people looking for real therapy. The delay in response time (which to be fair, they warn you about) and that it’s written, makes it hard to connect or get deeper. Not sure who this would work for? It really makes me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews.... If you want to pay $300+ a month for someone to read your texts and agree with you then sure. But I regret opening up about highly personal things and spending the money I did. I feel I can get better information googling mental health advice than from this.",False,Ahrrrrjeeee,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
2020-09-30 17:04:01,Put your money toward other therapy,1,"I struggle with an anxiety disorder and depression. I needed to start speaking with someone quickly and thought this would be a good way to do so while finding a local therapist for tele-visits. 

For the cost of the service I could have had three actual therapy sessions. I heard from the therapist after the time the app told me I would and they explained that they have no control over how many patients they have so they cannot even begin to meet the deadlines set in the app. We’re talking about 100 people being assigned to a single therapist. No one can be expected to provide quality therapy to that many clients. 

Did some more online research and found out that therapists are barely getting paid so why would there be any incentive for them to answer messages let alone provide meaningful responses? So yes, I could switch therapists, but then a person who has done nothing wrong but can’t keep up with Talkspace’s ridiculous client numbers gets penalized and I would just get shifted to another therapist in the same boat. It’s not right for either of us. 

I wish I’d researched them more before signing up but I was in need of help and short on time. Now they have my money, don’t offer refunds and I’m at square one and facing the same issues I signed up to get help managing on my own.  $300+ dollars has given me some generic exercises easily found in any CBT/DBT workbook and an expensive digital journal and no actual therapy. 

I feel cheated out of my therapy budget for the month and will not continue with the service. If you are struggling with any diagnosed condition this is not a good place to seek assistance. While they claim that it’s less expensive than traditional therapy, it’s not and the value for the money is low for both patients and therapists. Talkspace strikes me as a very predatory business taking advantage of already vulnerable people attempting to find legitimate help for actual health concerns.

2020-06-08 16:45:32,"Great concept, bad follow through",1,"I wanted to like this app so much.. but no.. 

I’m a very straightforward person. I told my backstory, how that effects me, and how I’d like to improve, and what type of things I expected from therapy/needed.

The first therapist was an okay person, but bad therapist.. He literally compared every “problem” of mine to a bigger problem he had once in his life. He provided no coping mechanisms. And talked like a fortune cookie. No help whatsoever. He made life sound like a sad existence that you just have to get used to... No Thanks!!

Second therapist was a young woman who just sounded really cocky after we actually talked. Like she knew everything and how to fix everything. But didn’t actually try to “fix” anything. And basically belittled me and told me what I thought was wrong and sent a passive aggressive message “proving” me wrong. 

Third one seemed like she would have been actually helpful. Helped me learn a breathing technique right away. But we didn’t really talk as much as I hoped we could. And by this point, I wasn’t really willing to waste more time and money on this app. 

As I was trying to cancel my subscription they kept offering me cheaper and cheaper deals and plans. Not sure if it was because they actually want to provide help to less fortunate people, or because they want any and all money they can get...

Either way, it would be nice if they could screen their employees before letting them actually see patients. People deserve great mental health care and I’ve seen a couple subpar therapists right off the bat. Real therapy can and should help you. And it shouldn’t be this hard to find a good therapist.

2021-01-04 19:53:05,"For a therapy app, it did a great job of making me feel completely insignificant.",1,"I signed up for Talkspace at the beginning of November of 2020 after realizing I needed to seek counseling for my general anxiety and severe insecurity and social anxiety. Like most people who struggle with these things, particularly social anxiety, it took a great deal of courage to take the step to get help, especially because I had never been through therapy before due to cost and extreme hesitancy to reach out for professional help. This is something I mentioned repeatedly to my therapist and the matching representative throughout my brief time with Talkspace. 

I was assigned to a therapist named Lisa within a day or two of signing up with Talkspace. I was very open with my deep sense of imposter syndrome and social anxiety and though I wasn’t in immediate peril, it was really important for me to talk to someone so I could regain control of my life. It was going fine until I received a notification that my therapist would be on vacation until the end of December. At this point, it was around November 8, and I’d used Talkspace for less than a week. Neither Lisa nor Talkspace gave me any prior notification that she would be gone or gave me a substitute—or, assigned me to a therapist who didn’t have a month and a half vacation planned. Instead, the automated notification in my chat with Lisa said I was encouraged to keep sending messages to her so I could write down my feelings and she’d get back to me when she returned from vacation. Yes, Talkspace expected me to continue paying the fee for a MONTH AND A HALF while I message myself in an echo chamber. Especially as a person who struggles with self image and feeling valued by others—which, again, I made very clear to everyone at Talkspace I talked with—this was a massive blow and completely undid what little therapy Lisa had provided me. 

I emailed Talkspace explaining the situation in detail, how horrible it made me feel, how irresponsible both Talkspace and Lisa were, and asking for a refund. I received a very sterile automated response telling me to fill out a form so I could get my refund, and everything I had written about my displeasure with my experience fell completely on deaf ears. I felt so insignificant, which was intensified by the fact that it was a therapy service that supposedly made counseling affordable, accessible, and empowering. It did none of those things for me.

I have Cigna and have already talked with them and they had told me that I was covered for TalkSpace. When I brought up the issue with the customer support, they took more than 5 days to reply to my issue at hand and suggested the same solution that I had already tried and didn’t work. I have put in at least 3 tickets dealing with the same issue and the customer support person was the same and told me the same thing. This has been going on for about a month now and I am fed up with it. There is no other form of communication other than emailing them and that doesn’t work. They need a customer support line as this is absolutely ridiculous that I am not able to get a manager or anyone other than the same tech person to help me resolve this problem. Not to mention that I am not able to set up a video session with my provider as the system does not appear to connect me with my provider. If I could I would’ve given it less stars as the system and app do not match with the service being provided. These are people that are dealing with mental health issues and shouldn’t have to be stressed out over not being able to talk with their therapist as they are paying for a service provided.

The daily texting is pretty useless. You get one response back a day from therapist and all the responses I got back we’re pretty useless. Usually just “how did that make you feel” sorta responses, didn’t add much value.

My therapist also cancelled our scheduled appointment twice so I never even really got to book a session with him for our first month.

He was in the hospital apparently but talkspace wouldn’t refund me any of the month except prorated of what was left despite never even really getting any value out of the service.

Overall I wouldn’t say it’s very useful or affordable. The daily messaging is somewhat useless and 400 dollars for 2 hours of phone time isn’t exactly cheap etc.

I requested for them to cancel my account on February 5th and asked if I could get a refund for the first months service (260 dollars) which I signed up for on February 1st. The one therapy provider who got in touch with me was a no show and sent me a total of two messages trying to schedule a time we could talk (she never showed up for the time we arranged). I requested another therapy provider who also never got in touch. So ultimately in February I was charged 260 dollars for NO THERAPEUTIC help whatsoever. 

Customer service cancelled my TICKET for customer service, where I asked that they cancel my account and if possible provide a refund. It’s now March 1st and I see another charge for 260 dollars. 

So they have altogether stolen 520 dollars for me. Not to mention, throughout my subscription I got ZERO THERAPEUTIC HELP. I was unable to talk to a SINGLE PERSON/THERAPIST. 

Do yourself a favor and find a real therapist through headway.co, which is ultimately what I ended up having to do. They can pair you with a provider who actually takes your insurance so that the charge is just for the copay.
