"I sent my first message to a therapist in early September. Waited 3 weeks. got no reply. Switched my therapist. Sent the same message to my new therapist end of September. Got no reply. I messaged talkspace to tell them I was disappointed. Deleted the app. In December  (over 4 months later!!) I got an email saying my therapist sent me a message. So I reinstalled the app. It was a generic message asking how I was doing but I was just glad to get a response. So I responded to the message. No reply for a few days. Then another message: ‘hi how are you doing?’ No response to the quite specific information I had given in my initial message or my response to the first one.. so I asked if this was a real person. ‘Yes my name is...*****’ then a few days later, ‘I hope you’re doing well’ so once again I responded with a specific response about how I was actually doing. Nothing. Days go by. So I tell the therapist ( and sent a message to talkspace support again)that I don’t see how this is supposed to be helping me or in any way construed as therapy and that maybe they don’t have time to take me on as a client.. Therapist then responds (very quickly this time) that they are so sorry but they are recovering from COVID. Wow. Why would you have people providing a service that for whatever reason they cannot provide? So am I supposed to feel bad because I expected actual therapy or Counseling from a counseling service???

"I originally wanted to try talkspace because I have a tendency of running away after a few sessions. I thought the low commitment of talkspace might be helpful to me. Seems like low commitment is all you get from your therapists. I went through two different therapists that just wrote fortune cookie grade short responses that I’m sure they only wrote those so they wouldn’t get in trouble with talkspace as they’re required to respond to you in a certain time frame. I feel like that system is made with good intentions, but it seems seriously abused by the therapists. I absolutely would not recommend the therapists on this app. Your money is better spent on a REAL therapist. I’m sure the ones on here are better in person, but the system just makes it ripe for abuse.

The app itself is great to use and the user experience and onboarding process is great and welcoming, but that’s where the feeling of progress stops. The person who pairs you with a therapist doesn’t really care who you’re paired with. Therapists can put whatever they want on their profile and they won’t actually use their skills to help you. I literally received this advice by my therapist, “You have to develop some ways of calming yourself down.” I specially sought out a therapist that specialized in CBT. And asked what sort of techniques they might know. And I’m told to discover it myself. That’s what your $180 is paying for.",False,2021-04-14 02:45:48,dahbearz,1,Therapists more or less phone it in,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 22268777, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this detailed review based on your experience.

"Review for MESSAGING ONLY OPTION: 
   I typically don’t review apps, but this ones a little different. When I heard of this app and how convient it is supposed to be for you I thought I’d give it a try. It’s advertised as easy texting between you and a therapist, but it takes so long for them to reply :/ ( Ik they have other clients, but it shouldn’t say working now but response tmw)  that’s definitely not what I was expecting when I downloaded the app. I saw a few other reviews saying the same, that therapist only reply once or sometimes twice ( which it does say in the informed consent you agree to when you are matched with a therapist).
   While that consent does say if you want to schedule with your therapist a time for “real-time” instant responses, you can do so; when I asked my current one if we can do that she basically turned it down to say that she thinks it’s better for me to have a relaxed space to type, even though I rather the instant messaging back 😕. 
    I had high hopes for this app but I don’t think I’ll be renewing my subscription, unless it dramatically changes over next few weeks, especially with its cost & late response, for example: You text at 3pm, and you’ll get a message similar to... “expect a response by tomorrow at 3pm” type of thing.",False,2021-02-25 03:05:58,AZ 🏜,3,Mixed feelings 🙃,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 21351620, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review.

"I loved the idea of Talkspace but I was a bit apprehensive as I was reading the reviews. Many people said they never heard back from their therapist and had to find a new one multiple times.  I eventually decided to download it but unfortunately, my experience was exactly the same. I haven’t heard from my therapist and it’s been well over a week since when I’ve initially contacted her the first time. I’ve done in person therapy and I thought I’d be a great candidate for TalkSpace. It’s ridiculous that you pay upfront for these services when a response back from a therapist isn’t even guaranteed. With the money I already paid for the month, I could have had 2 in-person one hour sessions (and I would pay AFTER these services were provided). I’m holding this platform to a higher standard because you all are offering therapy services to people who are requesting help. It’s really unfortunate that more often than not, people aren’t hearing back from their therapists. I’m not even going to try to find another therapist because I don’t want to waste another week of my time retaking the questionnaire/matching with a new therapist/ waiting for their response. It’s unfair to expect users to wait 2-3 weeks of their first month just waiting for a first response from anyone. Hopefully this platform will get better and I’d be open to trying it at that time.",False,2021-06-02 02:01:38,KrisC12344,1,"Great idea, very poor execution",talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 23183951, 'body': 'Hi there, thanks for providing this review.

"I never ever write reviews and I certainly don’t like to trash people but I want to do this so that other people don’t waste their time and money on this. They coax you in with a very kind matching agent named Laura. She’s quick and caring and gets you to drop the money quick. Of course, if you’re struggling with mental health issues and needing help on a budget you’ll do what it takes. Then they match you with a therapist and tell you they’ll respond within 24 hours. The guy I chose never responded. So I went to search for a new therapist and was brought to a new matching agent named Holli Fiscus-Connon who took 20 minutes to respond and was so cold and uncaring. Short answers. No apology for my disappointment. Simply said “I found you a new match”. I clicked and what do you know...ITS THE SAME GUY THAT NEVER RESPONDED! I told her that it’s the same guy and that I felt disappointed and requested a refund. Without any remorse she just told me to message customer support. Cold, nonchalant, indifferent. Turns out she’s a therapist too! Who are these disconnected therapists that treat peoples problems so casually? It’s totally unacceptable. So disappointing that this is a business that is being run at the expense of people with mental health struggles. Seeing the reviews here, clearly this is something that happens a lot. App deleted.

"Before you offer an application that’s primary purpose is supporting mental health needs, PLEASE be responsible and ensure it works properly. My therapist on here is AMAZING. Love her! However using TS as a platform has been horrible. The app crashes, we constantly have audio issues even tho both of us do not experience the same issues on other platforms like Zoom and MS Teams. What broke the straw was needing to refill an Rx for an antidepressant. My therapist is saying TalkSpace won’t allow her to call in a refill without a checkin appt. the app is saying I need to pay $125/for a 30 min check in to get even though my insurance has verified more than once that it 100% covered. So here I am about to run out of my meds and there is no way to call anyone at TalkSpace, my therapist can’t call in my Rx, and so I’m stuck choosing to find a new doctor?! Or pay $125 out of pocket?! Wth. My insurance also told me they’d received several calls about this exact issue with TalkSpace. 
This is a SERIOUS issue folks. Messing with people’s ability to get access to their meds is not something you can chalk up to a “glitch” in your app.

"For an app that’s supposed to help with mental health, Talkspace has caused me even more stress. Both therapists and customer service have caused issues. I’ve been using it since November and am already on my 4th therapist, which isn’t going well either. 1st therapist, great couple of months, notified me a month out that they were leaving the service. Cancelled every session last minute for her last month. 2nd therapist, showed Monday afternoon availability on their schedule but was never available. Customer service matching agent was not helpful at all, I did not have a session for another month. 2 months of no sessions due to therapist unavailability is unacceptable! 3rd therapist deprioritized me in favor of her “day job” clients. 4th therapist refuses to have their calendar on the app and has missed or cancelled weekly sessions last minute. Multiple therapists have missed the timing deadline for responding to messages, but there is no way to submit complaints regarding therapists. Therapists are not held accountable for their poor treatment of patient! Again, customer service matching agent has not been helpful at all and did not respond when I asked about a psychiatrist, after my therapist submitted a request for one.

"After signing up, it was all downhill: 1) they took my money and then a therapist didn’t schedule my first apt for 1 week, 2) when I reached out to customer service, they denied my request not to charge me for the time I was not getting service while waiting for my previously mentioned first appointment, 3) when I did try to reach out to customer service to ask them to wave the charges while I waited for my first appointment, they would barely read my emails and it would take them 2 days to respond. I cancelled my service and request a full refund. I would NEVER recommend this service. If you’re considering it, read the most recent reviews.

UPDATE: App developers reached out to apologize and gave me an email address to reply to so they could “make things right”. During all of my interactions with Talkspace, they had multiple opportunities to “make things right” and they just made my experience a drag. A customer should not have to send 3 emails to get her money back when an agreed-upon service is not being delivered. Shame on Talkspace for a half-hearted attempt at PR damage control.

"My first therapist was good and I started working with him right before covid and losing my job, so he was very helpful. But he constantly had video issues or I couldn’t schedule an appointment with him through the app. I stuck with him and was willing to tolerate the technical issues and assumed because he’s not as familiar with the technology. He constantly missed/ignored the response time requested and to me who has mild anxiety issue it is very uncomfortable. He then missed sessions for the third time and that was when I decided to switch therapist. I had all my chat history transferred to the new therapist and then she complained it was too much to read. She was also insensitive to my culture AND she missed sessions. 
I’ve been writing to customer support for all these issues and it takes weeks for them to get back. What do patients do when we can’t reach our therapists and customer support can’t help?

"At some point there was the ability to search the Talkspace provider directory without signing up. For mental health I have particular preferences I am looking for in a provider. It is really difficult to find providers that serve communities of color.  

This time around I could not search myself and had to pay upfront. My experience with the intake provider was poor. He called me by the wrong name. The intake form lacked the ability to specify more specific preferences.  After a day I was matched and unfortunately the 1 match was not a fit due to a preference I for got to mention. Another day goes by and the intake provider tells me that is the only match to my preferences when I told him the day before she was not a match. I wasted 2 days going back and forth for something I could have done on my own in 10-15 minutes. Now they will not give me a full refund. I feel ripped off.

"1) I failed to find an orientation video to help navigate the features of the app. I had to experiment and ask questions to the therapist about technical aspects. 

2) A prerecorded video introduction from a potential therapist would be ideal for selecting the right one. There were short bios about a paragraph long. In hindsight, it turned out not being enough information.

3) Advice for first timers; do research on the therapy methods offered before selecting a therapist. I went in blind and CBT wasn’t for me. They offered a different method, but it turns out in my case I just needed someone to listen to me. I worked out a lot myself, on my own.

"I downloaded this app under the delusion that it would somehow replace my in-person therapy now that the pandemic has made it impossible to go into an office. After a few weeks of using it, I am pretty disappointed in the therapist-patient relationship experience.

I don’t know if Talkspace has enacted some kind of character limit for their therapists’ responses, but I could bare my entire soul in a huge message and my therapist will give me a one sentence response. Usually it’s just to regurgitate something basic stuff you already know. This is not helpful at all. 

If you are looking for real therapy, this app is not it. Unless you go for the expensive video sessions, I just don’t see this app helping at all. It’s more like a digital journal that occasionally talks back to you or like talking to a magic 8 ball.

"I love the idea of this app but the cost outweighs the benefits, and I say this as someone who loved the therapist I matched with. Paying $260 MINIMUM per month is ridiculous when what you get is someone who essentially replies to your texts once a day, multiple times a day if you're lucky, but usually only a handful of times per week. To my knowledge, there is no way to give ongoing feedback about the quality of your therapy to Talkspace--how often therapists miss their scheduled response should be displayed prominently somewhere!

Talkspace gives away free sessions and discounts like candy, which I appreciated at first, but at some point it becomes obvious that if they can give away so much free stuff then they are just wildly overcharging everyone to begin with. 

Also, half the features don't work! On multiple occasions I was offered a free week or 50% off automatically in the app, but nothing happened after I accepted the prompt. My guess is that's a coding/UI error, but it was incredibly frustrating to be constantly offered discounts that never materialized.

Bottom line is that this app is great if money is no object for you, and if you can tolerate therapy in bits and pieces over a long texting conversation (which I could not but that's my personal preference) rather than 30-60 minute substantive conversations. The app does offer face to face conversations but that means paying $400 (!!!!!) per month or $65 per session on top of $260 for texting, unless they accept your insurance, which seems exceedingly rare.

"I had nothing but great things to say about talkspace and my therapist of nearly 2 years, up until recently... now, I would recommend that everyone stay AWAY from this service and this company, who doesn’t seem truly invested in mental well-being at all. 

Without warning, without indication she was taking time away, my therapist stopped responding to messages, there was no formal termination of care, and I haven’t been able to get ahold of her for 3 months now. I can see that she has “read” texts I’ve sent, but they go unanswered. She literally just ghosted on me. I am mentally vulnerable and was dealing with a lot during the Covid pandemic, self isolating for over 400 days due to being high risk. Talkspace doesn’t provide you with any sort of recourse for a situation like this. To make matters worse, there are apparently “no records” covering my care from my therapist, so if I wanted to change providers (inside OR outside of talkspace), I’m going to have to start from literally ground zero. Over 2 years of therapy on talkspace is over $5,000 worth of time that I have spent working on many topics with my therapist, and talkspace is not doing much to help me get my records (which are legally my property). This company treats mental health patients as if they are using a service like Uber. They don’t hold themselves accountable when things go wrong. I’m constantly told how my “concerns are being escalated” but nothing changes. Now, after being abandoned by a provider I trusted and worked with for 2 YEARS, I am afraid to trust another provider. It will take me months, if not years to recover from the trauma of being abandoned by my therapist when I really needed her. Talkspace offers me no solutions of how I can get my records or what I can do. There’s no consequence for the abandonment and I had to fight to get money back for the weeks I went without therapy. 
I’m disappointed— the concept could’ve been great, but clearly there is no protection for patients being really hurt when a therapist on talkspace fails to uphold their professional duty and obligations.

"I’ve never left a review for an app/service before, but I felt compelled to do so with TalkSpace because I fear that they are taking advantage of people’s mental health issues, especially amidst everything going on with COVID. 

I love the idea of Talkspace and think it could have been a perfect tool for me. Unfortunately, my first two providers took days to reply to my simple messages, and when they did finally reply, I was usually given an unhelpful and generic sentence or two. My first provider asked me what had and hadn’t worked in the past for me in therapy, and I said I didn’t care for worksheets. So she sent me…worksheets, ones that I could have easily found on the Internet on my own. And my second provider took so long to respond to messages that TalkSpace offered me additional free weeks of service. Seeing as the app has an immediate option to offer this kind of thing, I’m guessing they’re used to people complaining about providers taking so long. 

After my first provider abruptly left TalkSpace and my second provider stopped responding altogether, I found someone who I actually connected with. She said she was training to become a full-time employee of TalkSpace and I was excited to have more time with her. What I didn't know was that if I wanted to have that time with her beyond a quick message here and there, I had to pay $65 for a 30-minute video session on top of the monthly fee I already pay. Needless to say, I wasn’t going to do that. I'm not paying $200+ a month to get a one-sentence message every other day, and I'm certainly not going to pay more for a video session knowing that the quality of service will likely be lacking (if the rest of TalkSpace is any indication). 

I find it noble that TalkSpace wants to make therapy more accessible to more people, but I'm starting to wonder how much of that is just a facade to get people to cough up more money for a lackluster service. If you’re considering using TalkSpace, please know what you’re paying for. It is not traditional therapy, but rather a sporadic message here or there, with some generic worksheets tacked on. If you’re willing to pay for the video sessions, your experience may be better than mine.

"I signed up for Talkspace in the beginning of January thinking Telehealth might be my best option. I quickly realized its not for me. I paid for the 6 month service to save money. If I signed up for a bulk of months, I saved like 30%. The total cost for 24/7 chat thread, 4 video chats a month and unlimited voicemail services for 6 months was $1896. 

They set you up with a matching agent to find out what kind of provider you're looking for. Great. 

The first provider I matched with ignored me for days and wouldn't confirm any of the video chat appointments I scheduled (and paid for with my package) which ultimately led to them being canceled at the last minute. I decided she didn't work for what I needed so the matching agent started to match me with other therapists. 

She matched me with therapists that had no available appointments, dealt with mainly pediatric patients, or their language was Spanish which I don't speak. It was added stress when I was looking to speak to someone about the stress I already had. I grew frustrated. 

The next provider I thought I successfully matched with was super attentive, but was really reluctant to video chat with me even though it was a service I paid for. Every time I scheduled a video chat, she asked me if it was ""really necessary"" or if I would prefer a phone call instead. When I finally got her to video chat with me, I was left with a frozen screen on her side showing a wall and the tippy top of her forehead for the entire 45 minutes. The things she talked during the video chat where strange and not ""therapist-y"" at all. She started to talk about HER prolems. She was almost childish in the way she spoke. I didn't feel like she was taking me seriously and there was something... off... about her speech. I ended the video chat feeling anxious, blamed and ridiculous. Like I offered her more advice than she offered me. I threw her name into a simple google search and found out she has severe mental disabilities. Im not even entirely sure she's qualified for a therapist position because I could find very little on her education experiences. I only found articles from when her and her family were interviewed about her disabilities. 

I decided I didn't want to waste any more time searching for a therapist with this service who has provided me with nothing but more stress and aggravation. So I canceled my subscription and asked for a refund. They canceled my membership and immediately told me they were sending me a refund for $1882. It was $14 less than I paid but I figured that was fine since that's about what I would pay for the janky services I received.

A week went by and I checked my account to make sure the refund went through. Thats when I found out that it did, but they also charged me again. $276 came out of my account and I emailed to ask why. Their website provides NO PHONE NUMBER to contact an actual human. A few days went by with no response so I emailed AGAIN.... no response. 

Just this weekend I get an email saying ""Thank you for your purchase."" They charged me an ADDITIONAL $396 and told me my next payment will be taken on March 14th. 

So during this past month when I have had NO SUBSCRIPTION with their service, they have charged me $672 total. 

I have emailed multiple times with no response. I signed on to my Talkspace page and it clearly states I have no subscription and that I canceled on January 19th. I tried to remove my CC information they have stored and it wouldn't let me. I tried to enter false cc information thinking it wouldn't go through the next time they tried to charge me and they would then, of course, try and contact me.... but it wouldn't let me do that either. 

I put my FBI cap on. Since there's no phone number anywhere on their website, I googled their physical address. Then I googled the phone number for that address. I called it and it was an automated Talkspace voicemail machine. I left a message and still no response. 

Thats when I decided to make this post. I tried to be an adult about this, but lately companies only seem to respond when they're publicly bashed on the internet. 

Im not normally a Karen, but Im prepared to go full Karen over the $672 Talkspace owes me. Thats a lot of money that we've been robbed of. I also want my cc information deleted from their program so this can not happen again. 

I would love a response to my emails or voicemails asap.

"I signed up for Talkspace and tried to get a therapist. First of all, they make you talk to something called a “Matching Agent” who isn’t the therapist. They talk to you about “What brings you to Talkspace?” This is completely wrong because it’s not the therapist. I was kind of tricked into opening up to this person. 

Rates are really bad. 
$65/week for JUST TEXTING. 
$260/month for JUST TEXTING. Oh, and a free 10 minute video session. I didn’t even look beyond this price point. 

Went with the $260. 

Then I picked “my” therapist. I typed to her and typed and typed. She never responded. Talkspace’s response to the FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION of “Why isn’t my therapist answering?”  was a pithy article about how “therapists are humans too” and they’ve got a lot of work to do, or something. I wish I could tell my boss that! 

Instead of an actual solution,  Talkspace offers TWO options: 1) wait for a reply or 2) choose a different therapist. 
(Then what the was all that “matching” for?)
I decided that I had spent WAY too much money to be ignored and wanted my money back. I submitted a request ticket stating that I hadn’t even gotten to use the services and I wanted my money back. They completely ignored my first service request. I ended up submitting 3 more service requests. Still ignored.  

Then, I went on Twitter. The ONLY WAY to get their attention was to get on Twitter and publicly decry them for stealing. I got a DM from whomever was running the Twitter and THEN AND ONLY THEN was I able to get my money back. I still haven’t actually gotten it back, it’s going to take 2-5 business days. 

Suffice it to say, they’re taking advantage of depressed people during a pandemic. The matching specialist never even offered up the fact that they accept insurance until AFTER  you’ve already paid the money.

"I was thoroughly disappointed - I thought this would be perfect for me with a busy and irregular schedule. The one live session I scheduled was canceled by talk space because the therapist never confirmed it.

The few responses I did get from the therapist were so boiler plate generic that I'm positive everyone gets exactly the same response. I felt like the after thought obligation of someone trying to ""get their work done"" while running out the door to a party. I sent very thorough messages, waited a long time for a response, then the response was generic, so I elaborated even more and waited again for another generic response. Really no ""therapy"" happening. You could achieve the same therapeutic benefit by just writing in a journal - the responses you get will be just as useful. 

I set up therapy through a local clinic that offers in person or telemedicine. They take my insurance unlike Talkspace, scheduling is easy, and they do therapy live over face time. For the same $260 per month, I could literally have 26 hours of LIVE sessions with a highly trained therapist over face time, due to insurance copay. You'd be surprised how many places are offering similar telemedicine these days. Talk space live session is very short, and I can't speak to how effective it is since my session got canceled. The talk space model is not necessary any more, since most clinics are offering telemedicine due to covid. 

Talkspace only issued a partial refund after I had the service for less than 3 days, literally 4 very generic responses from the therapist, 1 canceled live session, and not responding to my support ticket for multiple days. I sent support an email and got an automatic response which thankfully had instructions for canceling and requesting a refund. Unfortunately the refund is calculated pro rata automatically and I'm waiting for a response from a human being. As of this moment, I'm still out $35. I'm so tired of these companies that make it really easy to spend money, and really difficult to get it back if you're not satisfied.

Hopefully you will find a better experience. For me, it only served to increase the anxiety that I was hoping to relieve.",False,2021-01-03 13:08:08,CabrasAventuras,1,"Generic therapy, slow response, causes anxiety",talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,
"My regular therapist is on maternity leave for 3 months so I wanted to give this app a try to hold me over until she is back. I was also really interested in seeing if the model might actually work better for me in the long term, and was willing to try the plan with weekly video chats as well as 24/7 messaging. Unfortunately I have not even been able to get signed up. 

When I created an account, I figured I’d be taken to a page where they would want to gather info about me and then offer me a plan to sign up for, then match me with a therapist. Nope. It just took me to a generic landing page with zero instruction. It took me a bit to figure out there was a message from someone who said she would guide me through the intake process. Ok, great! She asked to start with my name and age which I gave her, then she says “hi how can I help”. I let her know I just wanted to get started with the app and she gave me pricing and then asked what prompted me to seek therapy. I responded, then heard nothing back. Later that night I checked in to see if there was anything else we needed to do for this “intake process” she mentioned. No response. This morning, another check in - anything else to get started? No response. 

I do see in the app there is a place to sign up for a membership but why would I want to do that if I can’t even get a response on the intake process? 

I’m bummed I couldn’t even get signed up and am going to move on to exploring one of the other apps.",False,2021-03-11 15:22:58,TexasFight78703,1,So non-responsive I can’t even sign up.,talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,"{'id': 21715869, 'body': 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review.

"I signed up for Talkspace at the beginning of November of 2020 after realizing I needed to seek counseling for my general anxiety and severe insecurity and social anxiety. Like most people who struggle with these things, particularly social anxiety, it took a great deal of courage to take the step to get help, especially because I had never been through therapy before due to cost and extreme hesitancy to reach out for professional help. This is something I mentioned repeatedly to my therapist and the matching representative throughout my brief time with Talkspace. 

I was assigned to a therapist named Lisa within a day or two of signing up with Talkspace. I was very open with my deep sense of imposter syndrome and social anxiety and though I wasn’t in immediate peril, it was really important for me to talk to someone so I could regain control of my life. It was going fine until I received a notification that my therapist would be on vacation until the end of December. At this point, it was around November 8, and I’d used Talkspace for less than a week. Neither Lisa nor Talkspace gave me any prior notification that she would be gone or gave me a substitute—or, assigned me to a therapist who didn’t have a month and a half vacation planned. Instead, the automated notification in my chat with Lisa said I was encouraged to keep sending messages to her so I could write down my feelings and she’d get back to me when she returned from vacation. Yes, Talkspace expected me to continue paying the fee for a MONTH AND A HALF while I message myself in an echo chamber. Especially as a person who struggles with self image and feeling valued by others—which, again, I made very clear to everyone at Talkspace I talked with—this was a massive blow and completely undid what little therapy Lisa had provided me. 

I emailed Talkspace explaining the situation in detail, how horrible it made me feel, how irresponsible both Talkspace and Lisa were, and asking for a refund. I received a very sterile automated response telling me to fill out a form so I could get my refund, and everything I had written about my displeasure with my experience fell completely on deaf ears. I felt so insignificant, which was intensified by the fact that it was a therapy service that supposedly made counseling affordable, accessible, and empowering. It did none of those things for me. 

I had very high hopes for Talkspace and thought I was doing myself good by accepting that I needed help, but all I received in return was invalidation and a complete distrust of therapy.",False,2021-01-04 19:53:05,Youngtheris,1,"For a therapy app, it did a great job of making me feel completely insignificant.",talkspace-therapy-counseling,661829386,

"Signed up under a promo code, but usually it costs about 400 a month for one weekly half hour session and daily texting. It’s not that afford or great of a deal.

The daily texting is pretty useless. You get one response back a day from therapist and all the responses I got back we’re pretty useless. Usually just “how did that make you feel” sorta responses, didn’t add much value.

My therapist also cancelled our scheduled appointment twice so I never even really got to book a session with him for our first month.

He was in the hospital apparently but talkspace wouldn’t refund me any of the month except prorated of what was left despite never even really getting any value out of the service.

Overall I wouldn’t say it’s very useful or affordable. The daily messaging is somewhat useless and 400 dollars for 2 hours of phone time isn’t exactly cheap etc.

"I start off by saying that initially signing up for TalkSpace I encountered numerous issues, one of them was able to resolve the issue and connect me with a provider that I genuinely liked talking with but out of no where, my coverage of using TalkSpace was gone when I had initially put the information in. I have Cigna and have already talked with them and they had told me that I was covered for TalkSpace. When I brought up the issue with the customer support, they took more than 5 days to reply to my issue at hand and suggested the same solution that I had already tried and didn’t work. I have put in at least 3 tickets dealing with the same issue and the customer support person was the same and told me the same thing. This has been going on for about a month now and I am fed up with it. There is no other form of communication other than emailing them and that doesn’t work. They need a customer support line as this is absolutely ridiculous that I am not able to get a manager or anyone other than the same tech person to help me resolve this problem. Not to mention that I am not able to set up a video session with my provider as the system does not appear to connect me with my provider. If I could I would’ve given it less stars as the system and app do not match with the service being provided. These are people that are dealing with mental health issues and shouldn’t have to be stressed out over not being able to talk with their therapist as they are paying for a service provided. This is what the tech support sent me on multiple times even after I informed the person that the he’s solution did not work. Hi there, Thank you for your follow-up!

"THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM. I requested for them to cancel my account on February 5th and asked if I could get a refund for the first months service (260 dollars) which I signed up for on February 1st. The one therapy provider who got in touch with me was a no show and sent me a total of two messages trying to schedule a time we could talk (she never showed up for the time we arranged). I requested another therapy provider who also never got in touch. So ultimately in February I was charged 260 dollars for NO THERAPEUTIC help whatsoever. 

Customer service cancelled my TICKET for customer service, where I asked that they cancel my account and if possible provide a refund. It’s now March 1st and I see another charge for 260 dollars. 

So they have altogether stolen 520 dollars for me. Not to mention, throughout my subscription I got ZERO THERAPEUTIC HELP. I was unable to talk to a SINGLE PERSON/THERAPIST. 

Do yourself a favor and find a real therapist through headway.co, which is ultimately what I ended up having to do. They can pair you with a provider who actually takes your insurance so that the charge is just for the copay.

"I was excited to see that Talkspace “accepts insurance”.

To find out ANY details about cost (it’s $260/mo for basic text therapy, FYI) I had to go through a lengthy signup where they go so far as to “assign a therapist”. 

And then the insurance? It’s a scam. It’s basically a promo code for the first month.

"DOUBLE AND TRIPLE YOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE BEFORE GIVING THEM A DIME.  I paid $316 for my first month of therapy before my insurance became active.
