2021-02-01 19:41:43,Great for teens and young adults,5,False,ShelbyinSOWK615,"According to Moretti and Peled, depression is one of the most common issues of adolescence (2004). Adults experience a clarity of adolescent memories referred to as the reminiscence bump, likely the result of many firsts during this developmental stage (Steinberg, 2014); journaling and clarifying thoughts and emotions on these firsts can help in reflection and self-assurance. Additionally, Steinberg addresses the three R’s of adolescent brain development: reward, relationships, and regulation (2014). MindDoc would be helpful while the adolescent brain is in this stage of neuroplasticity; its design initiates reward-seeking behavior of completing tasks, and the acknowledgement of positive and negative emotions can help a teen learn to self-regulate. If a teen can recognize a pattern in their manic or depressive symptoms, they should be able to project that interpretation into their future and hopefully avoid or at least curb any risky behavior. While this app states that it is appropriate for ages twelve and above, it may be best for adolescents sixteen and older, during the time that their brains are better attuned to problem solving and abstract thought (Moretti & Peled, 2004).",minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,

Most of the time I was in a pretty good mood but then after looking at the analysis it said my mood was critical which I found odd when it was really only a couple times I felt bad. Not everyone is happy 24/7 so it telling you you’re critically depressed because you weren’t in the best mood a few times was somewhat disappointing. I’d look to find an app that’s more uplifting and gives more positive outlook as opposed to negative questioning constantly. 2 stars because the mood tracking 3 times a day was nice.",minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,"{'id': 22168570, 'body': 'Hello, thank you so much for your detailed feedback.

It helps me identify trends in my emotions, and properly informs my discussions with my therapist.

That being said, the biweekly “Results” are a cause for concern and I’m not sure what they are based off of. I reported a happy and positive mood for 24 out of 28 assessments that I responded to during my most recent time period. I’ve been in a significantly better mood recently, but when given my results from the app as to the current assessment of my mental state, I am being told I am in “Critical need of mental care”

It’s deeply concerning to me that the main algorithm that’s supposed to inform users of their overall mental health seems to be so inaccurate. I’d like to think that this is because of something wrong with a background calculation, but I can’t help feeling that a part of these diagnoses are to try and push me towards paid features.

I highly encourage the team reach out to me and help me understand what these mental health results are based off of, because at the moment these insights are drastically missing the mark and it’s damaging my trust with the app.",minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,"{'id': 20813693, 'body': ""Hello, thank you for reaching out!

The reflection portion of this App has helped me share my thoughts, feelings and basic emotions with others as i check-in daily here to keep track of how i’m really feeling.

2021-06-06 23:23:36,"Love it, could use some tweaks",5,False,Nichi Dani,"My only complaint is that standards of “emotional health” feel catered to neurotypical people. I wish it rated emotional health for the individual rather than how it stacks up against “normal” people. Someone with chronic mental illness ends up seeing “poor emotional health” while they’re feeling better. This can be discouraging. 

Maybe the app could ask people questions early on about what “normal” is for them. Someone with chronic depression, for instance, may have a lower “baseline” than someone without. It doesn’t feel fair to show them consistently that their very best is “moderate”. 

In every other way I love the app!",minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,

And the last thing I have say something about is the questions themselves.  I don’t know if it is only me, but whenever I finish answering the questions I feel worse than when the reminder went off.  It is like they are trying to take me to a darker place.

For chronic mental health issues, I think the questions should be better worded. For example, many of them ask “are you experiencing ___ more than normal” which is hard to evaluate when your baseline is abnormal. Others will ask “do you often____” and then ask how much that applies to you. I would prefer if it read “do you ____” and then choose how much it applies.",minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,

I also started to realize the effect the questions had on my state of mind.

Currently, the free version asks you a few questions 3x a day, allows you to record your emotional state and any thoughts, and gives you a report every two weeks. 

What appeals to me is the streamlined nature of the app. It has additional content for those interested, but for me, the free version fufills all that I need it to.

The only flaw is that I had data for about 6 months before they changed the name and structure of the app, resulting in the loss of all my journal enteries.

The ratings system and evaluations have completely unrealistic expectations for what good mental health looks like. I’ve been rated as having “Poor Mental Health” for several weeks because one day I feel unmotivated or because I haven’t been physically active recently. This thing screams at me every 2 weeks to “seek therapy now” and feels like a marketing tool to get people who may not actually need therapy to sign up for Better Help.

however, after creating the maximum number of custom emotions i could as a free user and then deciding they weren’t relevant, i deleted them thinking i could replace them. i learned that this isn’t possible, and instead the app redirects you to the option to upgrade.
