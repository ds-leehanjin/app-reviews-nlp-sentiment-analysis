"4.3
This app has a lot of useful information to help people understand the thoughts in their head. With great information on what depression is, the symptoms, and the treatment that all are based on factual information that I have learned in my college psychology classes. This app, developed by a group of experts in psychology can be used for many different things like keeping track of how you felt on a certain day as it gives you reminders to get into the app and let them know how you feel every morning, evening and night. You also will receive and assessment every 14 days of your emotional health that is based off your daily journal. This process repeats itself so you are able to track your progress. I am a big fan of the different “courses” that you can take and learn about that also give you exercises to help with what you learned in that course. There is a lot of upside to this app and it can feel like and easier route then actually seeing a psychologist especially with the scientific accuracy and detail this app can give. But, I wouldn’t substitute it for a real psychologist especially if you are experiencing severe symptoms. But overall this is a great app to help you log how you feel and learn information about depression that you would be able to learn in a psychology class.",4,2020-09-22 20:27:42,False,"C,Isaac",Solid app with very helpful information,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,
"I really value this app for requiring me to check in with myself and recognize how I’m feeling. It has been invaluable for that, because otherwise I just won’t and then wonder why I’m suddenly spiraling into depression. 
That said, I wish this app saved data to my phone. If I’m not on WiFi and have to use my subpar carrier’s data instead, I have a mini-panic when I open the app and don’t see the months of mood logging I’ve done, because it apparently isn’t stored on my phone, but (I’m guessing) on their servers or cloud or whatever. Along the same line, if I have to connect over my carrier’s data instead of WiFi, it will take FOREVER to load. I’ll get the notification that it’s time to answer questions, but then the questions will take a few minutes because they aren’t already on my phone. 
There are sometimes other issues where if I decide to answer questions a little bit before the time I’m supposed to, it doesn’t save my responses and instead, asks me again. These issues seem tied to just having that information stored in the app but on the phone, but I’m no engineer. All I know is I like this app but I wish there were other features or storage options that wouldn’t give me a panic or make me agitated when I’m in an otherwise good mood.",3,2020-03-12 21:00:09,False,Arielle_E_,Needs Some Features,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,
"I was really excited about this app at first, but after two months, it became just an annoyance. It asks about 3 questions from a small set of questions every day. It doesn't ask any questions to determine if the way you are feeling is due to stress. It doesn't address anxiety (even though it says it does in the description). The ""how are you feeling"" section at the end of the questions is arbitrary, doesn't get monitored or considered in your report at all. The insights it gives aren't helpful. When you are ""having a mild depressive episode"" it basically just tells you to just be happy.....I am giving it 3 stars because the way the app is set up has lots of potential to be so thing good. But for the amount of time you give it each day, you don't get much useful out of it. But is free and you get what you pay for.
I would be willing to pay a monthly subscription to this app if they expanded their data collections and analyzing, even if they didn't give a ""fix it"" insight, though I'd be willing to pay more if it had actually helpful tips to overcoming the problems it finds.....so it's not bad, but it's still in the baby phases of a becoming a great app. I deleted it for now. I may revisit it next year to see if things have improved.",3,2020-09-17 03:57:51,False,True Critic Reviews,It leaves a lot to be desired,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,
"Many of the questions need a “sometimes” or maybe an “other” button, they are hard to just answer “yes” or “no”. For example, “Have you been thinking about death recently?” There’s only a yes or no answer. I picked yes, because it was only a few days after the anniversary of my sister’s death, and also my deceased father’s birthday, plus one of my friend’s child had recently died. A chat box popped up immediately after I answered yes to the death question, asking if I thought about my death or self-harm, etc., but again, there are only yes or no answers. I understand that the answers have to be able to be entered into an algorithm that is computer-analyzed, but there still should be some way to expand on some of the answers, even if those “free texted answers” have to get analyzed by a real person instead of the computer. I do think that offering resources when someone answers key “trigger” answers is wonderful, to give help to those people without a mental health counselor. 
I have not yet finished my first two weeks of using the app, so my data has not yet been compiled into a report. I have an appointment with my counselor next week and I hope to be able to take my Moodpath data with me to the appointment.",3,2020-02-27 22:19:07,False,tmcossa,Good app but needs tweaking,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,
"According to Moretti and Peled, depression is one of the most common issues of adolescence (2004). Adults experience a clarity of adolescent memories referred to as the reminiscence bump, likely the result of many firsts during this developmental stage (Steinberg, 2014); journaling and clarifying thoughts and emotions on these firsts can help in reflection and self-assurance. Additionally, Steinberg addresses the three R’s of adolescent brain development: reward, relationships, and regulation (2014). MindDoc would be helpful while the adolescent brain is in this stage of neuroplasticity; its design initiates reward-seeking behavior of completing tasks, and the acknowledgement of positive and negative emotions can help a teen learn to self-regulate. If a teen can recognize a pattern in their manic or depressive symptoms, they should be able to project that interpretation into their future and hopefully avoid or at least curb any risky behavior. While this app states that it is appropriate for ages twelve and above, it may be best for adolescents sixteen and older, during the time that their brains are better attuned to problem solving and abstract thought (Moretti & Peled, 2004).",5,2021-02-01 19:41:43,False,ShelbyinSOWK615,Great for teens and young adults,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,
"I haven’t gotten my results back yet. But I just love how it is all set up! With the questions and the options/scale to tell how much things are bothering you. I downloaded several journaling apps and this one has been my favorite. Because of the way it asks you questions daily and things are modified based off your answers. I also love how it asks three questions a day, so I could figure out at what time I started feeling better or worse, what time my meds started and what time they faded, the question feature is super helpful. I also love how it doesnt only have “happy, sad, or mad” as emotions, but other more specific ones as well. It is difficult for me to just type and journal because I end up typing way to much about my feelings. So having adjectives to pick from was very nice, so I could just type about how I felt. The only complaint I have is that I cannot go back and edit my entires once I post them,  if I messed something up. I’ve only been using this app for a week and I’m already loving how easy it makes observing your own emotions.",4,2020-02-24 00:03:22,False,Glitter Girl ✨,Wonderful and very interactive,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,
"My first insight gave me a severe depressive episode. My second insight gave me a moderate depressive episode. The last two weeks were significantly worse for me than the previous two weeks, so I’ve been using vodka to numb my emotions. I tried to end my life because I feel so much worse, but apparently my depressive episode was better based on their questions. I think the moods should be taken into consideration better.  Just because I use alcohol to soften my depressive symptoms doesn’t mean I’m getting better. Either way, this app is a great way to track moods. I really like it for that, but I think more questions should be asked in a day. I answered no for crying more often, no for having slowed movements, but I did try to hang myself that night because I felt so depressed. It didn’t take that into consideration.

"I’ve been using this app for almost 6 months now. It’s been incredible - it visually shows me the progression of my moods via color-coded graphs and gives me access to patterns and other important data. It also has a journaling function that is AWESOME for mental health purposes and processing things. It sends me notifications 3 times a day - morning, mid-day, and late evening - and it prompts me to answer questions about how I’m feeling. It’s great.

However, I noticed a while ago that the functions that used to be free are now only accessible with a premium account. This premium account comes with a premium price tag - nearly $50 a year. I’m not happy to now have to pay for basic features like adding your own edited emotions to the list of ones to choose for each entry. I reached out to the develops/consumer services to express my discontent with this change.

"How is this app not more widespread???

It appears humanity is finally turning the page in beginning to understand and respect the importance of mental/emotional health. Unfortunately, this era seems too polarizing to be viable long-term. Where one self-aware individual takes root, three narcissists sprout up behind them. Or vice versa. I guess it depends on your personal blend of experiences.
Nonetheless, this app serves as a power-up to the former of folks and should at least be in the Top 10 charts. Especially given the circumstances... I mean, come on people. Let’s get our priorities straight and create a better batch of role models for the next round of kids. Some of us would like to get off this toxic merry-go-round!!! 

Alright, El Fin with the philosophical rant.
But really, this app is wonderful for many reasons. My favorite is that it helps those, who’ve previously dissociated due to trauma, reconnect with their somatic and emotional states. Many people don’t seek therapy because they don’t feel comfortable talking about their deep private feelings with another person. Duh, who does. Well, this app makes crossing that bridge a whole lot easier!

"Moodpath used to be the best mood tracker app but now all the really useful features (user inputted emotions, individual activities/skills used, ability to get data based on personalized inputs) is pay to play. And it’s $100 USD a year. That’s far too much for those most in need. There are dozens of good meditation apps and blogs, adding more of those features and taking away a core function of Moodpath was a junk capitalistic move.

It’s particularly sad to see this change since Moodpath is one of the few mood trackers that isn’t affiliated with any one school of therapy (DBT, CBT, etc). When it was customizable, you could just enter the skills (or the first few letters, it autopopulated based on history) and easily track whatever moods/skills/activities you and your therapist wanted.

"Positives: this is a fast, simple way to track your mood and see how your mental health can change over time. The questions take less than 30 seconds and the notifications help remind you. - The basic version is free
-provides basic coping info 
-gives diagnostic suggestions and clinical recommendations 
-they ask about suicide every-so-often and have a reasonable protocol for querying and offering resources (and I presume a method for dealing with people who are actively suicidal). 

Negatives: the biggest drawback to me is that the questions asked appear random/do not appear to change in response to your answers (if it they do it is too subtle to be meaningful). It would be feasible and helpful for them to create an algorithm that tailors questioning once you have responded for a certain length of time. For example, if you consistently endorse low mood and depressive symptoms, asking those questions more frequently over others. If you never endorse things like post-traumatic stress, OCD, or psychosis it is not necessary to have these as part of the regular data collection (maybe every few months or so it would be reasonable to re-check).

I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I find it hard to remember ever being low or ever being high. I tend to just tell my therapist that my week was “good” or “bad” based on how I was feeling in that moment because it was hard to see anything else due to the black and white thinking. 

Being able to track my emotions and symptoms help me really reflect on how I’m really feeling. I never realized that my mental health affects my physical state and when I used this app I saw that things like me sleeping too much is a sign of me experiencing depression.

It’s deeply concerning to me that the main algorithm that’s supposed to inform users of their overall mental health seems to be so inaccurate. I’d like to think that this is because of something wrong with a background calculation, but I can’t help feeling that a part of these diagnoses are to try and push me towards paid features.

Major flaw in the app with the exercises/lessons (which I love and find very helpful) except it doesn’t save any lists or anything you create once you finish it. If you want to go back it’s like you never went through the lesson except it shows a completed check. Example - doing the course on sleep and in one exercise you are to come up with a list of bedtime rituals (again great idea and I enjoyed walking through it) but then when I finished the lesson; everything I created was gone ;-(. So the issue is all these areas they want you to apply and use (again very helpful) you can’t because it disappears.

It makes me sad because this was the first mood app that I used regularly and it was really helping me track my manic and depressive episodes.

"As someone who suffers from severe depression and anxiety, this app has been life changing. It’s still a hell of a burden, but Moodpath makes it feel much more manageable. 

A lot of negative reviews note raise issue with the fact that questions are not more tailored to individual events like having a good dream or coming back from a bad meeting, but people’s circumstances are so different that it wouldn’t be effective to list every possible variable. The app doesn’t promise to track every good or bad thing that happens to you, only to help you monitor the response to those things (your mood).

For me, this insight has allowed me to stay objective when reality gets warped by my thoughts during an onset of an episode. And has made me better about looking at the events that trigger my mood (ei. Every time I have a bad morning happen to be around nights I have a bad dream). It gives insights that are tailored to your answers (“you’ve had difficult mornings lately”). 

I will echo the sentiment about adding some more moods at the end of the questions, but I feel like all of my reports have been accurate and my insights have been relevant so maybe that’s not an issue. 

I love that the reports can be generated into documents to share directly with your therapist. If you can’t invest in a therapist, the insights and modules are very well constructed and have helped me understand my feelings and what to do to make them better.

"I wish the app allowed you to select multiple adjectives at a time.  Why does it switch Back to the “emotions and situations” page after only one word selection? 

Since going through the entire list of words l—letters A through Z—is tedious, I’m too frustrated with all back-and-forth to even keep review anything after the letter C. Surely, you want to help people gather a representative account of their moods. Even if you have, say, a 10-word cutoff to endure some self-reflection to make the list as accurate as possible. 

Without easy way to select from a variety of words, i feel I’m missing a true sense of day-to-day distinction around my feelings as I’m tracking them. If I’m annoyed with the selection interface, then I’m going to keep achieving adjectives that seem “close enough” to how I’m actually feeling. Tired is always on the short automatic list the app provides, but when I’m not reviewing the app’s much longer word list, then I’m missing out on a word like exasperated or sleepy which are each their own distinct kind of tired. 

In general, I love the quick yes-no interaction with the app. And the automatic multiple choice list of adjectives does take the guesswork out of tracking your feelings. But again, for those of us who are curious and want to put extra thought and time into browsing and selecting from a broader range of descriptions, don’t make it harder and ultimately discouraging to do so. 

Also, let’s talk about MoodPath Guilt. It’s Easy to  feel guilty because you’re not doing the tracking three times a day.  there should be an option to start with tracking just once a day and still receiving a result. Maybe there are levels of engagement—but please don’t add a pay wall or premium— where you graduate from once a day Moodpath-ing after 30 days when you move to twice a day. The idea is you working your way up to three times a day after three months. 

But! Maybe there’s “go back to 1xday” or “go back to 2xday” option that the app presents if/when the user misses a check in. Then you can continue working your way toward the three times daily goal. This way, Moodpath becomes a habit-building instrument that fosters self-esteem which is a bonus positive effect  beyond just collecting mood data.",4,2020-05-30 14:19:12,False,#Penny4YourAppThoughts,A feelings app that I’m actually (actively) using—but there’s significant room for Improvement,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,

I received a notification stating I needed to answer all the questions for an accurate assessment (3xday morning, afternoon and evening). That is good, however, if I did not have access to my phone in the afternoon, I cannot find a way to go back and access those questions. In other words, questions not answered can effect the assessment but THERE IS A window of opportunity and if missed, oh well.

After answering the questions, a screen pops up with accompanying emotions. It wasn’t until the fourth day, I accidentally discovered those listed are samples, but by hitting the + button, there is a wide variety of emotions to choose from.

Lastly, printed in light grey at the very bottom there is a small space below your selected  emotions asking for reasons for those feelings.

Once the entry is complete, the only change which can be made is adding bad, very bad, moderate, and happy...

There is no way of asking for more questions, there is no place to write out a daily journal, and there is no way to access the greater list of emotions in order to modify or add.

I was able to find FAQ about the app, but no support. I can’t say how reliable or helpful my assessment will be as I have been navigating the app blindly.

The articles and courses are rather basic, perhaps for those new to depression.

I see the app has potential if it clarifies the steps, allows for changes or additions to an entry, and include some articles for treatment resistant depression.",3,2020-09-24 13:26:23,False,Angstoner,Good app but missing support,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,"{'id': 18804702, 'body': 'Hello, thank you for your feedback.

"Geared towards individuals with no self-awareness of mood or understanding of the rudimentary principals of psychological wellness. Honestly, this is High School Intro to Psych 101 stuff. Questions are generic, repetitive and provide little insight. Mood is much more complex than simply clicking a Happy, Sad or Neutral face emoji and clicking on a few emotion tags like “lonely” “sad” or “worried” Seems targeted to teens. But perhaps this is why this feature is free...

The “courses” are expensive, and (for me) add little value. “Learning modules” are insulting to anyone with half a brain, because its the most rudimentary, surface-level info that can easily be Googled (i.e what is depression, what are emotions, how to be mindful, importance of sleep, and breathing exercises). Common knowledge. Seriously?? 

But I’ve been diagnosed with depression for over a decade, have studied CBT, DBT and been through years of therapy & meds. So this app is not useful for individuals like me. Its good for maintaining daily record, although I already do this with a spreadsheet. I am very surprised it was developed by professional psychologists. Its like reading a Psychology Today magazine.

"i’ve been using this app going on 5 months now, and i can say with great certainty that it has been SUPER helpful. here’s some reasons why you may love this app, that i personally love.

1. you can keep track of your moods and see trends. like if you go somewhere that impacts your mood, you can see the trend over time.

2. the weekly updates are useful, but the bi-weekly ones are amazing. MindDoc let’s you know when it may be time to consult a therapist about your emotional health and gives in depth reasoning as to why. 

3. you can send the bi-weekly updates to your doctor and share your MindDoc with your therapist. i’m about to do this and may leave another review letting y’all know how it works and how it went.

4. it asks you relevant questions to anxiety and depression like how your appetite is, if you’ve been crying, if you’ve been thinking about death, have you felt a sense of achievement, and all that stuff. this comes into play when you get your bi-weekly results. it also gives you advice and resources on how to cope and manage your symptoms. 

5. there are readings and podcast sort of things that you can listen to that will give you information on depression, anxiety, and how to cope. more of these are available on premium, but there are many available on the normal version!

keep in mind, this is NOT the premium!!! i have not tried the premium because i am a broke college student, but this app is truly amazing and super helpful. i believe everyone can benefit from it. what i have listed above are just some of MY favorite things about the app. there are many more features too!

i hope all of you get the help you deserve and need. stay safe everyone! and if you ever feel like you’re in a crisis, text 741-741 or call the national suicide prevention hotline at (800) 273-8255. there’s also hotlines available in many other countries that you can look up.",5,2020-11-05 22:53:23,False,liamwhitney26,amazing app that everyone needs!!,minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,

There’s more free features on the iOS version than android which is cool! 

The questions i used to get on my Android weren’t as vague and repetitive as they are on iOS(even at the start).  Or as damaging. How many times do I have to answer “no” to a question before it gets out of rotation? Is there a way to tell the app to not ask specific types of questions? If not I think that’d be a really good feature to add.

The app itself is very easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. I’ve had some issues w my questions not appearing for me to answer on iOS but it’s probably  just user error.

"This app seems pretty good so far, despite the terrible “rate this app!” pop-up thing happening well before the setup/trial period ends. Haven’t had enough time with the app (per the app’s own constraints) to really give it a rating. So, minus a star for doing the rating-begging anti-pattern, and minus another for not popping the pop-up at a reasonable time.

Finally, there’s some weirdness in this app’s privacy policy. It says something about _not_ storing user data on-device because of security. That’s objectively backwards, and hints at a very naive threat model. This app also doesn’t let you protect yourself with FaceID; other similar apps allow for app-specific access control. EDIT: I found the setting, it wasn’t super intuitive. Consider exposing the gear icon beyond just the “discover” pane.

Finally, the privacy policy asserts that this information can’t be considered PHI because it’s anonymous; that’s a terrible and incorrect assumption. EDIT: adding bullet-points for specific responses to what the developer has pushed back on, below.

• The developer’s response that “saving the data via a randomized number not connected to anything” being good enough for PHI is dangerously wrong. Not on your server, or anyone’s server. Is that data encrypted at rest? Who has the key? Do you have any idea how classification of PHI even works? You do realize that your users can write anything they want into this dataset, and that it can be trivial to de-anonymize people based on just content, right? You’re advertising a safe space for people to bare their souls, but this point you’re trying to make here shows you’ve implemented the exact opposite. Lack of explicit identifying fields does NOT make this data anonymous, full stop.

• The developer’s response that “saving the data [...] on our servers is more secure” is simply not correct. Your servers are exposed to the internet as _servers_, for goodness sakes, while iOS devices are largely behind NAT and don’t generally run server software. Do your servers encrypt this data at rest? While in memory? Who has the keys? An iOS device goes to great lengths to protect its user’s data, and the _user_ has its keys. What exactly is your threat model, and has an infosec professional actually reviewed it for sanity?

• Re: the developer’s point about data size & loss: modern iOS devices have a tremendous amount of storage available to them. There’s also iCloud for storage and backups. Users can also do backups via iTunes. You’ve taken these more secure options off the table in favor of your single-point-of-failure server. And according to your data export feature, a .zip of my data is 2KB in size. Text is small and highly compressible; the argument that this app’s data is too big just doesn’t make sense. Unless... are data exports complete? Or are you not granting users access to all their data? How about allowing users to choose for themselves? I trust iCloud and my own set of devices _and_ their encrypted backup mechanisms far more than any random server on the internet.

The only thing that’s saving this app from a solid one-star review is it’s nice UX. There’s some good design thinking in this thing’s user experience, but the security and privacy aspects smell really bad. EDIT: after the developer’s responses, I’m even more wary of trusting any real data to this app; their stances on security and privacy are verging on dangerous, and they’re digging in on them.

To the MoodPath team: if you take security seriously, please take advantage of Apple’s iCloud and endpoint security rather than trying to do it yourselves. Or if nothing else, let users choose whether or not to trust your servers with their PHI. If there’s significant server-side processing that makes your servers _actually_ required, make that clear. Finally, saying your servers are secure without any evidence isn’t useful to anybody. Do you have a SOC 2 report you can show us? ISO 27001 certification by a 3rd party? Any other kind of _verifiable_ 3rd-party certification? “Just trust us” is less than useless; “trust but verify” is what’s needed here.

To all users: don’t use this app if you care at all about the confidentiality of any data you expose to it. Don’t connect it to Apple Health unless you want all sorts of data sucked out of your device and stored on MoodPath’s servers and shared with who-knows-who.",2,2020-02-02 19:20:13,False,Mattalogue,"Weird, concerning privacy policy",minddoc-your-companion,1052216403,"{'id': 13357285, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nand thank you very much for reaching out about this.
