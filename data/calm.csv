False,I am a teenager,2021-06-16 20:42:58,I am a teenager who would go to sleep after staring at the ceiling for about 30-45 minutes. I heard from somebody that I look up to that meditation was really good for you and that it helped her. Well for me I no longer just lay looking at the ceiling for more than half an hour. I did the sleep meditations and they really helped me and those are what I started with which is probably not how you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do it but there is no wrong or right way. I then got a little tired of the sleep meditations because I‚Äôd done them so much so then I used the soundscapes. I put a soundscape on every night before I go to sleep. I love them and love the fact that there is a sleep timer so that I can set a timer for like an hour which is well over the amount of time it takes me to fall asleep now but it‚Äôs nice to fall asleep to the sound and not have to worry about turning it off. I am also all about a healthy mindset and self care haha. So I did so many of the meditations on the little self care area (Which I love that they have that). I just recently started the ‚Äúhow to meditate‚Äù just to further understand what I‚Äôve been doing. I love it so far. I 1000% recommend this app for sleep problems or even if you‚Äôre bored in the summer and want to learn how to do something beneficial and something that could definitely help you in the long run. This was kinda a whole story but whatever hahaha. Anyways yea totally recommend this app!!!,5,#Princess üëë,calm,571800810,
False,"App is in accessible for blind user, buttons unlabeled",2021-04-29 00:01:18,"Hello, I really like the content on your app and it has really helped me to develop my practice. However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible. Thank you for your timely consideration and namaste. I look forward to working with you in making the meditation community more inclusive.",2,Apelli0727,calm,571800810,
False,My doctor recommended it to me and I love it,2021-02-06 05:53:07,"I‚Äôve always struggled with anxiety and not being able to calm down. All of the features which this app has to offer really help me when I‚Äôm studying (I like having soundscapes or music on), relaxing (breathing exercises or meditation), and getting ready for bed (sleep stories and body scans). It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. 

One suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I‚Äôm doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can‚Äôt focus on sleeping with my thoughts). If you guys made some soft spoken or any kind of podcast in which there wasn‚Äôt a lot of yelling and loud talking, I‚Äôd totally listen in. (I know there are some masterclasses and lesson type things available on the app already, but they‚Äôre just not podcasts)",5,Hobokittycat,calm,571800810,
False,My opinion about the calm app.,2021-03-24 04:42:49,"Dear-Publisher,I have had this app for year and I love it so much, it helps me a lot but I deleted the app and downloaded it back and I‚Äôm glad I did. I know you may not have the some opinion as me but I think this app is outstanding. If the creator or person that published this app sees this, I just wanna tell how thankful I am that you made this all because it helps a lot. I know that some of the stories cost money but it‚Äôs still worth downloading the app. I recommend listening to ‚Äúsleep paws‚Äù and ‚Äúthe secret lagoon‚Äù they are both amazing bedtime stories for all ages! There is no age policy for this app if you ask me I just think that there is only one thing that could make the app better which is making the stories a lower price or just making it cost 0 dollars itself because some of the stories look very interesting but I cannot read them because I have to do a trial and that‚Äôs the reason why umm giving this app 4 starts! So if the person who published this app sees this review I just wanna say thanks for making my life so much more easier but please Mack some of the stories more reasonable of price because I have read all of the stories which are the ones that don‚Äôt cost money.",4,nehdhdhennej,calm,571800810,
False,Love the app just one recommendation!,2021-05-01 16:02:25,"There‚Äôs so much to this app there‚Äôs bed time stories, breathing exercises, music, sessions to help relax, meditate, and help u sleep, there‚Äôs also (one of my favorites) where u can have a calming background when on or off your phone, they have quotes to help motivate you, there‚Äôs daily check in‚Äôs you can do, you can set timers and reminders for things and so much more! There is a free app trial but you do have to pay after the trial ends but I think in my opinion it‚Äôs worth buying the app! My one recommendation though is that I think the calm app should add some more journaling to the app something more than the check ins because I think journaling is a great way to help you feel your releasing your past or just writing how happy you are if that makes sense plus if it‚Äôs not to much maybe add something to remind you to get off your phone and go outside or do some focusing hour on school work or something like that. Overall the calm app is a great app and I totally recommend if you have anxiety, or are having trouble sleeping!

False,Great App-Needs a few little tweaks,2021-05-10 06:19:36,"Calm has great stories, meditations and more. I love it and have the full version. I love Anna Acton, Eric Braa, and other soothing voices. Some of them, however, are just a bit...jarring. I know everyone has different tastes but I like to listen to voices directing me during meditation or towards sleep that don‚Äôt jump out at me. Please, Calm, add more voices like Eduardo Ballerini, Ramon Tikaram, Chik√© Okonkwo, May Charters and Jerome Flynn. Cillian Murphy is a great guest sleep story teller but please don‚Äôt just use celebrities because of name value. They don‚Äôt all make good storytellers/meditation guides. Some write the stories and I am grateful to those who come up with such wonderful sleep stories for adults. The ones that travel back in time, especially aboard old trains are outstanding! Just curate the voices a little better because some of us are too sensitive to the nuances of voice to listen to many of the meditations/stories. That‚Äôs kind of a waste. I end up listening to the same ones over and over. Please make the sleep stories at least 35 minutes, too. For those of us who need longer to drift away. Thanks so much!",5,JoyfulBookDragon,calm,571800810,
False,I don‚Äôt feel alone,2021-01-20 03:30:19,"During this time of isolation due to the pandemic, my daughter suggested I download this app. She‚Äôs been using it for a while and has premium. I downloaded it and I‚Äôm using the free service for now. This usually is not my ‚Äúcup of tea‚Äú and thought I would just try it. I have had a lot of anxiety and feel isolated and alone. I signed up and they have a very nice welcome letter. I tried one of the meditations and it is current with the times, it‚Äôs very relatable and because of that it has helped a lot. When I received the second long letter which I‚Äôm sure is a form letter but very well done, it has made me feel as if I am part of a community and a family which I do not have. Thank you from the bottom my heart for this wonderful app. There are plenty of meditations to choose from when you are first starting out and don‚Äôt understand the reviews about not having free meditations. This is a great stepping stone for someone who is new to meditation and I for one am very grateful. Great app. The meditations really are working for me and I recommend this to anyone who needs a little calm in their life.",5,Lynne11,calm,571800810,
False,Awesome app!! Few Suggestions,2021-05-19 00:53:11,"I absolutely love your app! To the calm creators, I think they worked hard on this app..but there are some suggestions. For example, I know that these things and apps cost a lot to make..but please don‚Äôt squeeze the person who doesn‚Äôt want to buy or doesn‚Äôt have the money to buy supreme,(to listen to everything/everyone) it really isn‚Äôt that nice. People who need to relieve stress or anxiety or listen to the voices/stories they want to. I personally think there is quite a lot of things to listen on calm..for free. But not even close to premium. But just remember, I love your app, and a lot of people do too!! But just please raise the stories for the people who can‚Äôt pay..especially animal ones!! (Those are my favorite). I‚Äôm just giving some helpful feedback on your app..hope you use this advice and put it in an update! But if you don‚Äôt and don‚Äôt take a lot of the viewers advice or mine..some people might start deleting your app. Sincerely from a Calm User to the Calm Creators.",5,OceanLoverCalm,calm,571800810,
False,Helpful beyond description,2021-01-20 20:52:18,"I am very reluctant to use this type of apps. However, this one always called my attention and during my last insomnia crisis I decided to explore. Oh my God, this app is not just a help to sleep better but to Live better! It has been about 10 days since I started and I am in love with it. I am 58 y.o. Venezuelan Female, Medical Doctor, married to a Wonderful Woman - my Soul Mate- living in a foreign country. She is deep into meditation and I feel so behind but I met Jeff and he has  introduced me to meditation in such an easy and accessible way. I have attempted for many many year with others but I always fell asleep. Besides and like now, I am at work and have some boring stuff to do. I just have to look for some new music on the app to switch my mood and be able to ‚Äúkeep walking‚Äù. So, Thanks Jeff! and thanks the lady with the sweet voice- can‚Äôt remember her name!- and thanks to all the talented people that make possible this unbelievable tool. My year subscription is really worthy to be paid!",5,Venzuelan55yearOld,calm,571800810,
False,Great app! Would love to see a mood tracker added,2021-03-24 10:18:27,"This app is great! I love that I can customize the background picture and sounds. The background and sounds can still be present during the meditation if you set the settings to allow it. Otherwise, you could set the background sounds to silent during meditations. I love the daily calm and various meditations and sound scapes! I really appreciate that I can even set the length of calm sessions or body scans to fit my work day. The one thing I would add to make this app perfect is a mood tracker! They do have one but it doesn‚Äôt give good statistical data. I like to keep track of my mood and compare it weekly, monthly, and yearly. Having a line graph of sorts would help me track my mood better for my mental health goals. The lack of this one feature is why I still have a mood journal app that I keep forgetting to use. If the mood tracker in Calm was better at displaying patterns then I would just use this app for all my mindfulness, gratitude, reflection, and mood tracking. I really would like to see that feature added!",4,Smolliver,calm,571800810,
False,EXPENSIVE- AND WORTH EVERY PENNY,2021-05-09 10:08:53,"I‚Äôve bought and listened to at least twenty of these ‚ÄúSleepyTime Apps‚Äù and I‚Äôve learned a few things. Most of them are pretty cheeseball. Looping, cheap sound recordings that sound like they were recorded by your father‚Äôs cassette tape recorder from Sears, circa 1976. If those are the Chevrolets of the industry this is the Cadillac that they are ALL trying to rip off. I could go on about sound quality or originality but the real thing that sets CALM apart is that they never stop making themselves better, hiring more and more celebrity pros to come in and create their own new sleep songs, narrate their own bedtime stories. What makes CALM different is that they take most of that extra money you pay for their service and immediately re-invest it in the app, snowballing it, making it better every day. The CALM app that I will have a month from now will be better than the one I enjoy today. And they‚Äôve kept this simple formula for as long as they‚Äôve been in business. It works.",5,Dogman7x,calm,571800810,
False,Found my center and my sleep,2021-01-06 20:42:57,"First let me say that while some reviews have requested more diverse voices for the daily meditations, In my case, I wish Tamara‚Äôs voice was used for everything including sleep stories as it‚Äôs the perfect formula to center me. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but her sleep stories put me to sleep in seconds.

I could write a lengthy review, but to summarize, this app brings me to center when I use it every time. I am someone who is always analyzing everything, wakes up in the middle of the night stressed about work or bills or family things, and misses the quiet within myself. I generally have difficulty sleeping through the night. But when I commit to mediations and sleep stories, it completely does the trick. It‚Äôs unbelievable, and I was a disbeliever before a friend recommended meditation with a different app which led me to Calm. It has so many tools to calm and center me so that I can sleep, be more effective at work, be happier in relationships, and be at peace within myself.",5,Maarum,calm,571800810,
False,100% YES!!,2021-01-08 04:51:57,"So, I have had a difficult time sleeping ALLüëè MYüëè LIFE! When I decided to try Calm, I was a bit skeptical because I had tried so many different apps, skills, and techniques in the past, and NOTHING worked. I was still up for HOURS at a time each and every night, and waking up with 5-6 hours of sleep each and every morning. When I downloaded Calm, I did not have the membership. I was a bit disappointed with how little I could do, and how expensive the membership was. But the investment was worth it! The sleep stories and meditations have me asleep in 30 minutes TOPS (with the help of some anti-anxiety and sleep pills). I also have depression and anxiety, and the guided meditations are amazing! Every morning, I stretch with the guided stretches, and I do the Daily Calm and check-ins each day. No matter how dedicated to mindfulness and meditation you would like to be, this app is worth your time and money. I feel so much happier and more well-rested. I give an 11/10!",5,Alexa Pascal,calm,571800810,
False,Great but missing some features,2021-01-06 05:19:49,"I like the app and have had it for a week so far and the layout is easy to navigate. The only downside is that you can‚Äôt put anything in your queue to play. For instance if you do a 15 minute mediation and want sleep sounds to play during the night, you have to go back in your phone after meditation to choose the sleep sound and manually start it. It seems counter productive to me to have to go back into your phone after a sleep meditation to play sleep sounds. If this app would allow users to put things in a queue to play more than one meditation without having to break the practice or to play a sleep sound after meditation without breaking practice by allowing users to use a queue, it would be perfect. Especially since we‚Äôre paying so much for this app and it‚Äôs not necessarily cheap. Otherwise has
great features and numerous different options for a tranquil experience",5,Samlovesiphone,calm,571800810,
False,So disappointed lately,2021-04-02 14:07:37,"This app was fabulous originally, but they have ‚Äúimproved‚Äù some functions so they are not easy to use any more.  For example, we listen to the same Eric Braa episodes every night, but now they have moved them out of the instant display of my faves and buried them so I have to search for them in the middle of the night.  They no longer have new Eric Braa episodes and his voice is so soothing.  The recently used episodes should appear near the top of the category list so we can find them easily, not on the home page!  Give us a way to make our own category(s). Give us a way to remove all the children‚Äôs stories from the adult content.  Give us a way to totally delete content that is a trigger for us.  And finally, in the middle of the night, a dialog sometimes pops up that I have to put my glasses on to read so I can dismiss it!  That should NEVER happen.  I wish someone would listen.  I used to give feedback on each new story, but it never did any good so I stopped.  I don‚Äôt feel they listen anymore and I‚Äôm disappointed.",3,tanglepuffs,calm,571800810,
False,Charging me premium twice despite requests to stop,2021-01-25 05:22:50,"My toddler likes the Thomas the tank meditations. I got the premium subscription for $70 a year out of desperation to get my kiddo to sleep. Apparently I was pretty sleep deprived myself because I bought it twice, as explained by the company representative. One under the App Store and one online with an email. When I asked if she could stop one of them, she ghosted me. I still can‚Äôt seem to cancel one of them, and the other had been paid for the year anyway. It was one day until the free trial ended, and the rep refused to help me. Regardless of the content, which I don‚Äôt personally find helpful, I think ethically the company should not take advantage of people like that. I‚Äôve led groups on mindfulness meditation for years as a therapist, and I think this content is just okay. Search for mindfulness meditations and lots of free videos will pop up. Or try reading or listening to real mindfulness like jon kabat-zin. Glad some people find this app useful, but I wish I‚Äôd never signed up. Paying for two premium subscriptions I barely use (and the one I can‚Äôt find auto renews!), feeling duped.",2,mandifa419,calm,571800810,
False,Love Calm - can we have more anthologies please?,2021-04-16 16:27:29,"I‚Äôve had a couple of different doctors recommend Calm and finally decided to try it. I‚Äôve had chronic insomnia since childhood and was very skeptical, so I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The sleep stories are my favorite feature, but I often find that the story ends just as I‚Äôm drifting off, so I have to start another one, which completely wakes me up again. The anthologies have been great since they are longer and I‚Äôm more likely to be fully asleep when they end. Can we please have more long stories or anthologies?? Or could you develop a feature that allows me to queue several stories so I don‚Äôt have to manually start another?? If that feature already exists, please tell me how to find it and use it!! To those who complain about the cost...if you really cared about good sleep and how it benefits your health, you would think $5 a month is a bargain!!

False,Calm to the rescue!,2021-02-16 06:06:33,"I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without this app. I‚Äôm a life long somewhat insomniac that cannot fall asleep unless I have something that ‚Äúoccupies‚Äù my brain, so I can turn off all the junk I worry about. These stories are highly entertaining, and very interesting, yet calming at the same time. They‚Äôre also educational! I‚Äôve learned many things from around the world that I didn‚Äôt know before. Most nights I‚Äôm out after 2-5 minutes, but some take longer. If I wake up during the night, I simply start a new story and I‚Äôm asleep again. I have my favorite narrators too. I find that male voices with accents other than American (with the exception of Erik Brah and Alan Sklar) really lull me to sleep. I need a deep voice lol. Females with British, Asian, Indian accents are great for me too. There‚Äôs also calming nature sounds and spa music. I‚Äôve been using the Calm app for 2 years now and it never disappoints!

False,"Fewer Intrusive Pop-Ups, Please",2021-02-15 11:52:29,"I have the paid version, and particularly like the sleep stories. They work so well, I usually fall asleep before the story ends. Problem is, I might wake up again a few hours later and want to pick up the story where I left off. But instead, I see the ‚ÄúStill Awake?‚Äù pop-up window suggesting other stories I might try, or maybe a meditation, and a pop-up asking if I‚Äôd like to rate that session, keep track of streaks and stats, etc. No, I‚Äôd really just like to find the sleep story I was listening to, but it has vanished from my screen. Now I‚Äôve got to sit up in bed, grab my reading glasses, X out of the intrusive pop-ups, and scroll through to re-find the sleep story that was snatched away from me....leaving me not at all calm, but instead, annoyed and anxious, and now unable to fall back to sleep.

False,Helps with sleep & stress [attn devs],2021-01-28 13:22:39,"This is the best meditation app I‚Äôve tried. I use it 1‚Äì2 times a day. Great mix of content and teachers for different moods, goals, and time commitments. While the sleep meditations work for me, I find the sleep stories with celebrity narration too distracting and gimmicky to fall asleep to, but I know others users for whom this is their favorite feature. Calm offers a series of sequential programs for mindfulness skill-building: ‚Äú7 Days of ______,‚Äù where the next day‚Äôs content unlocks with the completion of the previous day‚Äôs. As a paying user, I wish there were a way to override this. I once exited a minute early, when the wrap-up was nearly over, because I had to leave, and the app made me redo that day to access the next meditation. Similarly, I just updated versions and lost three days‚Äô progress in a program. I think the only way to catch up is to let them play out with the volume off, which is a waste of time and energy.",4,JacquelynNaomiNYC,calm,571800810,
False,Wish I could buy some episodes,2021-03-02 11:22:43,"Has some lovely calming images and sounds, and the unlocked bedtime story to which I listened had a a soothing voice. There many unlocked sessions I would like to hear and wish the owners would at least give a sample of the voice and then allow me to purchase the episode to own it, rather than requiring  a pricey (for me) yearly  subscription, for which the product is forever gone when it runs out. I know subscriptions are becoming the way of the world, but still I resist!  I do believe people should be paid for their work; I‚Äôd just like to be able to actually purchase a product; I would rate five stars if they would allow this.

False,thank you Kaiser,2021-01-25 03:44:01,"I get premium content through Kaiser insurance (which has been the best part of their mental health services, but that‚Äôs a different review....). 

I am so incredibly grateful for it because I‚Äôve been using it for the past two months and it took me out a depressive episode. 

Jeff Warren‚Äôs content keeps me around. It‚Äôs because of his 30 day course that I‚Äôve finally established a meditation practice after years of sincere attempts. His approach is very human and relatable; I find sessions with his recordings much more fruitful since he sandwiches the nuggets of clarity between quiet moments. I‚Äôm able to ease into the session, instead of being urged into quietness then being lectured by Tamara..maybe that works for other people but it‚Äôs inaccessible to me. 

I also use the children‚Äôs meditations with my five year old daughter and the sleep stories when she‚Äôs having a hard time sleeping. I‚Äôm glad to share this experience and skill with her. I was fortunate to have an elementary school teacher show me how powerful meditation and journaling was at an early age, but didn‚Äôt have a way to reintroduce it into my adult life AND share it with my daughter till now.

Recently, when I needed my song that helps me fall asleep every once in a while, I went into the app to find it LOCKED for the first time EVER. When I clicked on it to try and play the song, (water falling by Kip Mazuy in ‚Äúnature melodies‚Äù) a pop up comes up talking about a 7 day free trial and then a monthly payment after that. Unacceptable. You can‚Äôt just take something that has been free for years and then all of a sudden make it into a paid service. I know it‚Äôs a small issue but I am livid about this. I literally cannot believe this. You have taken my only reliable song that puts me to sleep when melatonin won‚Äôt do the trick.

False,Are we helping people or hooking people?,2021-04-21 04:59:37,"‚ÄúA resource to help people‚Äù that‚Äôs what I thought CALM was. And so, reluctant to seek emotional help because it‚Äôs such a personal issue, I turned to this app. And because I don‚Äôt have the means to purchase the app I have no access to their help. There is such a refreshing trend of prioritizing mental health in this age. But that‚Äôs half of the battle to actually helping people. I‚Äôm sure this app has good intentions but there will be no change in the epidemic of mental health issues so long as help is unattainable for ALL people who need it, not just those that can pay. If I had the means, I‚Äôd pay for a therapist. But those who lack the means to meet with someone are also left behind in such an accessible app that has such capability to make a difference. So my review: I feel very hungry for the help that this app offers and I feel truly left behind. I am sorry for the many others who I‚Äôm sure have come here searching for help, as I did, only to find help (once more) unattainable. Do we care about actually helping people?

There‚Äôs so many things that cost money, and I get it, you guys should have some things that need to be paid for but I don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs literally only four things that‚Äôs free and why subscriptions cost so much.

Honestly, so many people in the world deal with stress and anxiety and this app could help them so much but they can‚Äôt because they would have to pay so much money. I get that the app needs to profit, but honestly the prices could at least be lowered a bit.

I love the content, the voices, and the variety for all general life challenges that might come up. I often use the search bar to find something I‚Äôm needing a booster for, and it has gotten me through a few anxiety / panic attacks, and even taught me to get better with them over time through these small habit changes. I love the sleep sounds & stories as well for unwinding at night. Along with some other major lifestyle changes, Calm has helped me live a healthier, more zen life.

Celebrity voices coupled with the technique of measured cadence and gradually diminishing volume are features that make this sleep aide unique and more effective than any of the many others that I‚Äôve tried.

I only wish there were a timer on the nature noise that comes in when the sleep story is finished,  as it is the ABSENCE of noise that eventually wakes me up in the morning, like the opposite of an alarm. I use silence as my alarm on another app and it works splendidly, and is not nerve wracking, like an alarm would be.

However, after years of satisfaction, an noticeable issue has come to my attention: More and more of the sleep stories are of a religious nature. At first the sleep stories were fantastic: funny stories, fairie tales, travelogues, poetry, even some to BORE you to sleep, like someone reading the rules of cricket! LOL 

But, for some reason, writings are containing more and more religious content and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm in a class on Religions of the World, when I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep. This falls into the category of ‚Äúpersuasive rhetoric ‚Äú and my brain is busy analyzing my own opinion s on the theology or philosophy that is presented, keeping me from resting.

But there‚Äôs so much more, and many meditations to choose from. I also enjoy the music without lyrics, and I‚Äôd like to see more of those. 

I think the only thing I take issue with is that my choices of meditations with voices are cut in half because I prefer femme/female higher voices than deeper male voices because of certain personal triggers. Other than that, this app is very helpful and there are still a lot of choices.

The interface is not good for sleepers.  Controls should be large, obvious and omnipresent.  Mucking around with controls is disruptive for sleep and for those of us who do not sleep with our glasses on, (read everybody) very frustrating.

The subscription model for this is very expensive.  The idea that new stories and content is an important aspect for sleep is flawed.  Good content does not need to be replaced as familiarity only helps with falling asleep.

My only gripe is that, for some odd reason, the developers have not  bothered to updated the Apple TV version.

TLDR: App is poorly designed; make sure you like Tamara Levits way of speaking before subscribing bc she‚Äôs 90% of the guided meditations:

1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings. Also, ever meditation has a huge picture which seems ok for people new to the app, but unnecessary for whose who just want to find what they're looking for. These things can easily be fixed and I hope they do something about it. 

2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt. I understand a lot of people probably like how she speaks (vocal fry, trying too hard to sound soothing), but I find it too distracting. So basically I can‚Äôt listen to 90% of the guided meditations.",2,Lfost917,calm,571800810,

False,Life-changing,2021-04-11 04:38:34,"I‚Äôve never written a single app review before but this one has helped me so much that I thought it only right to share my experience. About a year and a half ago I started going to a therapist for depression, anxiety, and general mental health issues. In that very first meeting with her she told me to take a proactive approach and a good way to do that is to try this app. She recommended buying the premium version and I did and honestly that was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made regarding my mental health. Now, I‚Äôm not going to sit here and say that my mental health issues are gone or that this app was a miracle cure. In fact, that‚Äôs far from the truth but I will say I use this app every single day and they‚Äôre constantly updating the content on there so that there‚Äôs something for pretty much anyone. The user interface is incredibly easy to use and you can always find whatever you‚Äôre looking for and they have a ton of options so you can try whatever looks cool. Meditation doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and that‚Äôs important to keep in mind before investing. However, if you think this app will even help you a little bit and you have 10 minutes every day to spare then I promise you won‚Äôt regret it. 
If you‚Äôve gotten this far into the review and you‚Äôve liked what I‚Äôve had to say so far then I might as well share my routine. I try to do the ‚Äúdaily calm‚Äù everyday which is always a 10 minute guided meditation and it‚Äôs different everyday. There are also so many short meditations to chose from and some of them can be for specific emotions or situations which can also be really helpful. Having an anxiety disorder (or really a disorder of any kind) makes it incredibly difficult to think in present time and focus on the present moment, but the meditations on here have made that less of an obstacle. The thing about meditation is that it grounds you while you‚Äôre doing it, but it also trains your brain to stay grounded in your daily life as well and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so often used to treat mental health issues and that‚Äôs why it works. 
I also use the app when I go to bed because they have sleep stories, meditations for bedtime, music, and white noise sounds that will play until you tell the app to stop. The section on sleep is probably my favorite part of the app because getting a healthy amount of sleep used to be a huge issue of mine and now my sleep schedule has gotten so much better. Honestly if all of the other meditations didn‚Äôt exist I probably still would‚Äôve bought the app solely because of how much it‚Äôs helped me sleep! That‚Äôs truly how awesome this section of the app is.

Despite my attempts to lower stress through exercise, a healthy diet, and time outdoors, I always found those techniques to be short-term solutions (I still do all the above in tandem with Calm by the way). I finally tried Calm after hearing and reading such positive reviews. Calm has not only met but exceeded my expectations. It definitely takes a personal commitment, but carving out even just 10 minutes for the Daily Calm has completely altered my mindset in just a few weeks. In few instances do I now use the word ‚Äústressful‚Äù to describe my day. Taking stock of my daily feelings and thoughts through a quick 1-minute reflection is enough for me to get in touch with what I‚Äôm most anxious about or grateful for. And then the meditations themselves are enjoyable, plentiful and highly effective! The quality is exceptional as well. I absolutely love the narrators, the categories (including bedtime stories, soundscapes, music, and traditional meditations), and the overall peace of mind that comes with this wonderful program. $70/year is so worth the price! Of course Calm is just the tool. You‚Äôre the one who will have to come to the table with an open mind and a ready heart willing to do the work, but doing so will yield tremendous value!

False,"AMAZING App, no difficulties",2021-04-06 22:09:17,"I love the app daily calm. There are so many amazing things about it, but here is a summarization:
Before I got this app, I seriously had sleeping problems. Like, it would take me and hour to fall asleep! So, I got this app, and it seriously helps me out with stuff, like I started listening to some of the sleep stories on here, and I fall asleep before the story ends every. Single. Time!!! There‚Äôs even a ‚Äúback to sleep‚Äù thing that helps you fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night randomly. (Which I find myself doing quite often)
Secondly, I also have some major anger problems. Like, I will scream over the littlest things. Sometimes, doing the breathing exercises in the app really helps me out with that and doing some of the meditation stuff on here helps with that as well. Also, I have the subscription on this app, which is TOTALLY worth it. It gives you access to more things I‚Äôm pretty sure, and it‚Äôs not way too much to handle. But then of course, I don‚Äôt know what the app is like without the subscription so if you don‚Äôt get the subscription I don‚Äôt know what to promise you. All I know is that with the subscription you get access to all of the different meditations, sleep stories, breathing exercises, etc... for 0$, as in completely free. So if you get the subscription, there‚Äôs that. 
Also, this isn‚Äôt one of those apps where it makes you rate the app right as you get it. Seriously, all these 5 star ratings are because it actually works. Also, if you are trying to go to sleep on this app at night, I recommend putting your phone on night mode and turning the darkness all the way down. (Because screens affect your sleep)
Overall, I highly highly recommend this app, and really hope that you end up getting it. ( especially if you are trying to solve sleep problems or just needing to relax )

False,Starting a free trial? Read this for a better experience.,2021-05-01 23:18:06,"Just be careful with your free trial. I wanted to see if this app would be useful for me. Turns out, I rarely used it in my 7 day trial, which is actually more like 5 days since you MUST cancel 24 hours or before the 7 days or you‚Äôll be charged $70 for the whole year, which I failed to do. Nope, you don‚Äôt automatically get charged for a $15 monthly plan, you get charged for the whole year if you fail to cancel your free trial. Lovely! But whatever, my fault. At least I can ‚Äúcancel anytime!‚Äù

Ok, well here‚Äôs my rant on the ‚Äúcancel anytime policy.‚Äù Sorry to say, but canceling anytime is a little play on words. Sure, you can indeed ‚Äúcancel anytime‚Äù like the app says. However, it‚Äôs useless. Canceling 364 days before the subscription ends, like I was in the process of doing, and canceling 1 day before the subscription ends, results in the same charge. Yep, you‚Äôre still getting charged the $70 for the year even if you cancel, like in my case, 18 hours into the year‚Äôs subscription. 

So what should you take from this? Just cancel your 7 day trial after 5 days or you‚Äôll be charged. And if you still want to use the app after the trial, I would STILL recommend canceling and then buying the monthly plan, at least to start. Because if after 1-2 months you no longer like the app, you‚Äôre stuck with paying $70. If you still like the app after a couple months, then upgrade to the yearly plan, which is cheaper then paying for 12 individual months. (You do this in Apple‚Äôs settings > tap your name at the very top > tap subscriptions > tap the ‚Äúcalm‚Äù app.

I purchased an annual subscription almost a month ago, and I have been using it daily. It‚Äôs very helpful in explaining how to mediate, guiding and teaching and the reasoning why it is so important. I mainly purchased it because I have daily struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep. I really do wish there was an option with volume control, this is a major issue for me! I have to turn the volume on my phone down, and if/ when I do fall asleep, I don‚Äôt wake up to my alarm or calls. 

Calm WOULD BE PERFECT and 100% better if there was the ability to change the volume of the voice on meditations and background sounds on the app alone, not having to change my entire phone volume! I have another sleep app that is free (with option to upgrade) with sounds to fall asleep to and it has ‚úÖa mixer, allowing me to not disrupt my phone volume, just controls the volume directly on the app. ‚úÖ I feel that there is no reason Calm should not have something like that. If I keep the volume at where my iPhone is already set to, it is extremely loud, to the point I can hear meditations or sleep sounds through earplugs! Because I mainly use this for sleep, this has been a HUGE ISSUE and I BEG THE DEVELOPERS TO IMPROVE THIS AND INCORPORATE an IN APP VOLUME CONTROL!!! Other than the volume issue, I really do enjoy Calm, but I do wish I would have done the free trial before purchasing an annual subscription. I don‚Äôt think I would have purchased, especially not an annual subscription, in retrospect. I definitely won‚Äôt renew if they don‚Äôt incorporate in app volume control.

False,Very pleased!,2021-05-04 05:08:16,"CALM app, is a must for everyone! Kids, teens, men, women, it‚Äôs for all! 

Quick summary, early on in my marriage, I learned of my anxiety, after our first born I learned of my depression. Either of those alone aren‚Äôt easy to manage, then add the info below... Who wouldn‚Äôt need CALM in their life?

I am a mother to 7 children and wife. I never imagined having this many children, nor would I have guessed our ‚Äúfifth‚Äù pregnancy would turn out to be spontaneous triplets. 
 
The amount of changes in our life in such a small window of time, sent my struggle with Anxiety and Depression into a fast spiral of mental breakdown. After seeking professional help, my husband knew a bit of CALM at home, on the go and walking was needed for this mama! He decided (upon my request) this app was worth the investment and gifted it to me. Let me say... Seven children (triplets) on a small salary. 

I have really enjoyed the CALM app, it‚Äôs helped me in so many areas of my life. 
-My favorite part is the NEW content all.the.time! My other favorite is the meditation for beginners and pros. I have enjoyed learning how to meditate. The way husband describes it is, it‚Äôs teaching me how to go into my nothing box - like men. (YouTube: men and their nothing box.) Yes, yes, yes it does! I LOVE IT! Have you ever just wanted to silence the world or sit quietly in a crowded room and people watch!? Having no worry or care in the world about what is going on around you!? This app is so good at guiding you through your thoughts and feelings or allowing you the freedom to hear the wind in the trees, ocean sounds at sea, the crackling of fire and more. It‚Äôs amazing being taught how to slow down, love my inner self and sit listen to my own breathing. I definitely feel this app is for EVERYONE, especially for those struggling with mental and emotional thoughts. 

This app is pricey, but having had the app since 2018ish - till now; we have been sent many coupons from the creator to continue it - at great discounted rates. It no doubt saved us a lot of money in the long run by simply signing up once and paying the amount requested (they hook you up!). 

My only complaint is listening to female narrators. It‚Äôs so so so so so not my favorite! We need men narrators as a second option - more often! I‚Äôm not sure why or how, but the men narrators provide me more relief than the women. I definitely prefer listening to the calming voice of men in this CALM app. Hope this helps! üíú",5,Jams2nd None,calm,571800810,

Now it‚Äôs big business. And I mean BIG. Yeah, they have a ‚Äúfree‚Äù version but the vast majority of content will set you back $69.99 a year!

Downloaded this after one of the panic attacks I started getting in year 3 (I don‚Äôt have anxiety... just years of stress with little sleep) and never looked back. This platform has made mindfulness accessible to a much larger audience - nothing in here is ‚Äúnew‚Äù per se, the differentiator is in the breadth and depth of their practices, how clean and professional they are (no more risky clicks on YouTube), and how much variety is included.

There is music, guided meditation, stretching, stories, soundscapes and more that I haven‚Äôt even used yet. All of the material is tailored - for a certain level of user (neophyte to expert), a certain situation (stress, anxiety, sleep, city life, etc.), or a given amount of time.

This app is what you make of it. Take it from someone who has never practiced meditation before and even doubted it‚Äôs efficacy, an investment banker so focused on achievement that he abused his body and mind for years. This app is a lifesaver, maybe literally

False,"Considering pricing structure, should be better",2021-02-28 19:02:36,"The app is fine. Just fine. It has quite a few hiccups with audio pausing randomly (when using AirPods Pro on-hear controls), and this baffles me, as even cheaply made freemium apps have no problem with this.

My issue is with the content vs. pricing structure. The subscription is annual. That‚Äôs it. No monthlies or quarterlies. Annual, with a 7-day trial.

The problem is... this app still feels very much like it was released years ago, on a Verizon Droid phone (the ones with the big clock and weather on Home page). There is that suspicious, rough-around-the-edges ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù that just screams ‚Äú2012!!!‚Äù

As for the content, most of it, except the Calm-exclusive stories and ambient sounds, is available on Spotify or Apple Music (or Deezer or etc etc etc). So you‚Äôre paying a flat $70 for an app that still feels like it is milking a business model created in 2016 (but it‚Äôs been 5 years), while also paying for that same content on your preferred music streaming service. Think about that for a moment, and now think about the pricing structure.

Imagine paying an annual fee for Safari (even if the fee were $50), so that you could ‚Äúask website not to track you.‚Äù That‚Äôs what this feels like at times.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. The stories are nice. The ambient sounds are nice and high quality. But that‚Äôs it. I think a reassessment of both, the UI experience and products offered, and the pricing options, could go a long way. That is, if the execs at Calm Inc. still find their vision viable.

False,"I enjoyed the trial, but cannot relax to narrator's voice",2021-02-26 10:33:06,"I finally tried calm! The sleep story ads I'd get on Youtube helped my anxiety at times, and now that I am practicing mindfulness and meditation consistently, I figured I'd download it to sort of help me get the basics. I can say I really enjoyed the ""How to Meditate"" series, and the layout is very pretty and simple, but that was all I could really get into. 
With all due respect, I found the main narrator's voice more distracting and bothersome than relaxing. I found myself getting slightly startled or jumping whenever she spoke up throughout meditations that were meant to help me sleep. This never happened with other guided meditations I've followed or with my hynotherapist, who've all had soothing voices. I tried changing narrator, as suggested by Calm, but on all of the meditations I've been using, there are no other voice options. 

Meditation aside, the other features on the app are nice, however, I can find soundscapes and peaceful music on Youtube, Spotify or other free soundscape apps.

There have been numerous reviews posted stating this same thing about the latest update and we, your users (many of us, like myself, paid Premium users) are frustrated and the developers at Calm have not responded to a single review regarding this latest update which has caused the app to be rendered completely useless. At the very least, the developers at Calm should be responding to the myriad of disgruntled customers of the Calm app regarding when a fix update is to be expected, or if a fix is even being worked on. That‚Äôs just basic customer service 101. Yet, it‚Äôs nothing but radio silence from the Calm app developers. 

I am a Premium paid subscriber and have used, and loved, Calm for quite a number of years. I specifically use Calm for the soundscapes to fall asleep to every single night. However, Calm is not the only app which offers these soothing soundscapes and if you Calm developers don‚Äôt start responding to us, your users who have built your app into the very popular app it has become, we will start canceling our subscriptions and use other very similar apps with nearly identical features who also provide basic customer service to their users, something you at the Calm app are sorely lacking!

A week ago, prior to the update which killed the app from launching and then seeing that nobody from the Calm app was acknowledging the upset users of the Calm app, I would have given the app 5 stars... after this PR debacle I would give you ZERO STARS if I were able to, as you at the Calm app have shown just how little you care about your users and their experience with your app. Shame on you, Calm!",1,The Puddle Town Girl,calm,571800810,"{'id': 21407268, 'body': 'So sorry for the trouble you\'ve experienced!

False,Customer Service/Cancellation Request,2021-02-11 10:32:02,"I used to love using this app, but found myself using it less and less due to scheduling conflicts. For context, I used to have an android when I started using the app, and switched to Team iPhone at the end of 2019. Around the Summer of 2020, I struggled with the thought of cancelling my subscription because I really love the app, but I wasn‚Äôt using it at all. Finally in December of 2020, I heartbreakingly submitted a request through my Apple Subscriptions to cancel and remove the App. It is now February 2021, and after a month of not receiving any charges from the Calm App, I figured all was well. I was sorely mistaken. When I reached out to their customer service team yesterday, no one was available to reach out and get any information on my cancellation request. This morning at 1:00 am, I get an email from Valerii in the Customer Care department explaining the pending charge process, and that my service will be cancelled as of today. Even after explaining the circumstances of my original cancellation she was extremely rude and essentially stated that it was my fault that the subscription wasn‚Äôt cancelled, despite following the cancellation instructions for Apple products, which is listed on their website. I am now in the process of contacting their corporate offices and have reported them to my bank. Bottom line: make sure you cancel your subscription before getting an iPhone, or they will continue to charge your card through Google!",1,Atiana Monique,calm,571800810,

You‚Äôll probably get 1 unlocked lesson & that‚Äôs it. Which everyone knows 1 single 10 minute lesson is not nearly enough to see noticeable improvement. There are not even any 100% free modules unless you‚Äôre just doing breathing or a timed meditation (& if you never meditated before or are using your 1 free lesson to help guide you, it can be confusing).
