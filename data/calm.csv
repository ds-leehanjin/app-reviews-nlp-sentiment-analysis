#Princess üëë,5,2021-06-16 20:42:58,I am a teenager,I am a teenager who would go to sleep after staring at the ceiling for about 30-45 minutes. I heard from somebody that I look up to that meditation was really good for you and that it helped her. Well for me I no longer just lay looking at the ceiling for more than half an hour. I did the sleep meditations and they really helped me and those are what I started with which is probably not how you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do it but there is no wrong or right way. I then got a little tired of the sleep meditations because I‚Äôd done them so much so then I used the soundscapes. I put a soundscape on every night before I go to sleep. I love them and love the fact that there is a sleep timer so that I can set a timer for like an hour which is well over the amount of time it takes me to fall asleep now but it‚Äôs nice to fall asleep to the sound and not have to worry about turning it off. I am also all about a healthy mindset and self care haha. So I did so many of the meditations on the little self care area (Which I love that they have that). I just recently started the ‚Äúhow to meditate‚Äù just to further understand what I‚Äôve been doing. I love it so far. I 1000% recommend this app for sleep problems or even if you‚Äôre bored in the summer and want to learn how to do something beneficial and something that could definitely help you in the long run. This was kinda a whole story but whatever hahaha. Anyways yea totally recommend this app!!!,False,calm,571800810,
IamSporkette,5,2020-12-06 05:17:39,Ummm,"I updated the calm app and just out of curiosity I read some of the reviews.  I have been using the app for a while off and on, and love it.  I was curious what other people thought, and I don‚Äôt understand the critical apps.  Most are complaining that there is ‚Äòno free content‚Äô and you have to pay to get anything.  So I looked at the website without logging in just to see, since I‚Äôve been a paying customer for several years.  Nothing personal reviewers, but that‚Äôs just not so.  There are at least 4 series that you can do, some of which I‚Äôve done and found very good.  There are a smattering of sleep stories, some music, and I gave up after looking at master class and finding them all unlocked.  Yeah, there is a lot that is locked, but there is more than enough to get the experience, and no reason to look at it and say it stresses you out because it‚Äôs all behind a paywall like so many of the critical reviews say.  

It‚Äôs a very well done app.  I‚Äôve been using it for several years and still have barely scratched the surface of what‚Äôs available, and there‚Äôs always new stuff, and a new daily calm every day.  Yeah... it costs a bit, but it averages out to about 5 dollars a month, and you never run out of content, and it‚Äôs good quality.  Isn‚Äôt that worth it?  I think so.",False,calm,571800810,
YourLocalCalmUser,3,2020-09-21 22:38:20,Calm Review,"I really don‚Äôt like how you have to pay to get good stuff. That makes me stressed which takes away the purpose of the app Calm. Now, I understand that, with all of the items this app has, it has to cost money, but maybe, you could make more stuff free, like maybe a seven day program or something. Maybe that would hook more users and convince them to pay for the rest. Just a thought. Without paying, the only things you really can do are the daily check ins, the little reflection thing, and a timed meditation. Once someone gets bored of that, they‚Äôll probably delete the app. You need a better way to get their attention. For example, I got the Sleep Cycle app, and I am very happy about it. It does have things that cost money, but not nearly as much money, or as many things that need money as Calm does. Most of the things in Calm cost a lot of money, and the things that are free are the things that aren‚Äôt the most helpful. Maybe this is an advertisement tactic? I‚Äôm not sure. However, in the Sleep Cycle app, the only thing that costs money is the Statistics which, honestly, I probably wouldn‚Äôt use that much. Also, it‚Äôs a lot cheaper. The things you can do without money are really cool; download the app to check it out! Over all, I have to give Calm three stars because of this, and it‚Äôs not just because it costs money, but also because of the amount of things that cost money and how much it costs.

UnluckyLadybug,3,2020-12-08 16:02:24,Ad Recommendation,"I just wanted to leave a recommendation.  There was an ad I got where you seemed to be walking down a hall that always turned right.  The walls seemed really close on both sides.  That is terrifying.  In fact, people purposely do that in horror games to create terror.  Just want to let you know, and this is coming from a psychology student.  I seriously thought something was gonna pop out at me and when I heard it was an app called ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù I was worried you guys knew nothing of the sort.  Terror is suspense, terror is build-up and a feeling that something is there.     That‚Äôs what makes good horror games.  But not an ad to help with anxiety, I can tell you that much.  It made me so scared!  Haha.
When I checked your app, I loved the aura.  I loved the colors.  But I also have to say this.  If you‚Äôre gonna add all these extra expenses, just put it out for that amount.  If you make this downloadable on different consoles and platforms, you have more excuses to put it out for an amount too.  Some consoles and platforms have all their apps at an expense.  I can appreciate your business and understand if you want a profit (who doesn‚Äôt.). Just, being up-front is better than saying ‚ÄúUnlock this app you just downloaded‚Äù basically.
I know nothing of business, though.  I just know that I‚Äôm cheap.  The free trial is a good idea, but understand people have other options, and everyone is struggling during this time with money, too.",False,calm,571800810,
calm girl10,5,2020-04-11 13:11:09,So relaxing and amazing,"I absolutely love love love this app!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è once I could not go to sleep so I turned on some of the calm music and I fell asleep 10 minutes later. I was amazed. I have been getting better sleep since than. Also whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious about someone or something, I listen to one of the daily calms or the next day on the meditation trial. Right away it‚Äôs as if you were brought into some beautiful relaxing world where there are these voices saying ‚ÄúIt will be ok no matter what. This will pass.‚Äù And it does its amazing how calming and peaceful this app is. Next, mood check in. The mood check in helps me express and release good and bad feelings and thoughts. Enjoy the good ones and let go of the bad ones. It even gives you a chance to write a little about them. It‚Äôs like your own personal diary, but way better. Last but definitely not least, I Believe this app can make you a better person. To be happier, to live life longer. It can be a real life changer. And just know that it‚Äôs never to late to start fresh again.  It‚Äôs never to late to change yourself. But most of all, it‚Äôs never to late lo be the big change in the world, that you have wished for. And calm can help with all of that. This is a total recommendation for anyone.",False,calm,571800810,
CaylieHan,4,2020-05-24 19:52:55,"Sleep, anxiety, & life saver all in one app","Honestly, I had come to a point in my life where I insomnia and anxiety were at an all time high , I was on anxiety meds, sleep meds, anything they could do to try & get my anxiety and insomnia under control & even when the pills weren‚Äôt really helping, I decided to try this app out because even doctors had recommend it, while yes- price tag can seem like a lot, BUT I used this one night while my anxiety was setting in and I was asleep half way through the sleep story and when I woke in the morning I was in disbelief. Nothing, I mean nothing had helped me until I found this app. The meditation & sleep stories are amazing. I am so grateful for this app. Now, the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars would be due to a recommend I have for the creators, they should create a watch or something that can track your sleep & in the morning provide meditations, music, sleep stories that reflected how you slept the night before. For example, if someone woke up a lot, or of people were waking up frequently and having a hard time going back to sleep &  maybe making suggestions for  a meditation they could choose that one as more personal, or for anxiety with sleep or sleeplessness, things like that. I don‚Äôt know that would be my only recommendation, but overall and amazing app that‚Äôs worth the price.",False,calm,571800810,
nmbr1sk8r,4,2020-12-03 06:15:22,Great but needs more voices,"I love this app and use it all the time. Loads of new content added constantly. The length of the meditations is perfect. I love the series like 7 days of calm, 7 days of sleep, etc. the breathing exercises are so helpful. 

One area for improvement would be that currently most of the meditations, especially new content, is narrated by the same woman. It would be really helpful if these same sessions were recorded with a male voice, so listeners could have an option.  It would also be helpful if there were a more diverse selection of voices throughout the meditations. (This is done in the master classes and sleep stories, but I‚Äôd like to see it in the meditations too). A second area would be a review of the content of the gratitude meditations, which make assumptions and are therefore injurious for some listeners. For example I am in the middle of fighting a long term disease. Suggestions like you should be grateful for your health are not helpful and actually harmful for me. I‚Äôd really like to cultivate more gratitude but I can‚Äôt get through any of these meditations without being triggered. A review by someone working with diverse populations could help this. 

Other than this, I love the app. It has been designed so well and my mental health has improved dramatically since starting to use it. Highly recommended!",False,calm,571800810,
amberkaymccoy,5,2020-01-27 00:56:42,Helping High School Students Stay CALM,"I am a high school teacher at a high preforming high school in my area.  My students are often so stressed out and sleep deprived I feel so helpless to help them.  This year I decided to dedicate one day a week to meditating before we started class.  We do this every Thursday for the first 10-15 minutes of class. The response has been so positive from my students I am thinking of doing it two days a week next year.  The students LOVE Thursday!!  They have told me it‚Äôs the favorite part for their week.  Some students have even gotten the app for themselves.  I have heard so many times this year, ‚ÄúI needed that!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI needed to hear that today.‚Äù  After on session one of my boys said, ‚ÄúMan I was so upset about losing those 5 points on my English test and now I have let it go.

Apelli0727,2,2021-04-29 00:01:18,"App is in accessible for blind user, buttons unlabeled","Hello, I really like the content on your app and it has really helped me to develop my practice. However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible.

a ds42gme,3,2020-06-24 04:02:44,Pls read,"Dear calm, 

I have had your app since my middle school years. I‚Äôve got to say, your app was AMAZING with 15 sleep stories and 2 and 1/2 meditations, this wasn‚Äôt a problem for me because I also use headspace. Yes, they're your competition but I wasn't choosing sides. Anyways, over time you guys added feature that you really focused on for 2 weeks at a time and just gave up on it. Next, you decreased the amount of sleep stories which was ha a huge problem for me because I was NOT getting enough sleep to keep my grades up. It got so bad that I stole my mother's phone just to sleep (she Had the Premium subscription). So I was like, ‚Äùok, I'll just use headspace ONLY for sleep and calm for meditation. Then, you took away the 7 days of calm AKA: YOUR MAIN TRIAL AND ONLY TRIAL MEDITATION LEFT after you premiumfied the 7 days of something (forgot). I mean like BRU, I have other options. I started using headspace which is a great alternative if you don't have much money. I recommend bringing back some stuff from premium and reduce the price. To counteract this, put one 15 second ad at the beginning. Of every session of meditation for people without premium. Therefore, there is more than one reason to get it and it's CHEAPER. That's a win-win situation. I hope you come to the right decision. Whatever it is, I probably wouldn't stop using the app. Thank you for your time.",False,calm,571800810,
SweetnessandLight,5,2020-10-08 14:01:42,Review of Calm,"I really am indebted to Calm for working in my life during this pandemic helping me w my emotions, sleep help and maybe keeping me at a level arresting the memory decline that seemed to be coming on w it‚Äôs debilitating force. (I don‚Äôt use words like fighting it because most things should not be put into adversarial roles)
     I wish I had more from our guide Jeff on how to meditate. I really relate to his presentation because he seems quintessentially California to me.  I‚Äôve been meditating since I was 6 or so, brought up Vedantist Hindu, born Jewish and am now a ChristianI am an aging hippie. I meditate w my cat on my lap, I simply press my hands on her sides and she grounds me and then is the anchor; her occasionally purring.  
     I love the pictures and the nature scenes. By the way I have been meditating every single day since November.  If I might be of assistance, I‚Äôm not sure how maybe I could do a Spark or something. I wish there were Something way to dialog - I have been on the site.  Maybe I could look more deeply into community of Calm. Thanks for saving my life as a process. This is one place I like to be every single day (sometimes night)

Hobokittycat,5,2021-02-06 05:53:07,My doctor recommended it to me and I love it,"I‚Äôve always struggled with anxiety and not being able to calm down. All of the features which this app has to offer really help me when I‚Äôm studying (I like having soundscapes or music on), relaxing (breathing exercises or meditation), and getting ready for bed (sleep stories and body scans). It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. 

One suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I‚Äôm doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can‚Äôt focus on sleeping with my thoughts). If you guys made some soft spoken or any kind of podcast in which there wasn‚Äôt a lot of yelling and loud talking, I‚Äôd totally listen in.

The narrators are wonderful & plentiful so if one doesn‚Äôt cut it for you, you can change. There is also calming sounds, perfect sleep stories and A daily check in to see how you feel and offer suggestions on what might help. Their Master classes are great for learning things like mindful eating, better sleep, how to relax, and even improving your performance in life. All star narrators like Lebron James, Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu, Bindi Irwin, Bob Ross, Jerome Flynn, Leona Lewis, Jason Kidd & more read sleep stories & give advice on how to improve aspects of your life. Sabrina Carpenter & Sam Smith give music mixes to help you sleep or relax.

There is no age policy for this app if you ask me I just think that there is only one thing that could make the app better which is making the stories a lower price or just making it cost 0 dollars itself because some of the stories look very interesting but I cannot read them because I have to do a trial and that‚Äôs the reason why umm giving this app 4 starts!

I put down the book and played Day 2 - How to Meditate on this app I had just downloaded yesterday.   I am now finding my Homebase, through the calming inspiration narrated by Jeff Warren, and when I opened my eyes I was filled with such peace in this moment (now 5am) that tears welled up.  I embraced this expression of my self and felt pure joy.  This moment demanded a review of this app that I am grateful to invest in after my 7 day trial.  Everything else I enjoy about the logistics, user-friendly UI, and clean beauty of the app itself are all cherries on top of what I gained internally after only two days of meditating...breathing...feeling.  Thank you, developers.  I am humbly grateful for your inspirations.

I also tried the free background soundtracks and music when I was trying to concentrate. All worth the price of free admission. But then I tried the mediation. I‚Äôd always thought of meditation as new age mumbo jumbo. But many of the smartest people I know all have stories about when they started doing it and how it changed their life. So on a uncharacteristically unbusy Saturday I decided to try the meditation course. And now I realize how simple and profound it all is. It‚Äôs essentially just having then skill to not let your thoughts control how you feel. Not letting your emotions get the best of you. Once you can control your impulses, you are a different person.

I have tried several guided meditation apps and am always open to the possibility of finding another one to add to my options for meditating alone. I could not open the app the first time without agreeing to be charged a subscription at the end of a one-week free trial. The app then asked me a few questions to try to determine what to recommend ‚Äî how familiar I am with meditation, how often I meditate, and what I‚Äôd like to focus on in guided meditation. It then recommended I try a one-week course on stress. I figured I would give it a try, but I did not make it 60 seconds into the very first lesson before the person leading the meditation falsely claimed that a variety of physical chronic illnesses are *caused by* stress, the same utter garbage that some people claimed to me way back when I was diagnosed over 20 years ago. I immediately stopped the course but decided to try something else before giving up on the app. I tried a few of the daily meditations, but like another recent reviewer, I found the style of the person who always leads them doesn‚Äôt really mesh with my style.

So it‚Äôs a bummer that I‚Äôm missing out on all the content recorded by her, but I am still getting a lot of use out of the app anyway. Narrating is a talent, and although not everyone is a natural at it or blessed with a soothing voice, it can be improved on with proper training, and talented narrators work on their ability to even out/lower their pitch, and avoid raspy breaking in their tone as these are the most bothersome sounds to human ears.

There is a free app trial but you do have to pay after the trial ends but I think in my opinion it‚Äôs worth buying the app! My one recommendation though is that I think the calm app should add some more journaling to the app something more than the check ins because I think journaling is a great way to help you feel your releasing your past or just writing how happy you are if that makes sense plus if it‚Äôs not to much maybe add something to remind you to get off your phone and go outside or do some focusing hour on school work or something like that.

Another thing Jeff taught me: you don‚Äôt measure how effective/useful meditation is based on how many times your mind wanders when you sit, you look at how often and how smoothly  you  find yourself applying the concepts and activating the muscles you gain from sitting. The number of times I smile and notice something in a typical day is in the dozens. This app has definitely enriched my daily experience.

While this app is great as is, I do have some suggestions that could improve it even further and bring it to the next, absolute highest level: 0) allow for bookmarking, or better yet, make the app remember where you left off in a particular story if you try a different story half way through, but then decide to go back or if you close the app and want to go back to that story you started 1) allow the user to preset the ‚Äòstop time‚Äô on longer meditations/stories. 2) allow sorting of all content by length of time 3) allow stitching of different clips (i.e. so users can piece together their own content from existing clips).

Madelyn Michelle,2,2020-08-06 16:00:55,Most meditations guided by the same person,"After having calm for several months now, I‚Äôve enjoyed exploring to the variety of content from masterclasses to music to meditation. I also like the approach calm takes in encouraging you to develop your own daily practice of mindfulness. However, the main reason why I purchased calm was for the large library of meditations. However the bulk of new meditations come from the daily meditation which is always guided by the same person, Tamara Levitt. She also guides many of the meditation series they have available. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt enjoy how Tamara does her meditations and I find them more distracting than helpful. Because of this I find myself avoiding her meditations and whenever there is a choice for another voice I‚Äôll pick it, but there are only so many of these. And, if you‚Äôre not doing the daily meditations, it doesn‚Äôt take too long before you feel like you‚Äôre running out of content. Calm is great if you enjoy Tamara‚Äôs meditations, but your kind of out of a deal if you don‚Äôt. I just think its unfortunate that there isn‚Äôt more variety in the voices available and authors coming out with new content.

It‚Äôs been very helpful to me with managing sleep and anxiety, really to life-changing levels. But I find my biggest complaint and the thing that makes me go through bouts in which I stop using it altogether is the lack of variety in narrators. Tamara Levitt is used to narrate a very large number of exercises and while her voice is positive and upbeat‚Äîshe really is lovely, I‚Äôm sure!‚Äîit‚Äôs not AT ALL relaxing and totally grinds on my nerves. I literally cannot listen to any audio that she does in this app and as I said, there are many. It‚Äôs really disappointing. I‚Äôve found the male narrators, specifically Elisha Goldstein, have a slower cadence and a much more relaxing tone that allows me to decompress and stop my anxiety attacks or drift off to sleep.

Only the free portion (accessible for 1 week) can be shared‚Äîwhich is of course unnecessary since family members don‚Äôt need family share for something that is already free.  Family members would actually be better off downloading it directly because the free access only lasts one week so they‚Äôd at least get their own trial period instead of whatever remains of a family member‚Äôs.  There is fine print in the App Store which says that Family Share does not support in-app purchases and subscriptions, but nothing in the app itself will tell you that your $70 one year subscription cannot be shared with a family member or significant other.

However, this is no longer the case which I found out when it asked me to review my subscription & before doing it decided to checkout what was available, which truly disappointed me. If you don't pay you‚Äôll have access to a very limited programs. I understand the app needs to make money but, as with many things that gain popularity, it shifted from helping others to now make money.

The meditations, sleep stories, and ambient noise have all helped me tremendously.  I‚Äôm getting the best sleep since I can remember.  

I do have one suggestion, though.  As they are meant to do, the sleep stories often get me to sleep, but once the story ends, it is just silence.  The ambient noise helps me to stay asleep, but I can‚Äôt find a way to have the ambient noise begin once the sleep story or meditation session ends.  It would be great to be able to make a playlist of sorts where ambient noise automatically kicks in at the end of the sleep story or meditation session. That way, if I‚Äôm already asleep or very close to it, there is no need to go back into the app to turn on ambient noise, risking the light from my phone putting back to an awaken state.

However for the way I use calm there is one major shortfall in the app. There is no way to line up a queue or playlist of recordings. I will make it to the end of a sleep story, be close to sleep but not quite there and then have to search through the app again to turn on my soundscape. I know this doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal but for me who has always had trouble falling asleep it is very disruptive. It is also disruptive when I use the app to help my 10 yr old son fall asleep- I put on a sleep meditation for him, but he always wants a sleep story to follow. I either have to stay in his room through the whole meditation so I can start the sleep story, or he has to climb down from his bunk bed to do it, disrupting the calm we just established with the meditation.

I like that the meditations do focus a lot of physical sensations such as muscle tension and breathing because I do deal with physical sensations caused by anxiety. In my abnormal psychology class, we learned about the importance of slowing down and breathing.

If those are the Chevrolets of the industry this is the Cadillac that they are ALL trying to rip off. I could go on about sound quality or originality but the real thing that sets CALM apart is that they never stop making themselves better, hiring more and more celebrity pros to come in and create their own new sleep songs, narrate their own bedtime stories. What makes CALM different is that they take most of that extra money you pay for their service and immediately re-invest it in the app, snowballing it, making it better every day.

Daily Calm has taken the ‚Äúugh‚Äù out of meditation for me. It helps me slow my mind down. It helps me sleep and/or get back to sleep. It helps me with anxiety when it comes up. It guides me through certain difficult situations. I love the tools that are added. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the Spark conversations.  I like the daily check in feature - it helps me get grounded on my current state of mind. I love the gratitude checklist. The new daily reflection feature allows me to put the mindfulness to work in my relationships with myself and others. The various meditation series are also really helpful. There are series on gratitude, emotional resilience, mindful eating .... there are so many!

I don‚Äôt know what it is, but her sleep stories put me to sleep in seconds.

I could write a lengthy review, but to summarize, this app brings me to center when I use it every time. I am someone who is always analyzing everything, wakes up in the middle of the night stressed about work or bills or family things, and misses the quiet within myself. I generally have difficulty sleeping through the night. But when I commit to mediations and sleep stories, it completely does the trick.

However, for the days when I feel like I don‚Äôt want as much instruction, or the days when I need a two minute meditation, or the days when I think a walking meditation could be fun, Calm always seems to have something. They really mastered the balance between simple and dynamic in their design. I also really appreciate the new reflection feature, which I wouldn‚Äôt take it vantage of it if they didn‚Äôt slip it so seamlessly into the daily practice. What a great idea.

For instance if you do a 15 minute mediation and want sleep sounds to play during the night, you have to go back in your phone after meditation to choose the sleep sound and manually start it. It seems counter productive to me to have to go back into your phone after a sleep meditation to play sleep sounds. If this app would allow users to put things in a queue to play more than one meditation without having to break the practice or to play a sleep sound after meditation without breaking practice by allowing users to use a queue, it would be perfect.

Jeff Warren‚Äôs content keeps me around. It‚Äôs because of his 30 day course that I‚Äôve finally established a meditation practice after years of sincere attempts.

I‚Äôm able to ease into the session, instead of being urged into quietness then being lectured by Tamara..maybe that works for other people but it‚Äôs inaccessible to me. 

I also use the children‚Äôs meditations with my five year old daughter and the sleep stories when she‚Äôs having a hard time sleeping. I‚Äôm glad to share this experience and skill with her. I was fortunate to have an elementary school teacher show me how powerful meditation and journaling was at an early age, but didn‚Äôt have a way to reintroduce it into my adult life AND share it with my daughter till now.

They keep me grounded and in the moment.  Instead of letting fear or anxiety take over and drive my thoughts, the narrator is in the driver‚Äôs seat, and they are so calming.

The only reason I gave four stars was because I really think there should be an option to make a playlist or a repeat option of what stories, sounds, etc that you want to listen to. It‚Äôs really annoying for me to have to restart a story or choose a new one because I haven‚Äôt fallen asleep yet. That really wakes me up and stresses me out.

One skill I am currently working on learning is progressive muscle relaxation. I have found the Deep Sleep Relax exercise to be very helpful at bedtime, and it would be so wonderful to have a similar exercise for day use, on the days when my anxiety can be difficult to manage. 

I do not exaggerate when I say this app saved my life. There was a time when my trauma was so overpowering it threatened my safety.

winsReview,3,2020-10-16 17:47:41,Maybe it‚Äôs just not for me,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs helpful to other people, but based solely as a meditation app this is the most cumbersome app I‚Äôve ever used. As a meditation app, what I most need is a quick way to find a session with ideal time, music, along with the amount of guidance. Calm makes browsing for this a complete nuisance.

First, there‚Äôs absolutely no way to browse or search based on time. Their Daily Calm sessions are around 10-15 minutes, but they vary by day? But if my range is around 20-30 minutes then I absolutely have to dig around different topics and collections just to see how long they are. I would have to do this every single time, which is an aggravating experience and ruins my attempt at building a daily meditation habit!

They do have a timed meditation section (sorted by time), but it‚Äôs silent with or without guidance. I just want time, music, guidance, and go.

After trying it for 3 days, I resorted to going back to a completely free app called Oak. As a sleep or music app, maybe that helps others, but the meandering stories tend to keep me awake more often than just putting on a free podcast. Hope this review is helpful to you!",False,calm,571800810,

And I sometimes need a while to fall asleep 20/30 min is not enough. A loop function or ability to build a playlist is a feature I really need in a sleep app.

 
I have another app that both allows me to turn off (or control the volume separately) background sounds and music, and to loop my story.

We need to take better care of ourselves and each other and it truly begins with some personal mindful meditation or calm moments, other than just plain bravery in the midst of so much chaos. 

My favorite thing on this app is also the most simplest - the breathing exercise. Just in and out, with two simple relaxing chords and a simple expanding circle visual. But there‚Äôs so much more, and many meditations to choose from. I also enjoy the music without lyrics, and I‚Äôd like to see more of those. 

I think the only thing I take issue with is that my choices of meditations with voices are cut in half because I prefer femme/female higher voices than deeper male voices because of certain personal triggers. Other than that, this app is very helpful and there are still a lot of choices.

I absolutely love Calm and as a therapist I recommend it to all my patients, friends, and family. Mediation is something I feel that I look forward and enjoy now. I have replaced some unhealthy coping habits with mediation and I will be forever grateful! 

Thank you Calm! Some of my favorite meditation guides on Calm are Tamara Levitt, Jeff Warren (is love to see more stuff from him in the future), and Tara Bach.  Thank you all! I feel connected and comforted by your voices of wisdom and guidance.

1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings. Also, ever meditation has a huge picture which seems ok for people new to the app, but unnecessary for whose who just want to find what they're looking for. These things can easily be fixed and I hope they do something about it. 

2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt.

One day I was on a road trip and I remember having a anxiety attack about something I just simply taped on a meditation and it worked so well I‚Äôm so soososososoosos happy I downloaded calm.

I get done with the questions, and open it up, before I look at ANY of the stories, it asked me to get a subscription..... and I thought that subscriptions were optional (that‚Äôs were I was wrong), I started looking at all the stories and I see that EVERY SINGLE ONE is locked until you subscribe. Not a single story is free.

However, I‚Äôm very displeased with all the name dropping of famous people. Today‚Äôs meditation quoted Taylor Swift and a few before quoted LeBron James. This seems very commercial and unnecessary. I use this app to help get away from the world and find myself being extremely irritated by the included quotes, which I can only assume are included merely because they are famous and perhaps giving money to the company. If I wanted nuggets of wisdom from famous people I would follow them on Instagram or Twitter. In my opinion, this app is just becoming another platform for rich and influential people.

Almost 90% of this App is a pay wall and little to no free options but, to add to that the free options are high grade quality -In my opinion-.

Yes there's a 7 day free trial but how annoying I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so ungreaful yall but people are in so much pain!! I myself almost lost my leg a month ago and I'm in excruciating pain!

It has bells, nature sounds, music, stories, pretty backgrounds, it looks nice and it‚Äôs quite polished for an app. And yes, it has a good meditation collection as well as new daily ones. 

Some suggestions for future updates:

More nature sounds and higher resolution backgrounds.  Casting this app on tv would be great too. And I definitely would not complain if you would add binaural sounds option for those of us with headphones.

TheGreatEscapeArtist,1,2021-06-29 13:08:55,Limited functionality for sleep,"The sleep story I tried was effective for helping me fall asleep, however these are only about 30 minutes long.  I woke up several times during the night and restarted the story, which worked, but if the story was longer, or if it could have been configured to repeat, it would be much less disruptive and possibly I may not have actually had to fully wake up.  

Another missing option is to have one of the ambient tracks, or anything, play automatically after the story.

The interface is not good for sleepers.  Controls should be large, obvious and omnipresent.  Mucking around with controls is disruptive for sleep and for those of us who do not sleep with our glasses on, (read everybody) very frustrating.

The subscription model for this is very expensive.  The idea that new stories and content is an important aspect for sleep is flawed.  Good content does not need to be replaced as familiarity only helps with falling asleep.

I ‚ù§ dork diaries,5,2021-04-11 04:38:34,Life-changing,"I‚Äôve never written a single app review before but this one has helped me so much that I thought it only right to share my experience. About a year and a half ago I started going to a therapist for depression, anxiety, and general mental health issues. In that very first meeting with her she told me to take a proactive approach and a good way to do that is to try this app. She recommended buying the premium version and I did and honestly that was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made regarding my mental health. Now, I‚Äôm not going to sit here and say that my mental health issues are gone or that this app was a miracle cure. In fact, that‚Äôs far from the truth but I will say I use this app every single day and they‚Äôre constantly updating the content on there so that there‚Äôs something for pretty much anyone. The user interface is incredibly easy to use and you can always find whatever you‚Äôre looking for and they have a ton of options so you can try whatever looks cool. Meditation doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and that‚Äôs important to keep in mind before investing. However, if you think this app will even help you a little bit and you have 10 minutes every day to spare then I promise you won‚Äôt regret it. 
If you‚Äôve gotten this far into the review and you‚Äôve liked what I‚Äôve had to say so far then I might as well share my routine. I try to do the ‚Äúdaily calm‚Äù everyday which is always a 10 minute guided meditation and it‚Äôs different everyday. There are also so many short meditations to chose from and some of them can be for specific emotions or situations which can also be really helpful. Having an anxiety disorder (or really a disorder of any kind) makes it incredibly difficult to think in present time and focus on the present moment, but the meditations on here have made that less of an obstacle. The thing about meditation is that it grounds you while you‚Äôre doing it, but it also trains your brain to stay grounded in your daily life as well and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so often used to treat mental health issues and that‚Äôs why it works. 
I also use the app when I go to bed because they have sleep stories, meditations for bedtime, music, and white noise sounds that will play until you tell the app to stop. The section on sleep is probably my favorite part of the app because getting a healthy amount of sleep used to be a huge issue of mine and now my sleep schedule has gotten so much better.

Not because I‚Äôm worried or anxious or anything but my mind races with thoughts. I like to read for a while at night because I heard it was relaxing but when I put it down to fall asleep but I can‚Äôt because I get caught up in the story. I‚Äôm not saying no one should read at night. I just have a lot of trouble falling asleep. My mom got this app. (I don‚Äôt really know why because I‚Äôm not a lot of trouble but on the other hand my brother really is.) And I kept seeing ads for it so when this pandemic started I just tried it. The pandemic really got me off schedule. When we were still in school waking up at 6:45 AM was easy cause I was able to fall asleep at 9:00 PM but now during the pandemic we were able to wake up at 9:00 AM and I wouldn‚Äôt fall asleep till really late. Anyway enough about me more about the app. Your probably thinking this review is trash but just wait I‚Äôm gonna talk about the app. So the app is amazing even without the premium subscription. I started a while ago so you can take my word for it. I loved this app the second I started it but day after day I used it and grew to love it so much. My very first one was taking breaths and focusing and your breathing and just your breathing. I was trying to fall asleep that night but couldn‚Äôt but after I did that right when my head hit the pillow I was asleep. This is the best calming meditation app you could own.

GarageFit13,5,2020-08-03 17:14:51,Part of my daily routine.,"Let me begin by saying I wasn‚Äôt always open to meditation. I am a meat and potato eating red-blooded American who lives in a small logging town. I work as a professional firefighter in a larger city about an hour from where I live. We workout, eat healthy, get annual physicals and do all kinds of things for our body‚Äôs health. How much do you do for your mind? The calm app is now part of my daily routine to help keep things running well between the ears. 
     I especially like the Calm app for its variety of teachers. This app is great for the practice of meditation and it has the benefits of sleep stories and sounds as well as other features. I found the ‚ÄúHow to Meditate‚Äù series by Jeff Warren very helpful in learning this new skill. Even if you aren‚Äôt a true beginner there are benefits to following his curriculum in learning how to take better advantage of other courses you do. 
     If you‚Äôre interested in mediation theory there are other apps that may be more interesting for you. Being able to take guidance from multiple teachers (which some other apps do not do) is an aspect I enjoy. 
     Try the free trial on all of the major mediation apps and decide for yourself. I‚Äôm happy I did. They all have a little bit different way of introducing you to guided meditation and they all helped me become more mindful. However, Calm is the app I chose to continue with, and an confident in recommending it to my friends and family. This is not to say the other apps don‚Äôt work or aren‚Äôt good platforms. I encourage you to find one you like and stick with it for a few months. 
     My only critique for the app is that I‚Äôd enjoy a section that explains the science behind what we‚Äôre practicing and how it benefits us. I‚Äôd like to see this section have both shorter lessons about what we‚Äôre actually doing and what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish, as well as longer discussions between experts similar to a podcast. It‚Äôd be cool if it were more interactive where I could share mediations with other people who have the app, similar to sending a pin on Pinterest or sharing a photo with my wife in the DM of Instagram.",False,calm,571800810,

Imagineer0988,5,2021-01-13 00:15:33,Calm has changed my life üòå,"I won‚Äôt make this too dramatic. I live a good life and am generally a happy person, and still I always felt like I was carrying so much stress (and honestly for no reason better than anyone else). Despite my attempts to lower stress through exercise, a healthy diet, and time outdoors, I always found those techniques to be short-term solutions (I still do all the above in tandem with Calm by the way). I finally tried Calm after hearing and reading such positive reviews. Calm has not only met but exceeded my expectations. It definitely takes a personal commitment, but carving out even just 10 minutes for the Daily Calm has completely altered my mindset in just a few weeks. In few instances do I now use the word ‚Äústressful‚Äù to describe my day. Taking stock of my daily feelings and thoughts through a quick 1-minute reflection is enough for me to get in touch with what I‚Äôm most anxious about or grateful for. And then the meditations themselves are enjoyable, plentiful and highly effective! The quality is exceptional as well. I absolutely love the narrators, the categories (including bedtime stories, soundscapes, music, and traditional meditations), and the overall peace of mind that comes with this wonderful program. $70/year is so worth the price! Of course Calm is just the tool. You‚Äôre the one who will have to come to the table with an open mind and a ready heart willing to do the work, but doing so will yield tremendous value! The world will be a better place if everyone took 10 minutes for the Daily Calm.

I felt lost and alone. My mental health took a downward spiral during covid and recently even worse due to the holidays. I suffered a lot of abuse and trauma at the hands of my parents so the holidays are particularly hard for me. Anyways, I landed myself in the ER twice surrounding thanksgiving and felt 100% out of control... it was the worst I‚Äôve been mentally in a really long time. I‚Äôve had the calm app downloaded on my phone for years, but never purchased the premium... until recently when I experience a panic attack so horrible, I was convinced my heart would stop beating any moment. I immediately purchased the premium and used the SOS meditation. Since then, I‚Äôve been meditating every night. I can‚Äôt begin to tell you what this has done for me... I lost myself in 2020 when I lost everything else. My fianc√© and I canceled our wedding. Lost thousands of dollars. Lost our jobs. Fianc√© had to get an emergency hysterectomy. It was a horrible year. But calm is helping me end this year with some control in my hands. I‚Äôm not fully there yet but I‚Äôm already feeling like I have more of a grasp on controlling my body. I‚Äôm so thankful to the creators of this app and I‚Äôm thankful that you‚Äôve made it so affordable (in comparison to other mental health apps that profit a lot on that community). I know it‚Äôs not 10 dollars cheap, but it‚Äôs worth it... even if you can‚Äôt afford the annual membership, at least get the monthly one and give yourself the chance to breath.

miss flack <3,5,2020-12-28 04:24:55,Like therapy in my pocket!,"I have suffered from severe panic disorder, GAD, depression, and OCD since age 12 (I am 30 now). I have been in therapy since then, but I am only able to afford it on a biweekly basis, when in reality I need support weekly if not more. My therapist recommended this app to me while in the midst of a relapse last year, and I downloaded it figuring if I didn‚Äôt like it I could just cancel after the free trial. I didn‚Äôt expect much.

This app is a literal GODSEND for people struggling with mental illness. The 7 Days of Calming Anxiety and 21 Days of Calm have been lifesaving programs for me. I repeat them as needed and they are a great supplement to my regular therapy sessions! I feel immediately so relaxed after practicing them, even if I was in the midst of a 5 alarm panic attack right before that. At night and on weekends when I don‚Äôt have access to a mental health professional, or in between sessions, this is a lifesaver. It‚Äôs like having therapy in your pocket. Not only is Tamara‚Äôs voice incredibly soothing, but she takes the time to actually explain anxiety and how it works, which makes me feel less alone or less silly and reassured me when I‚Äôm feeling crazy bodily symptoms. 

For people saying that it‚Äôs expensive: I understand 80 dollars a year is not something all of us have, especially in times like these, but when you really think about the cost of therapy per year, this is a much more affordable and helpful option in a pinch.

michaelspringfield,4,2020-07-05 17:38:28,Fantastic app but lacking in one key area,"I love this app. I wear IEMs (In Ear Monitors) when I sleep to help me relax and stay asleep. I tried Luther apps but never found one that fit my needs. Either the guided meditation was lacking or the sound quality of the music/nature sounds was horrible. I found Calm and everything was great. I did the 7 day free trial and loved it. The $69/year subscription price is a bit of a sticker shock. (Everything is a subscription today and if you aren‚Äôt careful you can subscribe yourself into bankruptcy.) Fortunately they offered a discount that was low enough that I decided to give it a shot for a year. I have be using it pretty much daily for almost two months. There‚Äôs a guided meditation for just about any need. There‚Äôs high quality music and nature sounds are high quality and sound fantastic through my expensive IEMs. The sleep stories are a great feature. I feel like I am getting better sleep. All around the best app of it‚Äôs kind. 

Now to where it falls short. There‚Äôs no way to customize your user experience. It‚Äôs Calm‚Äôs way or no way. Yes their way is great and works well most of the time. They have playlist but there‚Äôs no way to customize them to meet my individual needs. This was a dealbreaker for me at $69/year so I‚Äôm not sure I will renew when my annual subscription is up. What would make this the perfect app would be to customize my sleep experience. I want to be able to create a custom playlist (or multiple custom playlist) to last throughout the night. Yes, I know that many of the music tracks are an hour long and you can set a sleep time that will repeat the track for hours but you are still repeating one track. I want the ability to start with a sleep story then have it play music the rest of the night. Maybe I want one track that will help me fall asleep, another track or 2 that will help me stay asleep and a track that is a little more upbeat to help me wake up refreshed. That should be something included in a subscription of this price. 

One final ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù would be profiles. The annual subscription price would be much easier to swallow if I could have a separate profile for myself, my wife and my kids each with our own playlist.",False,calm,571800810,

Sense&Sensibikity,5,2020-10-27 17:36:58,"Real, logical and compassion help, right here","Im a PhD with three Ivy league degrees, one in philosophy‚Äîthe stark Anglo-American genre which seemed to give no credence to anything not provable in the logical positive sense. I‚Äôm also a Skeptic by nature. Therefore, when many I am close to encouraged me to try mindful-fulness, although I witnessed changes for the better it brought about in their outlooks and real time personal and professional success, i just did not think it would speak to me. Reaching baby boomer age, I also viewed this as in the sphere of millennials. When I wanted to reduce my stress, I‚Äôd usually run, or jog;  play squash, or virtual tennis. I am a strong woman, an ethical and moral hard-worker for deserving causes, but have been historically hard on my self (and those close to me) for what I gauge as my shortcomings.
Calm has taught me physical and mental methods that have allowed me, over the past two years of listening to selections as they speak to my inner hopes and struggles, and the heartbreaks occurring in the greater world and personal sphere, which include a family death from Covid-19‚Äîhow to go through and to an extend get past grief, how to stop panic when it starts, how to use focus on breathe tp calm like musical meter.

Calm, Tamara‚Äôs education insights and the practices she walks through with us, are humanism as much as spirituality. Strange and mystical thoughts are not propounded. She gets you in touch with your heartbeat, the exhale, the tense shoulders, which in relaxing, next push clutter and disturbances from the mind, putting worry in perspective.  from the mind.

Shaktigoddess,3,2020-09-01 13:57:30,To Go To App To Chill,"I really enjoy all the different portions of this app. The sleep stories for the most part are really good, especially the travel ones. There are some that are a bit too much meant for a child and others like Harry Styles that are too romance novel type. He‚Äôs great as far as a VO but the writing is too much like a fantasy going to sleep with him. A little too personal. 
The section with inspirational people are awesome like Lebron James or the interview type with different people is great for a new perspective. The one on the 30 day meditation was nicely done.
The daily calm segments need improvement. It‚Äôs starts and ends with the same instructions and always with the same VO. Please have options of a different talent. She sounds contrived and needs to switch it up so there‚Äôs more of a message and not the same words. If there could be a choice to try a different person besides Tamara it would be better. She comes across as insincere or she‚Äôs getting distracted by the sound of her own voice in the headphones. I find it hard to get though it and have. Any times just avoided this part altogether because I don‚Äôt like the snarky tone of her delivery. The segment is too short to end it with ‚Äò come back to the room, wiggle your toes‚Äô phrasing. That‚Äôs something you might say after a long yoga session. It‚Äôs a quick message. Perhaps not wearing headphones might help her to not force a voice tone or change her speaking into a natural speaking voice. 
The ambiance water sounds after the segments are a nice touch. A great way to fade out of them. Leaving them on longer would be appreciated like a relaxing white noise.

KaavHTX,3,2020-09-18 06:32:03,needs to include diverse experiences,"I‚Äôm a POC who loves using Calm for sleep and anxiety. Recently, I‚Äôve been hosting meditation sessions using Calm for a group of people everyday - the variety of topics covered is awesome!

How Calm could do better: it seems clear from the content of the meditations that there is a certain type of person that is expected to be listening to these - someone who is completely able bodied, and has a generally comfortable life, but does face stress over day to day happenings. The language used in meditations can be isolating to those who do not have those experiences. (for example, the meditation in gratitude for your body often talked of feeling gratified that you could see - because some people can‚Äôt. Why is there an assumption here that blind people don‚Äôt meditate?)

Further, there are topics that people of color or those in the lgbtq+ community grapple with that seem glaringly missing. For example, how do you use mindfulness deal with anger or trauma from the stress of violence or micro aggression? How do you use meditation have pride in who you are, if you are different from others? How do you grapple with wanting to make a difference in the world but knowing you can‚Äôt change everything? If you are white, how do you navigate guilt or shame and then these feelings into action? How can you feel gratitude when you are going through a major illness? These are all big questions, many of which are a part of my life, but it feels like the assumed listener of Calm only worries about day to day work and basic relational questions, as those are usually the examples provided. I believe meditation can be transformational in navigating the emotional complexity of these experiences, and not just a tempory/trivial feel-good activity, but I think work has to be put in if Calm can actually lead that transformation.",False,calm,571800810,

This was made specifically for sleeping and knowing the majority of people use their phones as an alarm clock, it would only make sense to have this as an option. But with the way the app is now, if you turn the volume down so the app isn‚Äôt blasting a narration or sleep sounds at full volume, you‚Äôre ALSO turning the volume of your alarm clock down. After taking the risk and turning the volume down and missing my alarm a few times, I learned my lesson and had to stop using the app at night. So it became useless to me until I went out and bought an actual alarm clock so I could start using the app again.

The other thing that is frustrating is that the timer doesn‚Äôt work for the music. I have a hard time staying asleep so I like to have the sleep music playing all night long to keep me in that trance-like state. But whenever I try to use the timer to keep it playing for 8+ hours, it never registers and the music stops playing after the 30 minutes. Every. Single. Time.

Normally I wouldn‚Äôt care this much and just move on and not take the time to write a review. But since I had to spend $70 on the app plus $25 on an alarm clock, I‚Äôm just a litttttttttttttle annoyed. Just a lil (a lot). Anyway, that‚Äôs all. Now time to try to sleep and stopped getting stressed about an app called CALM. Oh, the irony.",False,calm,571800810,

shannen1884,2,2020-10-20 12:29:29,Miss the old Calm,"I‚Äôve had this app for years and used to love it. Unfortunately, I now find myself about to delete it and wanted to share some feedback from a now former user before I did. 

When I first got Calm, it had a handful of features unlocked. A few stories, several music/soundscape options. They were great. The premium options were tempting. I was considering buying the premium service though it was hard to justify it considering the plethora of other services available out there. Was Calm better than alternatives? Arguably, yes. Is it that much better to justify the high cost of admission? That was something I was on the fence about. I was willing to give it more time and see. In the meantime, I sung its praises it to a room full of women during a discussion on self-care, meditation, and stress management. I was a fan.  

Now, however, I find that everything on the app is now locked down and only available with the Premium subscription. I no longer have any options left making it worth the storage space on my phone. Where once the Premium subscription was tempting, it is now just off-putting. Apps that have no usability without subscription are immediately deleted on my phone. I gave Calm a little more time out of loyalty for a product I once loved. I‚Äôm not angry. I‚Äôm not trying to say that you shouldn‚Äôt have a premium service option. I just wish you still had some usability available like you used to. While you are good, there are other options out there for me that won‚Äôt cost me $$ every year. I wish you the very best and am sad to be parting ways, but I just can‚Äôt justify spending that kind of cash every single year. Thanks for the memories.",False,calm,571800810,

1adlee,5,2020-12-13 21:33:28,5 star app but ...,"I love calm enough to buy the lifetime membership.  The offerings  and selections in various categories are such that one could never be bored.  This app is a true service to those who are in need for mindfulness to quite the mind, soothe the soul, sort out one‚Äôs emotions and bring some much needed sleep with its library of sleep stories that are so captivating, I often wish I could stay awake to hear the end but that would defeat the point of the sleep story. 

My only concern is that once in a while, not often enough to be a problem, the app ‚Äúforgets‚Äù I have a lifetime membership and entreats me to sign up as if I have no subscription.  I was taken to a page to do a free 7 day trial and nowhere on this page was there an opportunity to choose to sign in or reset my password. 

I‚Äôm not sure why the app drops my membership or subscription status but it would be less troublesome if the option to login and/or reset my password was also offered with the ‚Äúsubscribe ‚Äú offer.  My best guess as to why this happens is the app is triggered by the time of year I would subscribe if I had an annual plan which I had before switching to lifetime membership but still would like to see password reset and login options. This would make sense because my email address is retained in accounts page. 

This though is a minor issue,  so still a 5 star app for me because it is well thought out in organization and abundant in both quality content and options.

collkid 696969,5,2021-04-06 22:09:17,"AMAZING App, no difficulties","I love the app daily calm. There are so many amazing things about it, but here is a summarization:
Before I got this app, I seriously had sleeping problems. Like, it would take me and hour to fall asleep! So, I got this app, and it seriously helps me out with stuff, like I started listening to some of the sleep stories on here, and I fall asleep before the story ends every. Single. Time!!! There‚Äôs even a ‚Äúback to sleep‚Äù thing that helps you fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night randomly. (Which I find myself doing quite often)
Secondly, I also have some major anger problems. Like, I will scream over the littlest things. Sometimes, doing the breathing exercises in the app really helps me out with that and doing some of the meditation stuff on here helps with that as well. Also, I have the subscription on this app, which is TOTALLY worth it. It gives you access to more things I‚Äôm pretty sure, and it‚Äôs not way too much to handle. But then of course, I don‚Äôt know what the app is like without the subscription so if you don‚Äôt get the subscription I don‚Äôt know what to promise you. All I know is that with the subscription you get access to all of the different meditations, sleep stories, breathing exercises, etc... for 0$, as in completely free. So if you get the subscription, there‚Äôs that. 
Also, this isn‚Äôt one of those apps where it makes you rate the app right as you get it. Seriously, all these 5 star ratings are because it actually works. Also, if you are trying to go to sleep on this app at night, I recommend putting your phone on night mode and turning the darkness all the way down. (Because screens affect your sleep)
Overall, I highly highly recommend this app, and really hope that you end up getting it. ( especially if you are trying to solve sleep problems or just needing to relax )

GrandmaCap,2,2020-03-15 03:37:58,Be aware!  unintentional automatic subscription!,"My rating is not to do with the quality of the app.  ( I would give it at least 4 stars) I do however feel I was tricked into being charged a full price yearlong subscription. I downloaded the app from the App Store.  I was looking for an app to help me calm down and help with my sleep.  I will say, this app is exactly what I would have subscribed too on purpose after using my free 2 week trial.  At firstI thoughtI could look at the app quickly before starting my free trial.  That is not how it works.  By opening it,I started me free trial.  Moreover, by starting that free trial,  I did not realize that unless I turned off auto renewal, I would automatically charge my itunes associated credit card for a full price($69) full year subscription.  Unknowing, after it seemed like twoweeksfreetrial should be over, I wondered why I was still able to open the app. I HAD recieved from them an offerto buy the app at $49( or maybe it was closer to $45), but I did not accept that offer, still unaware that I was about to be charged full price for app instead!   I asked questions online and also looked at the contents of app and finally found my account info.  That is how I discovered that I was charged for full price, full year subscription!  I see that one can also just join for a month at a time.  That is what I would have chosen to do as a subscriber, but I was not given that choice.  My choices were hidden in the app in my account info.  I believe that is a deceptive practice.  When I tried to get help, my only choice to communicate was not fruitful.  All I got in response was an automated answer that said I had no recourse, nor any live person to talk too.

So basically I am saying, if you download the app from itunes app store, you are starting your two week free trial. And most importantly, you are committing toroll that over intoa full priced yearlong subscription after that.  If i had not changed my Calm settings AND if I do not check the charges monthly on that credit card, I could havebeen paying yearly automatically the rest of my life!  Calm of course does not take responsiblity for their app if you downloaded it from App Store.  I honestly didnt know there was any other way to download it.

xstitchnan,5,2020-09-19 06:33:10,Life changing app!,"I‚Äôve been using this app daily for about 2 years and it is life changing!  Every few months I find something else to love about it. 

I‚Äôve struggled with lifelong insomnia, ADHD brain that won‚Äôt let me sleep, being a light sleeper, and then most recently with anxiety after the loss of a family member. 

I started using it because of the sleep stories. I still use them 2-4 times a week.  They are just interesting enough to get me to pay attention but there is no climax to the story, so you eventually drift off. While my favorite narrator is Tamara Levitt, I also enjoy Stephen Fry and most anyone with an accent.  For a little fun, the teacher from Ferris Bueller reads an incredibly dry textbook. Once the story is finished (usually 15-30 minutes), it can transition to the Scene of your choice or simply shut off. I prefer to transition to a scene as I‚Äôve always needed background noise to sleep. I rarely notice as I‚Äôm usually asleep by the end of the sleep story. 

Every single night, I use one of the sleep scenes. The sunset ocean is my favorite. Sometimes I even watch it to help my brain slow down, but I listen to it all night every single night. 

For the last few months, I‚Äôve been enjoying the music as I wind down for the night. Since I started working from home during Covid19, I‚Äôve started listening to the music for work. I‚Äôve found that with my ADHD, it really helps my mind focus on the task at hand. 

There are so many other features that I‚Äôve barely sampled like guided meditations and ASMR, but I‚Äôm thrilled with this app as is. 

If I had ONE suggestion to make, it‚Äôs that the developers add the Train Ride from Soundscapes to the Scenes. Listening to a train story with it fading to the sounds of a train ride for the rest of the night would be amazing!

This has truly been a life changing app, and I would like to take the time to thank the developers, musicians and narrators for helping me so significantly for the last couple of years. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever thanked an app developer before, but then I‚Äôve never used such an amazing app!!!",False,calm,571800810,

Frost Rainwatter,5,2020-02-06 04:57:01,Holy macrarony! If you want a frickin app to fall asleep to THEN BUY THIS INE!,"As I already said, BUY THIS APP IF YOU NEED HELP SLEEPING! I had to personally go through at least four apps to be able to find one that always has stories to like listen to. I‚Äôm young and in middle school and have a few problems sleeping but it also gives me SO many ideas for my book I‚Äôm writing. I also zone out a few times because if I do you can her the person talking behind your thoughts and if your thoughts become negative, then just bring your mind back to this app. It is worth paying for! If I could give this app one hundred stars then so be it! 
One thing I wish they had was like E-books like a section for online books that you can go to when bored and read your self, with the narrator, or just listen to it. Also this idea would be good for trips like road trips or if your on a long plane flight. If they also had pod-casts or little factual stories that actually talks bout something like science or an animal, would also be cool.
BTW these ideas does not meant this app is any bad at all. It‚Äôs just a few ideas that could help improve things and help people feel better or have more uses of this app. By the way the stories are usually 20-40 minutes and the shorted is probally 11 minites. There is also a thing we‚Äôre you can like record your felling and like I enter like diary enters bout my feeling into the feeling thing and you can go back and see what yo felt three nights ago or a year ago. Pretty cool and so worth any money. ( not sure if this one was actually money or the other one that I tried and the other one sucked the stories were depressing from the other app this app is great)
All in all get it it‚Äôs worth it love it. GOD JOB CALM LOVE IT!

elocin2003,4,2020-01-30 19:16:29,Worth it but needs improvement,"I love this app. I loved the free version when I first downloaded it about two years ago and I haven‚Äôt been disappointed since purchasing a subscription more than a ago. I especially love the sleep stories. However it does need a couple of minor improvements.

1) I like the idea of the daily calm. I commend Tamara Levitt for compiling them for us. I just don‚Äôt like they way they‚Äôre laid out. Since each one is typically 10-11 minutes, I would like to focus on the subject that she is presenting during more of those 10-11 minutes. Each one is organized like so: 3-4 minutes of breathing discussion and/or body scan, 3-4 minutes of complete silence, 2-3 minutes of the subject matter that it is in the title, immediately followed by an ending to the meditation. The problem I have is that sometimes the only time I have to meditate is before bed. With the daily calm being set up this way, I fall asleep during the silent part before gaining the benefit of the information in the daily calm, then wake up annoyed later. If instead on the rare occasion I‚Äôm able to meditate earlier in the day, I often find myself literally fast forwarding to the 7+ minute mark to quickly listen to what‚Äôs being said, then try to make mental note of it to meditate on it later. I think less time should be spent on breathing and body scanning in the beginning, with only a very short break before going into the subject matter of the meditation so that more time can be spent on the meditation subject and then have the silent stretch before the ending comments. 

2) I love listening to the music options while I‚Äôm at work. I noticed some time ago that the music selections don‚Äôt have a repeat option. That‚Äôs fine for the ones that are an hour or more long, but for the shorter pieces that are only 10 minutes, it‚Äôs a little silly that I have to keep going back to the app to restart it while I‚Äôm working. But I haven‚Äôt looked into it lately so that might have changed already. 

3) I‚Äôm having issues with loading the scenes that have dark/light mode options. I like both the night time and day time versions of Jasper Lake in particular (whose dark and light mode options come with very different sounds) and I would like to be able to choose which one I‚Äôm listening to regardless of time of day and regardless of dark/light mode. I keep my phone and iPad in dark mode because it‚Äôs easier on my eyes but to get the version of Jasper Lake that I want, I have to switch modes and open and close the app several times before I get the one I want. 

Other than that it‚Äôs great. I was able to get a year‚Äôs subscription during a sale event. If those things aren‚Äôt fixed I might not be willing to pay full price next year. I guess it depends on how addicting those sleep stories get between now and then. üòÅ",True,calm,571800810,"{'id': 6598106, 'body': 'Hi elocin2003, thanks for your thorough and honest review. For 1, we recently added a Sleep Timer to music, so I\'ll see if we can do something similar for the Breathe Bubble. For 2, I passed your feedback along.

akirie,5,2020-10-02 15:15:12,Life changing,"I‚Äôve been using Calm for three weeks now. I can say with utmost sincerity that this app has changed my life. With everything going on, including the panic inducing CA wildfires in my back yard, I finally reached a breaking point. I‚Äôve had multiple panic attacks in the last 6 months that cripple me for days. Depression symptoms were persistent. I was to the point where I called the National Suicide Hotline. Everything felt overwhelming and out of control. I felt there was no way forward. 

This is no more. 

I contacted a therapist via my HMO, Kaiser. She told me I could get the app for free for a year through my insurance. I assumed it would just be basic, with a handful of disappointing guided meditations. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. 

I am now on day 18 of the How To Meditate series. I am learning every day how to strengthen my mind in the face of adversity and the unknown. I can‚Äôt recall anytime in my life that I have felt so grounded and in control of my emotions. The previously impossible now feels possible. I have hope. I feel like an unshakable mountain when faced with adversity. 

And this is in less than three weeks. 

I am so passionate about the power of meditation that I now want to teach it to everyone. Meditation is the pathway to sanity. And this app gives you more than enough tools to make it a part of your daily life. The instructors, the variety, the music! Honestly, I live in this app now.

KatieColihan,5,2020-07-30 12:46:58,Meditating isn‚Äôt for people like me - the sad ones.,"I‚Äôve heard about meditation for years, and whenever I‚Äôd Google it, there were always images of smiling, happy, fit people - sitting in their perfect homes with gorgeous views of lakes, or on the beach in a bikini with a huge smile.  

Totally not me. I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not miserable (but not smiling all the time), my house is fine, but no lake view. The last time I was at my goal weight was when I was a newborn. I assumed you had to go into meditation happy and healthy already so I checked that off of my list along with ‚ÄúHotel Receptionist‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdvanced Yoga‚Äù. 

But out of sheer desperation, after a scary plunge back into a depressive state, I was desperate to try anything. I wanted my brain to turn the heck off. So after scrolling Instagram for images of more people doing life right, I saw a trusted friend of mine mention Calm and decided to try it. 

I sat down on my floor beside a box of ice cream cake that I had just eaten, turned off my ‚ÄúHeartbreak‚Äù playlist, threw in some ear buds, and did a guided meditation. 

Long story long, I‚Äôve had Calm as an app for coming up on 2 years. I‚Äôve had about 135 days that I‚Äôve done meditation. It‚Äôs a skill that needs to be learned, it won‚Äôt click overnight, but there‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äúbad‚Äù session. I love having the ability now to take a ‚ÄúBrain Time our‚Äù when my mind is racing. I‚Äôve noticed my anxiety levels drop. Depression still happens for me, but Calm is one of the sharpest tools in my Mental First Aid kit. 

If you‚Äôre a newbie or on the fence about meditation, I‚Äôd say to give it a whirl for a few weeks. Be satisfied and okay if you legit just sit with your eyes closed during that time and listen to Tamara (the voice behind Calm, which is, by far, the best voice I‚Äôve heard in Meditation apps).",False,calm,571800810,

SandruhDee,4,2020-03-23 13:47:48,Tamara Levitt - No thanks,"If she is the true author of many of these meditations & stories, she is brilliant. BUT I really wish there would be more options for readers to read her work instead of her reading it herself because unfortunately many of the people I know, myself included, cannot stand listening to the way she reads. It‚Äôs her voice, it‚Äôs the way she forces every word to have vocal fry. It‚Äôs the way she adds so much inappropriate emotion where it doesn‚Äôt belong. It‚Äôs strong enough to where you cannot focus and relax. She is not relaxing at all. It seems more like she‚Äôs intentionally trying to evoke reactions and is way out of place for meditation and sleep stories. Literally cannot stand it and so we‚Äôre missing out on so many of the options. For premium you‚Äôd think they could offer the option to swap readers for a lot more of them than you can. 

Edit- just to add more about how incredibly annoying Tamara Levitts voice is. I literally cannot stand to listen to her and when I accidentally click on something she does or since you have to open some of them up to figure out who‚Äôs reading one you have to actually start them and then have to listen for a second...and every time it‚Äôs her I actually cringe. She makes so many people uncomfortable the way she speaks I don‚Äôt know how they haven‚Äôt pulled her from being a reader. It really makes a huge portion of this app unusable. It‚Äôs unfortunate. Pleaseeeeeeeee Tamara, use your skills in another way for the app than being the voice behind any of it. Pleaseeee Calm, encourage her to think about having someone else read her material!

Edit some time later - seems like the app is always adding a more varied group of readers which is great üëç A suggestion would be to have the one male reader that‚Äôs behind much of the core material to also be used for at least some body scans. As of now all the body scans are Tamara...would be nice to have that option from a different reader too as this is some of the more used material and as you read above for many she is not an actual option to listen to. Another suggestion...would be really nice for info to be shown on the outside of a tab so you don‚Äôt have go open it up and then go into each entry to see A) if it is just one or maybe several readings B) what readers are available C) the length of the entries. 

Also just want to say that my intentions aren‚Äôt to be offensive regarding Tamara‚Äôs voice. I know I‚Äôve gone on and on about it, but it really is a big deal. Meditation is supposed to allow you to relax and it‚Äôs bothersome that huge chunks of this expensive app are actually unusable. I would be able to swallow it a bit better if I thought it was just my own personal thing I had about it, but knowing that so many feel the same way it‚Äôs frustrating they don‚Äôt work harder to make it better for everyone. They have to know. So that leaves me wondering if it comes down to a bruised ego or not wanting someone else to take/share her projects - whether it‚Äôs better for the listeners or not - because I believe she‚Äôs the/one of the founders and must have plenty of say in these matters.",False,calm,571800810,

213AMM,3,2021-05-01 23:18:06,Starting a free trial? Read this for a better experience.,"Just be careful with your free trial. I wanted to see if this app would be useful for me. Turns out, I rarely used it in my 7 day trial, which is actually more like 5 days since you MUST cancel 24 hours or before the 7 days or you‚Äôll be charged $70 for the whole year, which I failed to do. Nope, you don‚Äôt automatically get charged for a $15 monthly plan, you get charged for the whole year if you fail to cancel your free trial. Lovely! But whatever, my fault. At least I can ‚Äúcancel anytime!‚Äù

Ok, well here‚Äôs my rant on the ‚Äúcancel anytime policy.‚Äù Sorry to say, but canceling anytime is a little play on words. Sure, you can indeed ‚Äúcancel anytime‚Äù like the app says. However, it‚Äôs useless. Canceling 364 days before the subscription ends, like I was in the process of doing, and canceling 1 day before the subscription ends, results in the same charge. Yep, you‚Äôre still getting charged the $70 for the year even if you cancel, like in my case, 18 hours into the year‚Äôs subscription. 

So what should you take from this? Just cancel your 7 day trial after 5 days or you‚Äôll be charged. And if you still want to use the app after the trial, I would STILL recommend canceling and then buying the monthly plan, at least to start. Because if after 1-2 months you no longer like the app, you‚Äôre stuck with paying $70. If you still like the app after a couple months, then upgrade to the yearly plan, which is cheaper then paying for 12 individual months. (You do this in Apple‚Äôs settings > tap your name at the very top > tap subscriptions > tap the ‚Äúcalm‚Äù app.

B262683,3,2021-01-10 13:59:53,"Enjoy it, but it NEEDS IN-APP VOLUME CONTROL, not affecting my entire phone volume directly","Let me start off by saying, I would give 5 stars and be completely over the moon ecstatic if it had IN APP VOLUME CONTROL. I purchased an annual subscription almost a month ago, and I have been using it daily. It‚Äôs very helpful in explaining how to mediate, guiding and teaching and the reasoning why it is so important. I mainly purchased it because I have daily struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep. I really do wish there was an option with volume control, this is a major issue for me! I have to turn the volume on my phone down, and if/ when I do fall asleep, I don‚Äôt wake up to my alarm or calls. 

Calm WOULD BE PERFECT and 100% better if there was the ability to change the volume of the voice on meditations and background sounds on the app alone, not having to change my entire phone volume! I have another sleep app that is free (with option to upgrade) with sounds to fall asleep to and it has ‚úÖa mixer, allowing me to not disrupt my phone volume, just controls the volume directly on the app. ‚úÖ I feel that there is no reason Calm should not have something like that. If I keep the volume at where my iPhone is already set to, it is extremely loud, to the point I can hear meditations or sleep sounds through earplugs! Because I mainly use this for sleep, this has been a HUGE ISSUE and I BEG THE DEVELOPERS TO IMPROVE THIS AND INCORPORATE an IN APP VOLUME CONTROL!!! Other than the volume issue, I really do enjoy Calm, but I do wish I would have done the free trial before purchasing an annual subscription. I don‚Äôt think I would have purchased, especially not an annual subscription, in retrospect. I definitely won‚Äôt renew if they don‚Äôt incorporate in app volume control.

MalPalPlayz,1,2020-01-26 06:19:29,I love it but I hate it.,"I love this app. I downloaded it almost a year ago in order to help me sleep better and that is exactly what it did. The calming background music to the simple sleep stories that I was able to listen to during my free trial made me fall in love and sleep a thousand times better.

However, I believe that the price at which we are being asked to pay is far too exclusive to a certain amount of people.

I am a high-school student graduating in May and I don‚Äôt have the money to pay for this app when all I‚Äôm trying to do is get educated and sleep good. I have stress coming from all angles and I have suffered from too many sleepless nights over the years and I just wish I could use this app a little more freely. Not full full access to 100% of commodities within the app, but a little more than we get now.  

When I first downloaded this app, I began to sleep amazingly. This was when I had full access during my free trial, but since it ended I have only been able to listen to ‚ÄúBlue Gold‚Äù by Steven Fry. 

What a fantastic piece it is, but simply making the free version a bit more fair would be nice. 

Possibly allowing ‚ÄúBlue Gold‚Äù to remain a permanent free story, but allowing other stories to circulate at random every 24 hours.

I would honestly love that. Even if I was unable to choose which sleep story to listen to, at least I would get something different everyday, y‚Äôknow?

In short I think making this app so heavily subscription based really isn‚Äôt fair to the people who are just looking for better, healthier, safer options for sleeping outside of medicine. 

The app is supposed to help people sleep better(among other aspects of life), so how can they do that if they don‚Äôt have the money to pay for it. 

This app is a straight jacket. Point blank. You either have the money and buy the subscription or you listen to ‚ÄùBlue Gold‚Äù a  hundred thousand freaking times to the point where you know the story word for word.

Know, I understand that the narrators and authors must be paid somehow, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem very fair to make this app so exclusive to only the people who can pay the already outrageous price for it.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that my review will be overshadowed by the majority of 5 star reviews because the price is not a problem for them.

BIG thanks to Calm for making a very much needed app only available to the people with the biggest wallets.",False,calm,571800810,

dcw94945,1,2020-07-03 16:42:50,In case you need more Lebron James in your life...no thanks,"7 day trial with auto charge for $70 after. Except virtually EVERYTHING on homepage is locked. With a graphic of Lebron James on it? Are you serious? So I have to look at him every time I go to meditate? Nothing objectionable about Lebron specifically‚Äîit could be Betty White, Forrest Whitaker, Bruce Springsteen or the Dalai Lama‚ÄîI just really don‚Äôt want to be greeted by a celebrity EVER when I go to meditate. Getting away from celebrity and consumer culture is one of the reasons I meditate in the first place. I‚Äôm probably going back to Andy @ Headspace. He‚Äôs WAY less ‚Äúin your face‚Äù and I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs trying to sell me the same junk I‚Äôm trying to escape from. 

Also, I was trying this app because I read that it was more suited to experienced meditators. Still can‚Äôt identify why anyone would say that. It seems very gimmicky. All I want out of a meditation app is some basic structure to help me stay on track. Not a Hollywood production. For example: How do I find a 20 minute meditation? Not 3, not 2 not 11.5. But AT LEAST 20 minutes. And I don‚Äôt need a ‚Äútheme‚Äù like a specific meditation is a prescription for some specific ailment. It‚Äôs not Advil. Can‚Äôt seem to find much ‚Äúmeditation value‚Äù in and amongst all the ‚Äúproduction value‚Äù flotsam.  

Another example: ‚ÄúTrain your mind‚Äù could be good. But either get Lebron James out of it or offer a similar series without that gimmick.  And ‚Äúrain on trees.‚Äù ‚ÄúCurated by Lebron James!?‚Äù You got an NBA personality to ‚Äúcurate‚Äù an audio loop of rain on trees? Do you know what ‚Äúcurate‚Äù means? Do you have anyone on staff who gets how cringey that is in a meditation app? If so you should listen to that person. It‚Äôs also insulting to your user‚Äôs intelligence but that‚Äôs another issue. 

And what‚Äôs with all the ‚Äú7 days‚Äù nonsense? Meditation isn‚Äôt an antibiotic regimen. This is just more ‚Äúlisticle‚Äù stuff that suggests that all problems can be solved with a grocery list. Stop reading Medium, and stop confusing meditation with ‚Äúproductivity culture.‚Äù They have almost nothing to do with one another. You need someone on staff who‚Äôs reading and helping incorporate REAL meditation technique, value and theory. 

Free marketing advice: A lot of people meditate in order to escape from and/or clear away the junk that assaults their consciousness all day every day. Don‚Äôt be part of the problem people are using your product to get away from. Simplify. Simplify. Simplify.

Pretty sure I‚Äôm going back to Headspace but I will poke around a bit more and see if I can find something worthwhile here. So far big thumbs down.",False,calm,571800810,

VeggieVeggie666,1,2020-09-26 04:06:07,"Non-existent customer support, animal rights violation","I started using calm, based on the nature based meditations and sleep stories, but it seemed like they care more about quantity than quality and the app is terribly bloated, cumbersome to use with constant crashing created by developers who have no concern for performance and usability. Worst of all, agree with other posters on TrustPilot that the company seems to have the wrong attitude especially for a wellness / meditation app. The ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù is practically non-existent, condescending and useless!! No one cares about your issue or complaint on anything. 

I reported a sleep story where elephants are made to work, taking tourists around on a safari, even though the story claims they did them a favor by not riding on them (!) but mind you, still made to work for tourists and taken away from the wild and their families and herd to be our guides!

This is just promoting exploitation of wild animals, which are already having enough issues in their struggle to survive! If not curbed, who knows they might have a animal circus story next! 

This is horrendous for a wellness app or anywhere! Inspite of reporting, they didn‚Äôt even bother to take such content down and the ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù was condescending in his tone when followed up to enquire what action has been taken!! 

Will definitely be taking this up further with animal rights organizations as they haven‚Äôt removed that content! 

These people should not be in the meditation business, which is so unlike headspace app and their culture, who model what they‚Äôre about! The whole app and set up feels much worse now with their horrible attitude! 

Most of their ‚Äústuff‚Äù isn‚Äôt good quality material and many of their narrators should not be narrators for sleep stories or meditation. This is the best example of what happens when meditation is taken over by business! This seems to create more despair than calm!",False,calm,571800810,

Jams2nd None,5,2021-05-04 05:08:16,Very pleased!,"CALM app, is a must for everyone! Kids, teens, men, women, it‚Äôs for all! 

Quick summary, early on in my marriage, I learned of my anxiety, after our first born I learned of my depression. Either of those alone aren‚Äôt easy to manage, then add the info below... Who wouldn‚Äôt need CALM in their life?

I am a mother to 7 children and wife. I never imagined having this many children, nor would I have guessed our ‚Äúfifth‚Äù pregnancy would turn out to be spontaneous triplets. 
 
The amount of changes in our life in such a small window of time, sent my struggle with Anxiety and Depression into a fast spiral of mental breakdown. After seeking professional help, my husband knew a bit of CALM at home, on the go and walking was needed for this mama! He decided (upon my request) this app was worth the investment and gifted it to me. Let me say... Seven children (triplets) on a small salary. 

I have really enjoyed the CALM app, it‚Äôs helped me in so many areas of my life. 
-My favorite part is the NEW content all.the.time! My other favorite is the meditation for beginners and pros. I have enjoyed learning how to meditate. The way husband describes it is, it‚Äôs teaching me how to go into my nothing box - like men. (YouTube: men and their nothing box.) Yes, yes, yes it does! I LOVE IT! Have you ever just wanted to silence the world or sit quietly in a crowded room and people watch!? Having no worry or care in the world about what is going on around you!? This app is so good at guiding you through your thoughts and feelings or allowing you the freedom to hear the wind in the trees, ocean sounds at sea, the crackling of fire and more. It‚Äôs amazing being taught how to slow down, love my inner self and sit listen to my own breathing. I definitely feel this app is for EVERYONE, especially for those struggling with mental and emotional thoughts. 

This app is pricey, but having had the app since 2018ish - till now; we have been sent many coupons from the creator to continue it - at great discounted rates. It no doubt saved us a lot of money in the long run by simply signing up once and paying the amount requested (they hook you up!). 

My only complaint is listening to female narrators. It‚Äôs so so so so so not my favorite! We need men narrators as a second option - more often! I‚Äôm not sure why or how, but the men narrators provide me more relief than the women. I definitely prefer listening to the calming voice of men in this CALM app. Hope this helps! üíú",False,calm,571800810,

I have no problem compensating a developer for creating an app. I don‚Äôt. But I would rather pay $5-$10 up front as was once the app way of doing business. No longer. The more popular the app, the more the money factor kicks in. Now, the app is ‚Äúfree‚Äù - free to download and free to access a few token features. ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù was a nice idea. Now it‚Äôs big business. And I mean BIG. Yeah, they have a ‚Äúfree‚Äù version but the vast majority of content will set you back $69.99 a year!

It‚Äôs the little guys - the kitchen table creators that accomplish that. But once they get too popular, the lure of big money does them in every time.

There is music, guided meditation, stretching, stories, soundscapes and more that I haven‚Äôt even used yet. All of the material is tailored - for a certain level of user (neophyte to expert), a certain situation (stress, anxiety, sleep, city life, etc.), or a given amount of time.

My issue is with the content vs. pricing structure. The subscription is annual. That‚Äôs it. No monthlies or quarterlies. Annual, with a 7-day trial.

The problem is... this app still feels very much like it was released years ago, on a Verizon Droid phone (the ones with the big clock and weather on Home page). There is that suspicious, rough-around-the-edges ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù that just screams ‚Äú2012!!!‚Äù

As for the content, most of it, except the Calm-exclusive stories and ambient sounds, is available on Spotify or Apple Music (or Deezer or etc etc etc). So you‚Äôre paying a flat $70 for an app that still feels like it is milking a business model created in 2016 (but it‚Äôs been 5 years), while also paying for that same content on your preferred music streaming service. Think about that for a moment, and now think about the pricing structure.

Imagine paying an annual fee for Safari (even if the fee were $50), so that you could ‚Äúask website not to track you.‚Äù That‚Äôs what this feels like at times.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. The stories are nice. The ambient sounds are nice and high quality. But that‚Äôs it. I think a reassessment of both, the UI experience and products offered, and the pricing options, could go a long way. That is, if the execs at Calm Inc. still find their vision viable.

I can say I really enjoyed the ""How to Meditate"" series, and the layout is very pretty and simple, but that was all I could really get into. 
With all due respect, I found the main narrator's voice more distracting and bothersome than relaxing. I found myself getting slightly startled or jumping whenever she spoke up throughout meditations that were meant to help me sleep. This never happened with other guided meditations I've followed or with my hynotherapist, who've all had soothing voices. I tried changing narrator, as suggested by Calm, but on all of the meditations I've been using, there are no other voice options. 

Meditation aside, the other features on the app are nice, however, I can find soundscapes and peaceful music on Youtube, Spotify or other free soundscape apps.

It‚Äôs so laughably ridiculous since I thought the limited edition of the app would be better. I got this app since lately I have been feeling extremely anxious and stressed the past few months!

Especially since there is no other app in the App Store which offers a variety of techniques to help me deal with the problems I have been dealing with lately! I enter the app and immediately get told most of the items are behind a paywall which is bad enough! But I find some items are available. So I think, Oh well I‚Äôll try those  instead. Today I tried the 7 days of managing stress session. The session was awesome! And I felt so relaxed and more focused after the first session! But to my anger I saw unfortunately even for the sessions which are available you can only do the first day!  The locks on those days which indicate the paywall are so barely visible I didn‚Äôt notice them until now at a closer glance.Thanks to this awful  realization my stress actually came back! My nerves flared! My ticklish feeling came back! And my mind became back to feeling restless! Ironic isn‚Äôt it you stupid devs?!

There have been numerous reviews posted stating this same thing about the latest update and we, your users (many of us, like myself, paid Premium users) are frustrated and the developers at Calm have not responded to a single review regarding this latest update which has caused the app to be rendered completely useless. At the very least, the developers at Calm should be responding to the myriad of disgruntled customers of the Calm app regarding when a fix update is to be expected, or if a fix is even being worked on. That‚Äôs just basic customer service 101. Yet, it‚Äôs nothing but radio silence from the Calm app developers. 

I am a Premium paid subscriber and have used, and loved, Calm for quite a number of years. I specifically use Calm for the soundscapes to fall asleep to every single night. However, Calm is not the only app which offers these soothing soundscapes and if you Calm developers don‚Äôt start responding to us, your users who have built your app into the very popular app it has become, we will start canceling our subscriptions and use other very similar apps with nearly identical features who also provide basic customer service to their users, something you at the Calm app are sorely lacking!

A week ago, prior to the update which killed the app from launching and then seeing that nobody from the Calm app was acknowledging the upset users of the Calm app, I would have given the app 5 stars... after this PR debacle I would give you ZERO STARS if I were able to, as you at the Calm app have shown just how little you care about your users and their experience with your app. Shame on you, Calm!",False,calm,571800810,"{'id': 21407268, 'body': 'So sorry for the trouble you\'ve experienced!

I was sorely mistaken. When I reached out to their customer service team yesterday, no one was available to reach out and get any information on my cancellation request. This morning at 1:00 am, I get an email from Valerii in the Customer Care department explaining the pending charge process, and that my service will be cancelled as of today.

I recall downloading this app probably around 7+ years ago or whenever it first began (it was awhile ago) and it was meh. Seriously meh. Now? It‚Äôs a lot better. I‚Äôll admit that. For what I can speak of, after giving it a spin for the last hour or so. It‚Äôs pretty cool when it comes to almost every other app: I can actually check on something else and close out the app and it will still play. Great. BUT! I have two really big issues: 1) Advertising a famous voice which is literally only a few minutes of the WHOLE APP. Inaccurate advertising. Prove me wrong? Then yeah I‚Äôll pay you all the fees worthy of proper advertisement. 2) So, I downloaded the app which immediately told me that it would be 1 week (6 days) for FREE and then I would have ‚Äúthe option‚Äù to cancel or to be charged the yearly amount which was something like $69‚Äî (don‚Äôt quote me on that, I don‚Äôt remember the exact amount). Nevertheless, within the literal SECOND after I downloaded this app (where all my Apple payments are connected to a PayPal account) I INSTANTLY got a PayPal notification pop up on my phone REGARDING THIS APP that charged me $21.22! Seriously! THE FIRST WEEK ISN‚ÄôT FREE!!!!!!!???? What is this payment? Please refund and/or explain. Cancel my account, while you‚Äôre at it. And please be clear in your advertisements. Aside all this supposed, misleading small print, I think this app could actually be pretty great and I would use it quite often. I‚Äôve spoken with others who‚Äôve had similar issues.

I love falling asleep to the sound of someone telling a story or two people conversing. So of course I downloaded the app and was quit excited to try it last night. What I had missed when I had simply installed it from the YouTube page was the ability to scroll through the full page of information provided in The App Store. What‚Äôs sad is that even on that page the only clue you get that this will cost money is a bit of a ways below the ‚Äúget‚Äù button where you see the ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù app tab and above that is says ‚Äúsubscriptions‚Äù. 

So if you miss that little snippet of info you won‚Äôt realize you have to pay for anything until you go to use the app. The first page that popped up saying ‚Äú7 day trial, then only 69.99 yearly‚Äù I figured was for some sort of premium version of the app, so I closed that message and scrolled through the stories.

No where in ANY of their ads do they mention this app cost money. Not in the ad it‚Äôs self, not in the information bar, there is nothing to tell you it will cost 70$ per year for this app. The ONLY clues that it will cost a dime is the way it is listed in the App Store I mentioned above AND the complaints left by people in the comments on the ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù YouTube ads for when you go look for them and the customer comment 3rd from the left (at the moment). Seriously! How hard is it to list an app as a subscription right at the top? Instead of just saying ‚Äúinstall‚Äù or ‚Äúget‚Äù they should make that button say ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù.

It‚Äôs got everything I need. I have a diagnosis of C-PTSD, anxiety disorder, and depression from extreme trauma. I knew I needed to help myself, but I was so new to meditation. There‚Äôs so much out there, it made me feel overwhelmed and I just wanted to give up. This app. took me from not knowing anything to teaching me breathing techniques to calm me nerves. It may take a few weeks (on any app) to feel a difference, but stay on course and try to meditate at least every other day in the beginning. I had stomach problems because of my stress. I had to get procedures done only to find out nothing was wrong. I was on my floor, curled in a ball, crying because my stomach was in so much pain. This is gross, but I had loose stools for months as well. I have a degree in psychology, so I do know that our stomachs are our ‚Äúsecond brain.‚Äù Research that. It‚Äôs interesting and so true. Now that I‚Äôve been meditating for a month, my stomach issues are GONE. You don‚Äôt have to sit perfectly straight or sit on the floor. I sit on my bed with my legs straight out and my head tilted downward, arms on my lap. That position relaxes me. Find what relaxes you and go with it. Some like to sit on floors with a completely straight back, but that only made me feel uptight. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to meditate. You choose what‚Äôs comfortable. I walk and listen to it sometimes just to soothe myself. Remember, you are human and you will have random thoughts. DO NOT get frustrated with yourself. Just bring your thoughts back to meditating. If you are on a 7 day series and want to listen to day 2 over and over for the next few days because it helped you and touched you, do it. You make the rules. Whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with, you do it that way. Remember, you are retraining your brain and that takes time. Don‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôd suggest you try free trials for this app and a few more to see what you like. Everyone I‚Äôve talked to, goes back to this. It‚Äôs just amazing. Calming music, sleep stories, meditation for different issues, different meditation times. The narrators voices are so soothing. Just try it out. If you do the work, I promise, you‚Äôll see a change.

theyellowduckie,5,2020-10-30 16:38:43,Very polished app that works.,"This is a fantastic product. There are so many guided meditations you can enjoy that are very helpful in the free products that you first have access to. There's also a good variety in types and goals for your meditation focus. 

The pacing and tone of the guidance is on the slow side, which is what I happen to like. Most of the lessons are like 10-20 minutes long, so not great if you're a person who cannot dedicate that time. Some of the free products have shorter guided meditations, but there's not many. 

The background noise and overall look is very polished, so if aesthetics are what your looking for in a meditation product, just the great little videos of calming places will ease your mind. They certainly do for me. 

My one suggestion, and reason for the missing star, is that that I really want to be able to preview and purchase some of the series on the app a la carte - kinda like how you preview and purchase songs on iTunes. This product doesn't let you do that, instead you have to pay for a premium membership, which I'm not sure I can justify given how many times I am  able to meditate each month. If you're in the same boat I am, that is a definite drawback in product design for you and is something to keep in mind when downlpading the app.

10-30-2020. It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve had this app. I took the plunge and paid for premium like... 5 years ago and it‚Äôs worth it.

Then I went through the whole app and man it sucked, the only thing that was unlocked was 4 very random short stories and 2 meditations! I know it‚Äôs free, but definitely not worth downloading, I could just watch a free YouTube video instead or listen to a podcast. Then when all hope was lost I clicked on the final page, and there was the free gold, no stories, no satisfying graphics, but there were tons of different lovely sound meditations all for free, and you can pick from many scenes such as plains of wheat and snowflakes in moonlight. I love it!! You can even set a timer for how long you want it to play while clicking out of the app to do something else on your phone and you are magically transported to a new location!! I just wish that the ads were true to the app. Also, I would never in any right mind pay anywhere close to over $60 a year for this though because there is not enough on the app all together.

Since nobody from the company will probably read this I pose to any potential users, what‚Äôs the point of an app where 99.9% of the content is locked and you have to pay $69.99 per year to keep it unlocked. The app should just cost $69.99 and not be free. As Free is misleading.

I am grateful this app helps me practice meditation techniques and there are so many different ways to practice. (stories, music, short and long meditations, different back ground music/scenes, masterclasses.) At first the app taught me how to calm myself...but now I realized I am learning something more valuable...I am learning how to practice RAIN which helps me realize and acknowledge strong emotions but not get swept away by the emotions. 

So Happy International Calm Day! Thank you for teaching me ways to fall back to sleep when I realize my mind is racing due to the new stresses COVID19 pandemic has created.  

If you are wondering if this app can help...try it and be patient with yourself. Start with baby-steps, listen while you cook, clean, walk, color.  Over time I realized all the practice has helped me build a stronger foundation.  

I am forever grateful to Calm App.  We got this...May we all sleep well and get the rest we need.  Keep breathing, looking, naming, feeling, and watching the emotion pass like bubbles, balloons, clouds , waves, or ......... zzzzzzzz  zzzzzzz zzzzz.",False,calm,571800810,

Sophie_eb,3,2020-01-15 22:43:29,Great- But High Priced...,"I heard about the calm app from my school counselor. She showed us the LeBron James meditations, and I fell in love. Then my teacher started playing music from the calm app during class, so when I got home, I downloaded it. The only problem is: everything seems to be locked. I was hoping at least some of the stuff would be free, but $69.99? 
In addition, I also feel like without the subscription, it is just a demo. You aren‚Äôt really getting the whole thing, and I was disappointed when I found out. The whole thing just seems like it wants you to have the first podcast to listen to for free, then see how awesome it is, and pay for it. But I can‚Äôt afford to pay $69.99 for a meditation app, especially when there are free ones out there.
But, some pros, the podcasts and mediations are AMAZING. The people who do them have such a calming voice, and the music is my personal favorite. (I know this all from when my teacher and school counselor introduced it to us) 
But, if you do not want to spend $69.99, I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend this unless you really would like this app.",False,calm,571800810,

This type of bait and switch pricing policy is ludicrous. And in the end there isn‚Äôt even any content on the app that find useful. I‚Äôve used a number of mediation apps and I find free videos on YouTube to be far more useful and the content much more diverse than this app. I now have a $70 blue icon on my home page.

That‚Äôs $5.80 a month, or $.19 a day! Coffee costs more. Since I got it last, they have added so many amazing stories, soundscapes and meditative exercises!

It is one of those apps that is constantly bringing up the premium option. I didn't want to purchase premium because it was a bit too expense for  me. But I downloaded the app because it included sleep sounds and I needed that because I had been looking for sleep sound apps and not many I tried were good. This one seemed like the real deal to me. But you have to search and search to find a music or a sleep sound that's not premium and usually the not premium ones aren't all that good. Now I know that the point of premium is to include the better features, but I don't think all that searching for a mediocre sleep sound that's not premium isn't worth it.",False,calm,571800810,
