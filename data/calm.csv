2021-06-16 20:42:58,False,I am a teenager who would go to sleep after staring at the ceiling for about 30-45 minutes. I heard from somebody that I look up to that meditation was really good for you and that it helped her. Well for me I no longer just lay looking at the ceiling for more than half an hour. I did the sleep meditations and they really helped me and those are what I started with which is probably not how you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do it but there is no wrong or right way. I then got a little tired of the sleep meditations because I‚Äôd done them so much so then I used the soundscapes. I put a soundscape on every night before I go to sleep. I love them and love the fact that there is a sleep timer so that I can set a timer for like an hour which is well over the amount of time it takes me to fall asleep now but it‚Äôs nice to fall asleep to the sound and not have to worry about turning it off. I am also all about a healthy mindset and self care haha. So I did so many of the meditations on the little self care area (Which I love that they have that). I just recently started the ‚Äúhow to meditate‚Äù just to further understand what I‚Äôve been doing. I love it so far. I 1000% recommend this app for sleep problems or even if you‚Äôre bored in the summer and want to learn how to do something beneficial and something that could definitely help you in the long run. This was kinda a whole story but whatever hahaha. Anyways yea totally recommend this app!!!,5,I am a teenager,#Princess üëë,calm,571800810,
2020-12-06 05:17:39,False,"I updated the calm app and just out of curiosity I read some of the reviews.  I have been using the app for a while off and on, and love it.  I was curious what other people thought, and I don‚Äôt understand the critical apps.  Most are complaining that there is ‚Äòno free content‚Äô and you have to pay to get anything.  So I looked at the website without logging in just to see, since I‚Äôve been a paying customer for several years.  Nothing personal reviewers, but that‚Äôs just not so.  There are at least 4 series that you can do, some of which I‚Äôve done and found very good.  There are a smattering of sleep stories, some music, and I gave up after looking at master class and finding them all unlocked.  Yeah, there is a lot that is locked, but there is more than enough to get the experience, and no reason to look at it and say it stresses you out because it‚Äôs all behind a paywall like so many of the critical reviews say.  

It‚Äôs a very well done app.  I‚Äôve been using it for several years and still have barely scratched the surface of what‚Äôs available, and there‚Äôs always new stuff, and a new daily calm every day.  Yeah... it costs a bit, but it averages out to about 5 dollars a month, and you never run out of content, and it‚Äôs good quality.  Isn‚Äôt that worth it?  I think so.",5,Ummm,IamSporkette,calm,571800810,
2020-09-21 22:38:20,False,"I really don‚Äôt like how you have to pay to get good stuff. That makes me stressed which takes away the purpose of the app Calm. Now, I understand that, with all of the items this app has, it has to cost money, but maybe, you could make more stuff free, like maybe a seven day program or something. Maybe that would hook more users and convince them to pay for the rest. Just a thought. Without paying, the only things you really can do are the daily check ins, the little reflection thing, and a timed meditation. Once someone gets bored of that, they‚Äôll probably delete the app. You need a better way to get their attention. For example, I got the Sleep Cycle app, and I am very happy about it. It does have things that cost money, but not nearly as much money, or as many things that need money as Calm does. Most of the things in Calm cost a lot of money, and the things that are free are the things that aren‚Äôt the most helpful. Maybe this is an advertisement tactic? I‚Äôm not sure. However, in the Sleep Cycle app, the only thing that costs money is the Statistics which, honestly, I probably wouldn‚Äôt use that much. Also, it‚Äôs a lot cheaper. The things you can do without money are really cool; download the app to check it out! Over all, I have to give Calm three stars because of this, and it‚Äôs not just because it costs money, but also because of the amount of things that cost money and how much it costs.

2020-12-08 16:02:24,False,"I just wanted to leave a recommendation.  There was an ad I got where you seemed to be walking down a hall that always turned right.  The walls seemed really close on both sides.  That is terrifying.  In fact, people purposely do that in horror games to create terror.  Just want to let you know, and this is coming from a psychology student.  I seriously thought something was gonna pop out at me and when I heard it was an app called ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù I was worried you guys knew nothing of the sort.  Terror is suspense, terror is build-up and a feeling that something is there.     That‚Äôs what makes good horror games.  But not an ad to help with anxiety, I can tell you that much.  It made me so scared!  Haha.
When I checked your app, I loved the aura.  I loved the colors.  But I also have to say this.  If you‚Äôre gonna add all these extra expenses, just put it out for that amount.  If you make this downloadable on different consoles and platforms, you have more excuses to put it out for an amount too.  Some consoles and platforms have all their apps at an expense.  I can appreciate your business and understand if you want a profit (who doesn‚Äôt.). Just, being up-front is better than saying ‚ÄúUnlock this app you just downloaded‚Äù basically.
I know nothing of business, though.  I just know that I‚Äôm cheap.  The free trial is a good idea, but understand people have other options, and everyone is struggling during this time with money, too.",3,Ad Recommendation,UnluckyLadybug,calm,571800810,

I have been getting better sleep since than. Also whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious about someone or something, I listen to one of the daily calms or the next day on the meditation trial. Right away it‚Äôs as if you were brought into some beautiful relaxing world where there are these voices saying ‚ÄúIt will be ok no matter what. This will pass.‚Äù And it does its amazing how calming and peaceful this app is. Next, mood check in. The mood check in helps me express and release good and bad feelings and thoughts. Enjoy the good ones and let go of the bad ones. It even gives you a chance to write a little about them. It‚Äôs like your own personal diary, but way better. Last but definitely not least, I Believe this app can make you a better person. To be happier, to live life longer. It can be a real life changer. And just know that it‚Äôs never to late to start fresh again.  It‚Äôs never to late to change yourself.

Nothing, I mean nothing had helped me until I found this app. The meditation & sleep stories are amazing. I am so grateful for this app. Now, the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars would be due to a recommend I have for the creators, they should create a watch or something that can track your sleep & in the morning provide meditations, music, sleep stories that reflected how you slept the night before. For example, if someone woke up a lot, or of people were waking up frequently and having a hard time going back to sleep &  maybe making suggestions for  a meditation they could choose that one as more personal, or for anxiety with sleep or sleeplessness, things like that. I don‚Äôt know that would be my only recommendation, but overall and amazing app that‚Äôs worth the price.",4,"Sleep, anxiety, & life saver all in one app",CaylieHan,calm,571800810,
2020-12-03 06:15:22,False,"I love this app and use it all the time. Loads of new content added constantly. The length of the meditations is perfect. I love the series like 7 days of calm, 7 days of sleep, etc. the breathing exercises are so helpful. 

One area for improvement would be that currently most of the meditations, especially new content, is narrated by the same woman. It would be really helpful if these same sessions were recorded with a male voice, so listeners could have an option.  It would also be helpful if there were a more diverse selection of voices throughout the meditations. (This is done in the master classes and sleep stories, but I‚Äôd like to see it in the meditations too). A second area would be a review of the content of the gratitude meditations, which make assumptions and are therefore injurious for some listeners. For example I am in the middle of fighting a long term disease. Suggestions like you should be grateful for your health are not helpful and actually harmful for me. I‚Äôd really like to cultivate more gratitude but I can‚Äôt get through any of these meditations without being triggered. A review by someone working with diverse populations could help this.

The response has been so positive from my students I am thinking of doing it two days a week next year.  The students LOVE Thursday!!  They have told me it‚Äôs the favorite part for their week.

2021-04-29 00:01:18,False,"Hello, I really like the content on your app and it has really helped me to develop my practice. However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible.

2020-06-24 04:02:44,False,"Dear calm, 

I have had your app since my middle school years. I‚Äôve got to say, your app was AMAZING with 15 sleep stories and 2 and 1/2 meditations, this wasn‚Äôt a problem for me because I also use headspace. Yes, they're your competition but I wasn't choosing sides. Anyways, over time you guys added feature that you really focused on for 2 weeks at a time and just gave up on it. Next, you decreased the amount of sleep stories which was ha a huge problem for me because I was NOT getting enough sleep to keep my grades up. It got so bad that I stole my mother's phone just to sleep (she Had the Premium subscription). So I was like, ‚Äùok, I'll just use headspace ONLY for sleep and calm for meditation. Then, you took away the 7 days of calm AKA: YOUR MAIN TRIAL AND ONLY TRIAL MEDITATION LEFT after you premiumfied the 7 days of something (forgot). I mean like BRU, I have other options. I started using headspace which is a great alternative if you don't have much money. I recommend bringing back some stuff from premium and reduce the price. To counteract this, put one 15 second ad at the beginning. Of every session of meditation for people without premium. Therefore, there is more than one reason to get it and it's CHEAPER. That's a win-win situation. I hope you come to the right decision. Whatever it is, I probably wouldn't stop using the app. Thank you for your time.",3,Pls read,a ds42gme,calm,571800810,

     I wish I had more from our guide Jeff on how to meditate. I really relate to his presentation because he seems quintessentially California to me.  I‚Äôve been meditating since I was 6 or so, brought up Vedantist Hindu, born Jewish and am now a ChristianI am an aging hippie. I meditate w my cat on my lap, I simply press my hands on her sides and she grounds me and then is the anchor; her occasionally purring.  
     I love the pictures and the nature scenes. By the way I have been meditating every single day since November.  If I might be of assistance, I‚Äôm not sure how maybe I could do a Spark or something. I wish there were Something way to dialog - I have been on the site.

All of the features which this app has to offer really help me when I‚Äôm studying (I like having soundscapes or music on), relaxing (breathing exercises or meditation), and getting ready for bed (sleep stories and body scans). It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. 

One suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I‚Äôm doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can‚Äôt focus on sleeping with my thoughts). If you guys made some soft spoken or any kind of podcast in which there wasn‚Äôt a lot of yelling and loud talking, I‚Äôd totally listen in.

I also tried the free background soundtracks and music when I was trying to concentrate. All worth the price of free admission. But then I tried the mediation. I‚Äôd always thought of meditation as new age mumbo jumbo. But many of the smartest people I know all have stories about when they started doing it and how it changed their life. So on a uncharacteristically unbusy Saturday I decided to try the meditation course. And now I realize how simple and profound it all is. It‚Äôs essentially just having then skill to not let your thoughts control how you feel. Not letting your emotions get the best of you. Once you can control your impulses, you are a different person.

The app then asked me a few questions to try to determine what to recommend ‚Äî how familiar I am with meditation, how often I meditate, and what I‚Äôd like to focus on in guided meditation. It then recommended I try a one-week course on stress. I figured I would give it a try, but I did not make it 60 seconds into the very first lesson before the person leading the meditation falsely claimed that a variety of physical chronic illnesses are *caused by* stress, the same utter garbage that some people claimed to me way back when I was diagnosed over 20 years ago. I immediately stopped the course but decided to try something else before giving up on the app. I tried a few of the daily meditations, but like another recent reviewer, I found the style of the person who always leads them doesn‚Äôt really mesh with my style.

So it‚Äôs a bummer that I‚Äôm missing out on all the content recorded by her, but I am still getting a lot of use out of the app anyway. Narrating is a talent, and although not everyone is a natural at it or blessed with a soothing voice, it can be improved on with proper training, and talented narrators work on their ability to even out/lower their pitch, and avoid raspy breaking in their tone as these are the most bothersome sounds to human ears.

I also like the approach calm takes in encouraging you to develop your own daily practice of mindfulness. However, the main reason why I purchased calm was for the large library of meditations. However the bulk of new meditations come from the daily meditation which is always guided by the same person, Tamara Levitt. She also guides many of the meditation series they have available. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt enjoy how Tamara does her meditations and I find them more distracting than helpful. Because of this I find myself avoiding her meditations and whenever there is a choice for another voice I‚Äôll pick it, but there are only so many of these. And, if you‚Äôre not doing the daily meditations, it doesn‚Äôt take too long before you feel like you‚Äôre running out of content. Calm is great if you enjoy Tamara‚Äôs meditations, but your kind of out of a deal if you don‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs been very helpful to me with managing sleep and anxiety, really to life-changing levels. But I find my biggest complaint and the thing that makes me go through bouts in which I stop using it altogether is the lack of variety in narrators. Tamara Levitt is used to narrate a very large number of exercises and while her voice is positive and upbeat‚Äîshe really is lovely, I‚Äôm sure!‚Äîit‚Äôs not AT ALL relaxing and totally grinds on my nerves. I literally cannot listen to any audio that she does in this app and as I said, there are many. It‚Äôs really disappointing. I‚Äôve found the male narrators, specifically Elisha Goldstein, have a slower cadence and a much more relaxing tone that allows me to decompress and stop my anxiety attacks or drift off to sleep.

Family members would actually be better off downloading it directly because the free access only lasts one week so they‚Äôd at least get their own trial period instead of whatever remains of a family member‚Äôs.  There is fine print in the App Store which says that Family Share does not support in-app purchases and subscriptions, but nothing in the app itself will tell you that your $70 one year subscription cannot be shared with a family member or significant other.

I do have one suggestion, though.  As they are meant to do, the sleep stories often get me to sleep, but once the story ends, it is just silence.  The ambient noise helps me to stay asleep, but I can‚Äôt find a way to have the ambient noise begin once the sleep story or meditation session ends.  It would be great to be able to make a playlist of sorts where ambient noise automatically kicks in at the end of the sleep story or meditation session.

A suggestion: Since I have zero complaints, here‚Äôs a little thing for a sound series since you do some with pop music and such as calm remixes. Try to do some anime songs as a slowed down and calmer version. I bet there are more people out there who would want this as anime can be a sort of relief and break from reality and I find if it were mixed with calm it would be so much better ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,Thank you,Yessir11118,calm,571800810,

But when I got this app it saved me and whenever I feel stressed I will listen to one of the videos they recommend for me and I feel like the anxiety that has taken over me has been defeated by this app calm. I definitely recommend this app it is a life saver if you have anxiety like I do.

It was difficult to find the time or patience to start so I knew a little guidance was needed.
I tried a few popular apps and Calm has by far stood out as the BEST guided meditation I‚Äôve found anywhere.

2020-10-16 17:47:41,False,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs helpful to other people, but based solely as a meditation app this is the most cumbersome app I‚Äôve ever used. As a meditation app, what I most need is a quick way to find a session with ideal time, music, along with the amount of guidance. Calm makes browsing for this a complete nuisance.

First, there‚Äôs absolutely no way to browse or search based on time. Their Daily Calm sessions are around 10-15 minutes, but they vary by day? But if my range is around 20-30 minutes then I absolutely have to dig around different topics and collections just to see how long they are. I would have to do this every single time, which is an aggravating experience and ruins my attempt at building a daily meditation habit!

They do have a timed meditation section (sorted by time), but it‚Äôs silent with or without guidance. I just want time, music, guidance, and go.

After trying it for 3 days, I resorted to going back to a completely free app called Oak. As a sleep or music app, maybe that helps others, but the meandering stories tend to keep me awake more often than just putting on a free podcast.

But there‚Äôs so much more, and many meditations to choose from. I also enjoy the music without lyrics, and I‚Äôd like to see more of those. 

I think the only thing I take issue with is that my choices of meditations with voices are cut in half because I prefer femme/female higher voices than deeper male voices because of certain personal triggers. Other than that, this app is very helpful and there are still a lot of choices.

Another missing option is to have one of the ambient tracks, or anything, play automatically after the story.

The interface is not good for sleepers.  Controls should be large, obvious and omnipresent.  Mucking around with controls is disruptive for sleep and for those of us who do not sleep with our glasses on, (read everybody) very frustrating.

The subscription model for this is very expensive.  The idea that new stories and content is an important aspect for sleep is flawed.  Good content does not need to be replaced as familiarity only helps with falling asleep.

2020-05-27 17:37:58,False,"Calm tries very hard to cater to the emotional expectations of someone who doesn't yet understand what mindfulness is. It has ambient nature sounds, lots of voices trying really hard to be soothing, and an impressive hodgepodge of options. Unfortunately it doesn't really seem to teach much. A lot of time is spent on abstract personal anecdotes, celebrity humble brags, and portraying as many different ideas of mindfulness as possible. The very first ""How to Meditate"" session makes you listen to the teacher's life story and ideas for 3 minutes before actually explaining anything. There's no real structure or sense of progress, so there's not much to commit to. If you want to relax for 20 minutes, Calm may help.

1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings.

2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt.

2021-04-11 04:38:34,False,"I‚Äôve never written a single app review before but this one has helped me so much that I thought it only right to share my experience. About a year and a half ago I started going to a therapist for depression, anxiety, and general mental health issues. In that very first meeting with her she told me to take a proactive approach and a good way to do that is to try this app. She recommended buying the premium version and I did and honestly that was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made regarding my mental health. Now, I‚Äôm not going to sit here and say that my mental health issues are gone or that this app was a miracle cure. In fact, that‚Äôs far from the truth but I will say I use this app every single day and they‚Äôre constantly updating the content on there so that there‚Äôs something for pretty much anyone. The user interface is incredibly easy to use and you can always find whatever you‚Äôre looking for and they have a ton of options so you can try whatever looks cool. Meditation doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and that‚Äôs important to keep in mind before investing. However, if you think this app will even help you a little bit and you have 10 minutes every day to spare then I promise you won‚Äôt regret it. 
If you‚Äôve gotten this far into the review and you‚Äôve liked what I‚Äôve had to say so far then I might as well share my routine. I try to do the ‚Äúdaily calm‚Äù everyday which is always a 10 minute guided meditation and it‚Äôs different everyday. There are also so many short meditations to chose from and some of them can be for specific emotions or situations which can also be really helpful. Having an anxiety disorder (or really a disorder of any kind) makes it incredibly difficult to think in present time and focus on the present moment, but the meditations on here have made that less of an obstacle. The thing about meditation is that it grounds you while you‚Äôre doing it, but it also trains your brain to stay grounded in your daily life as well and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so often used to treat mental health issues and that‚Äôs why it works. 
I also use the app when I go to bed because they have sleep stories, meditations for bedtime, music, and white noise sounds that will play until you tell the app to stop. The section on sleep is probably my favorite part of the app because getting a healthy amount of sleep used to be a huge issue of mine and now my sleep schedule has gotten so much better. Honestly if all of the other meditations didn‚Äôt exist I probably still would‚Äôve bought the app solely because of how much it‚Äôs helped me sleep!

2020-06-09 14:16:47,False,So I‚Äôve only just turned nine but I have trouble falling asleep at night. Not because I‚Äôm worried or anxious or anything but my mind races with thoughts. I like to read for a while at night because I heard it was relaxing but when I put it down to fall asleep but I can‚Äôt because I get caught up in the story. I‚Äôm not saying no one should read at night. I just have a lot of trouble falling asleep. My mom got this app. (I don‚Äôt really know why because I‚Äôm not a lot of trouble but on the other hand my brother really is.) And I kept seeing ads for it so when this pandemic started I just tried it. The pandemic really got me off schedule. When we were still in school waking up at 6:45 AM was easy cause I was able to fall asleep at 9:00 PM but now during the pandemic we were able to wake up at 9:00 AM and I wouldn‚Äôt fall asleep till really late. Anyway enough about me more about the app. Your probably thinking this review is trash but just wait I‚Äôm gonna talk about the app. So the app is amazing even without the premium subscription. I started a while ago so you can take my word for it. I loved this app the second I started it but day after day I used it and grew to love it so much. My very first one was taking breaths and focusing and your breathing and just your breathing. I was trying to fall asleep that night but couldn‚Äôt but after I did that right when my head hit the pillow I was asleep. This is the best calming meditation app you could own. Don‚Äôt delete it if you didn‚Äôt like your first one. Try another and another I know you will love it.
