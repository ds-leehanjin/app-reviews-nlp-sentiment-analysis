I use this app takeaway twice a day in the morning to make my day, and at night to help me get a good rest.",cootiegurl,innerhour-self-care-therapy,1323264990
False,1,2020-11-01 00:24:55,hypocrisy,"it’s funny bc when i was filling out the questionnaire one of the reasons they give you for potentially being depressed is lack of money. y’all really have a lot of gall and audacity putting that as an option and then charging people for the very reason they’re downloading your app in the first place, just ridiculous. at least make it a cheaper price? at least a one time fee. or better yet just make charge to download the actual app so people don’t waste their time, and get even more depressed that they can’t afford treatment.  believe or not people are poor. will still continue to use the app and use other features but i was really excited to embark on my customized plan.",Swaggiemcswagpants,innerhour-self-care-therapy,1323264990
