2,False,The AI is frustrating sometimes,"This app has some helpful tools, but the way the AI works can be frustrating. For example, you can be in the middle of making a safety plan, but if you say the words, ‘panic attack’ when it asks about your triggers the AI switches to the script for dealing with panic attacks and you can’t go back to finishing the safety plan as far as I can tell. The app is a good idea that needs some finesse.",Invisible Watcher,2021-03-21 19:17:49,moodtools-depression-aid,1012822112
