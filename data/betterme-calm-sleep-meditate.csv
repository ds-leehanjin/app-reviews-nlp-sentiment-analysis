This is the best thing that happened to me. I don’t know what I would do without it, and whether I would be here right now. It is a lifesaver! I was having a rough time when I stumbled upon this app. Although I was skeptical about it, I downloaded it because at that point I could use anything, literally anything. I have talked to a therapist, and my friends, and mom, and nothing helped. I stumbled upon this app and decided to give it a try. The first week I didn’t see any changes. I was thinking of giving up, and telling my therapist that it didn’t work, but something about me feeling a little more relaxed that made me want to keep trying. And I'm glad I did! I can't even express how good it felt when I finally managed to relax completely. It’s like I was in a bathtub filled with boiling glue, and then just jumped onto a light and fluffy cloud – that is how it felt to finally set myself free from all those problems and haunting thoughts. I began to notice how beautiful nature is, and how good it felt to have fun with friends or be near people who love and support me. I began to notice all that and appreciate it. I don’t know if I would have done it without the help of meditation, but what I do know is that it has changed me, and I am very grateful for that!",betterme-calm-sleep-meditate,1363010081

I’m sure that everyone has a period in their life when everything seems like it’s falling apart and there is nothing you can do about it. Well, that is basically what my life has been like since middle school. I am really bad at managing stress and stressful situations, so I find myself worrying a lot and always have a lot on my mind. My friend recommended that I should try meditation and that it would help me relax. I tried it a couple of times, but I just couldn’t relax completely. My thoughts kept racing around in my head and I became frustrated that I couldn’t just let go. I felt discouraged because if I couldn’t control my own thoughts, how could I control my own life? 

When I stumbled upon this app, I decided to give my meditation practice another try, and it worked. It worked because I realized that you can’t control your thoughts and you should never try to. What you do need to do is to accept them and accept yourself. This app helped me realize what I needed and helped me completely relax for probably the first time in my life! I wanted to share my experience so that if you are going through the same thing, I highly recommend you download this app, and trust it and let it guide you!

The next week I was charged AGAIN so I finally opened another line of communication and got a response that the membership had been canceled and that someone would reach out about my refund.

Hm, honestly, I’m glad I was wrong))
There are so many options, and it’s extremely easy to filter what you need, from how you feel to whether or not you want music, a male voice or a female voice or just music and what kind.
The guided meditations (on the phone app, at least) are geared towards different focuses, such as Anxiety"",, ""Deep Sleep"", “Stress” etc. I found these to be really helpful when I first started learning how to meditate last year, especially the ""Deep Sleep"" one. This particular guided meditation helped me calm my mind before going to bed each night, which led to incredibly restful nights that left me very refreshed and energetic in the morning.
I highly recommend it because of its incredible nature sounds, ambient music for falling asleep and simple interface. One downside though is that the app sometimes has glitches which annoy me a little. 4/5",betterme-calm-sleep-meditate,1363010081

There’s a couple of 7 day courses you can take voiced by a woman or robot, I can’t tell, but her pace is so unnatural and monotonic that it’s hard to differentiate between her and Siri. It actually is so distracting, you lose focus on being in the present and I found myself wondering when it was going to be over.

Finally caved in and clicked the link to see what’s it all about. 

Realized I had to have a subscription to even view most content. Closed out the app without any purchase. Later received a discount for $20/year plan and decided to go for it...

Took roughly 48 hours for me to get login information from the support team. Stressful and disappointing. Albeit there was a delay, however we got to a solution. Finally, day three after purchase I could to use the app. 

The GUI is ergonomic enough, but there is little guidance offered. No description or tutorials, where to begin directions, you’re just kinda dropped in this meditation box.

The features aren't plentiful, but there is enough to get you going on a meditative road to less anxiety. The hardest aspect to overcome is the narrated guided meditation practice that is voiced by a robotic, mono-tonal computer. Being told to do such and such, think such and such, by an unempathetic robot voice is tacky feeling.

3/5 stars. Would use at $20 yearly subscription for one year, unlikely to resubscribe. Would not suggest this app to my IRL associates.",betterme-calm-sleep-meditate,1363010081
