Mediocre app and they keep stealing my money,LmMc1008,"I bought a one week trial period and after one day realized it was not something I wanted or needed. It‚Äôs a mediocre app and I didn‚Äôt want to continue with the membership after the trial period. No big deal... I wasted $5 but that‚Äôs the chance you take in a trial period. I stopped using the app after the one time I checked it out and emailed to cancel that same day and was told I didn‚Äôt need to cancel anything because it was just a trial period. The next week I was charged again so I sent another email with no response. The next week I was charged again so I sent yet another email and received no response. The next week I was charged AGAIN so I finally opened another line of communication and got a response that the membership had been canceled and that someone would reach out about my refund. It took a long time for that email to come but when it finally did they gave me the option to have 6 months of a free membership (a membership I don‚Äôt want or need) OR I could choose to get half of the money back, that they weren‚Äôt supposed to charge me. I am not asking for my trial period money back. Just all of the money they charged after I canceled multiple times. This is crappy customer service. There are plenty of other meditation apps that are better and have more to offer that are free or significantly cheaper and won‚Äôt rip you off!",1,2021-02-28 00:12:17,"{'id': 21812438, 'body': ""Hello!

Feel ripped off,Jray-420,Idk what I just spent $20 on to then ask me to pay even more for what I thought was apart of that ‚Äúlimited on time offer‚Äù and the 1st article I read which was about rage and anger already stopped reading after number one because it says to tell him ‚Äú you know I don‚Äôt like it when you do this‚Äù and you statements. As someone who has been in an a hold of therapy since I was young due to depression I know that you‚Äôre not supposed to make statements like that especially when you‚Äôre talking about an angry situation you‚Äôre supposed to make ice statements it makes me feel this way because then you‚Äôre just making that person think that you‚Äôre attacking them.

Purchased from Ad,tiggert23,"So I had been wanting an app related specifically for realigning chakras and I believe I saw an ad for this one. So after purchasing two separate things which total to almost about $15 I finally tried it and unfortunately I was not impressed. There‚Äôs a couple of 7 day courses you can take voiced by a woman or robot, I can‚Äôt tell, but her pace is so unnatural and monotonic that it‚Äôs hard to differentiate between her and Siri. It actually is so distracting, you lose focus on being in the present and I found myself wondering when it was going to be over. And at the end it just abruptly cuts off after stating to continue to meditate. Totally the opposite of relaxing.I‚Äôm not sure how to discontinue this subscription since it‚Äôs not through the App Store but I will not be renewing.",3,2021-01-04 10:16:37,"{'id': 20195680, 'body': 'Hello!

Was I expecting too much?,LaowaiGram,"The app was directed to me through Instagram. Finally caved in and clicked the link to see what‚Äôs it all about. 

Realized I had to have a subscription to even view most content. Closed out the app without any purchase. Later received a discount for $20/year plan and decided to go for it...

Took roughly 48 hours for me to get login information from the support team. Stressful and disappointing. Albeit there was a delay, however we got to a solution. Finally, day three after purchase I could to use the app. 

The GUI is ergonomic enough, but there is little guidance offered. No description or tutorials, where to begin directions, you‚Äôre just kinda dropped in this meditation box.

The features aren't plentiful, but there is enough to get you going on a meditative road to less anxiety. The hardest aspect to overcome is the narrated guided meditation practice that is voiced by a robotic, mono-tonal computer. Being told to do such and such, think such and such, by an unempathetic robot voice is tacky feeling.

3/5 stars. Would use at $20 yearly subscription for one year, unlikely to resubscribe. Would not suggest this app to my IRL associates.",3,2021-05-12 12:08:29,"{'id': 23365664, 'body': 'Hello!

Disappointing,TreeLizard386,"Highly recommend trying ANY OTHER meditation app. I gave 2 stars because the sound mixer is the only thing I liked about this app. The voices in the meditations are awful and super distracting.
