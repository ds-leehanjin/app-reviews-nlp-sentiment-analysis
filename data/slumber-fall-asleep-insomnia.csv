2020-07-05 19:00:54,False,Baby boom mama,5,"Slumber allows you to pick from several modalities of talk oriented sleep inducing paradigms. Dream Stories are bedtime stories which guide you into sleep and relaxation. Ex:  “The Deep Dive” obviously written by a scuba diver, talks you thru a dive so accurate and intense you feel you are actually experiencing the dive. With “The Distant Storm” you feel you are on a beach, w warm sun and sand at sunset, listening to the waves and watching a beautiful storm in the distance.  The stories are engrossing yet very relaxing and sleep inducing.  Sleep Meditations are less involved w the story line and much more involved w your body and thoughts and tensions keeping you awake. Thru breathing techniques and progressive relaxation you are in almost a state of self hypnosis and gently encouraged to let go of all thoughts and sleep. W both the Stories and the Meditations u set up your preferred background sounds which continue for as long as you choose. I usually use headphones w either my phone or my iPad, since in your background settings there are Binaural beats which encourage alpha stage sleep, but I sometimes just put my head near my device and listen.  It’s a wonderful feeling to realize you have been sleeping and you can just turn over and go back to sleep.",Best overall sleep app available.,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

1. Would love to be able to see more of a historical timeline that tells you which story you listened to on which day and what time you started it. Right now it just gives you a streak number which tbh is a bit stupid because it isn’t always accurate. I’ve listened to stories before and then it doesn’t count them for some reason so my streak resets. 

2.  This happened to me last night for the first time but I guess I ran into an error in the middle of the story. I don’t know the specifics because I was sleeping when it happened but essentially, the story stopped at some point and then it just kept playing the soundscape in the background. Which is fine, I don’t necessarily have a problem with that if something goes wrong. However, it continued past the length of the story and just kept playing. And that’s the part that I think needs to be fixed because it ended up waking me up in the middle of the night which kind of ruins the whole point of using this app in the first place to fall asleep properly.",Couple suggestions,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

I don’t have severe insomnia or anything like that, but have for awhile had problems with waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get back to sleep.

I use a soft Bluetooth speaker headband and keep it on low all night long.  For lack of a better description, it gives my brain something to “latch on” to if I wake up instead of whatever else (snippets of conversations, songs, things I read the day before etc.) is banging around in my head.

You are probably tired of me updating my reviews all of the time, but I have a view suggestions. Over all this is a great app, but I find myself getting bored of the same stories. I don’t know if you actually communicate with the narrators or the writers, but here are some story ideas. “Airline Slumber” I love planes and having a story about it would be great! “The Australian Train Ride” I love the train stories and the Australian train rides are extremely beautiful. “North Carolina Trails” maybe walking through the woods on a relaxing hike, finally reaching the top of the mountain. Also, I understand it is harder to record two people doing the same story, but I would like it if we could have a choice for a female or male voice. You all are probably working very hard during these rough times, and I would like your team to know that y’all are helping so many people, and all of y’all are worth it.

This is probably one of my only apps that was worth spending money on. And I mean ALL of my apps, not just the sleep ones.

I love that they add new stories and narrations often, and it’s fun that Slumber releases seasonally-appropriate stories (pumpkin stuff in autumn, cherry blossom viewing in spring). You can also toggle a variety of white noise options (rain, birds) to superimpose on the narration if you like.

The only change I might suggest is an option to delay the start of the program after the user presses play, maybe just 30 seconds or a minute or two, because after I start the selection I still need to get comfortable and say goodnight to my hubby, and my rustling around makes it hard to hear the very beginning of the story.

With her French, Elaine I believe her name is, is really good except for the fact that she’s too fast. She needs to slow it down a tad. In fact it would be my advice to all of the Sleep narrators to go about the speed of the male French whisperer. He is very good even if it was a microscopic amount slower it might be even better. And my to only complaints are,The writers would write better. Andthat there would be more visuals, poetic wording with colors and relics, the writer needs to put a tad more sophistication I am just saying it would be great if it were like Calm – Alan Sklar – the Easter island. Is very good writing, very poetic and full of visuals and mystery. Now back to the French whisperer, he speaks is so caring to his audience. You can feel theCaring concern for the audience to fall to sleep. He has it at such a great ability in this area, to convey that he love & cares and it is very soothing. I do wish that he would read more clear. I cannot understand all his words. I am part French so I do like listening to a French accent but I wish that I could hear the English annunciation better. Thank you for reading my message. You have a great thing going. Unfortunately I only like the French whisperer and Elaine the female French whisperer. But like I said I can’t go to sleep with Elaine because she reads too fast.I especially like how she has a nice low voice. I have a low voice as well.
Please do keep writing more history sleep stories. I believe there is a speaker by the name of TJ who sounds just like alan‘s glory.

2021-03-01 07:52:14,False,Xhfeu,3,"Edit: Editing this review because, while I appreciate that they actually have been adding new free stories like I suggested, they have locked previously free ones. My all time favorite was the Birds of Yosemite. Great narrator, beautiful musings about nature, and it is now locked. Previously permanent free stories should be grandfathered in, even if new free ones since the change are on a rotating basis (idk if they are but i cant think of why else they would lock old free ones). Dreams of Grasmere is also locked now and that one was also pretty successful at helping me sleep. Sidenote, I just checked the premium price and its now $40/yr, which is not as ridiculous a price as it was before

- - -
This app is fantastic, the stories help my brain focus on the narrative rather than a bunch of inner chaotic thoughts, which helps me fall asleep. I especially love The Birds of Yosemite, which seems to be a reading of an actual published journal of some sort. And it has such rich and beautiful descriptions and the narrator does a wonderful job. The optional sound effects & mixing are also very subtle & pleasant. HOWEVER I have to knock my review down a whole two stars because there is such a small handful of free episodes. Only someone with a superfluous amount of spending money would pay $10/mo for a single sleep app, as much as it may help their (my) chronic insomnia. I would love to fall asleep to more nature journals, or more simple stories like The Cats Journey, but there has not been a single new free episode in the months I’ve had this app. And the problem with listening to the same stories over and over is that your brain starts to tune them out because they are familiar, and instead becomes overrun with thoughts once again and stays awake. If the devs would consider at least releasing ONE new free story for every 5 or 10 new locked stories (new locked stories get released at an impressive rate), I would easily give the app 5 stars.",(NEW EDIT) Good app BUT,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

The daring story of a princess journeying to a Cat Kingdom, befriending cats of all kinds, and a great rescue kept me awake all the way through it, but I did eventually fall asleep. I am a very rough sleeper. I’m terrible at falling asleep, and sometimes it takes hours. This has put me asleep so quickly, and this is only my first day using it! Me and my family are about to go on a LONG trip to California, and I will definitely listen to these stories while on the road. It’s strange, but road noises seem to soothe me...

Dear Abbe Opher,
Hello! I am 10 years old, and I really like your The White Cat story. I am super excited to hear your other stories, and I’d like to say, your voice is very soothing! Keep up your great work. ✌🏻🥳🌟.    Sincerely, Catelyn Calvert in Texas

Dear Nadine Brown,
Hello! I am 10 years old, and I love your The Sleepy Caterpillar story! It put my brother to sleep, and I don’t think he’s waking up anytime soon. The serenity of being a caterpillar sounds so soothing and nice; the chocolate acorns, bird siblings, and the sleepy cocoon. It makes me think of what it REALLY would be like. Your story was the first story I heard on this app, and I thank, thank, thank you for getting my brother to sleep. He’s a little ball of energy and won’t stop talking.   Sincerely, Catelyn Calvert in Texas

Thank you so, so, so, much for this amazing app. But for now, I am going to fall asleep to a beautiful story about a princess and a white cat...",What an amazing adventure; all in my own tablet!,slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

2020-12-26 18:45:32,False,RightKitKatie,3,"Summary: A lovely app with more than just stories for bedtime. A few convenience and quality issues, but once resolved, I would gladly buy the lifetime access. 

The Good: Readers for story time have soothing voices that are easy to focus on and they make me feel sleepy even when I’m working with the stories as background noise. There’s a large range in length, from 10 minutes to 1 hour. Not just stories, the app includes meditations and sound scapes, so you can use the app for more than just sleeping. 

Suggestions: The stories can’t be filtered by length, which means you have to scroll through and look at each one to find one of your preferred length. Definitely annoying when I only want a quick 10 minute story that won’t get interrupted/cut off. There’s also no way filter between items you’ve listened to and those you haven’t. You can favorite items, which I enjoy, but if I didn’t like a story and wanted to find a new one, it’d be nice if I could look through the ones I’ve not yet heard. I also wish I could queue up stories or meditations. Sometimes I’m not trying to sleep, but just relax, so it’d be nice if I could listen to more than one in a row, rather than just one long one.

The Bad: I’m not sure if they got some recordings from elsewhere or paid the readers to work for them individually, but one of them in particular (Dan Jones) fumbles some words and has to stop and restart a few times (most notably in the dragon series and The Boy Who Ran Away to the Circus). Whomever the audio editor was did a poor job and the mistakes make it hard to fall asleep. I actively avoid works with Dan Jones now, even though he’s one of the most available readers on the platform, simply because the audio editor was sloppy. It’s the most irritating thing for me and why would I pay to listen to a story where there wasn’t any effort put in to the quality?

Free Trial: The free trial was nice, though I didn’t get access to as many stories as I see available for pay now (though it may also be since they upload regularly). So long as you cancel the subscription before the expiration date, you won’t get charged. Make sure it’s not on the day of the expiration, but rather a day or two before. Even if you cancel it, you still get access until it expires.","Lovely stories, some issues",slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia,1109543953,

Also you can keep the background music on even after the story ends. Fabulous.

There are a couple depressing ones I avoid now, one being the monk and the man seems too dark, but tons of others that put me in a happy dreamy land.

2020-07-18 02:14:39,False,Heftybags,3,"Let me start by saying I’m a premium subscriber and have been for a while I use this app daily and cost vs value is quite high, there is no other subscription (Netflix, Apple Music, etc.) that gets used for at least 8 hours a day every day.

The stories themselves are generally very good and interesting in a way to doze off to and easy to fall back asleep when waking up in the middle of a sleep session (you can loop the stories which is a huge plus the majority of these types of apps just stop when the narration ends), of course not all of them are going to be for everyone but the selection is great enough when a new story is released that I don’t like I don’t really mind because of all the other content to choose from.  Anyone thinking of subscribing it’s well worth it. 

The non 5 star rating is app related not content related. 

Each story needs to have an option to select at least one other narrator if you dislike a narrator then a whole lot of content is useless. For me and many others it’s the French Whisperer one of the more recent stories is the history of vampires I got excited until I seen it was French Whisperer so there is another story that is unlistenable but having an option to change would open much content to so many people and also drive up subscriptions. 

The new layout for stories is horrible. The font and colors are different on everyone of them no more quick scrolling through a standard list with the same font and color to find what you want. What use to be quick is now a chore you’re brain has to look at and process each story because of this it’s not a great user experience. 

The sorting for each group is not intuitive. The app needs an option to sort by title, narrator, popularly, release date and length.  I would also like to be able to play a soundscape and story at the same time how cool would it be to listen to The River Raft and Bear Creek or Exploring a Lucid Dream and Fire on the Beach or A California Train Ride and The Sleeper Car, you get the point this would open a lot of possibilities as it is now the background effects are pitiful compared to other apps in fact I use Relax Melodies or Sound.ly for background sounds to compliment the story but shouldn’t have to when paying a premium, Slumber needs to add a full catalog of background effects.
