Happy meditating !', 'modified': '2021-02-22T16:25:43Z'}","I purchased this app because I loved their meditations in sleep cycle. After sleep cycle removed them, I was excited to access more of the meditations that I‚Äôd come to enjoy so much. Unfortunately, this app doesn‚Äôt have the same quality meditations as they produced for sleep cycle. Also, for me at least, I can never get the app to work when I lock my screen. It just stops playing. Since I use it for sleep, this is annoying both because of the phone light and because it‚Äôll auto lock anyways. I wanted to love this app, but I think it needs a lot of improvements.","Great, but doesn‚Äôt work when the screen is locked",3,marms28,2021-02-20 01:20:20,mindfulness-with-petit-bambou,941222646
False,,"There are lots of good meditation apps available. Each one has particular strengths and weaknesses. Most have an introductory course. Petit BamBou has the best introductory courses, Basics 1-4. It exposes you to a wide range of techniques that will really help you notice things about how your mind works that you never noticed before. The weakness of Petit BamBou is that is often sounds like the guide is reading a script. It‚Äôs a good script but at times the vocal pacing sounds like the guide is just reading the words rather than spontaneously saying them. Nonetheless, the content and detail of the guidance is very good.",Basics,4,DrMECtistopher,2021-02-17 19:16:28,mindfulness-with-petit-bambou,941222646

I downloaded a couple of apps and ended up feeling like a dummy, which I was, I just didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it I guess.
