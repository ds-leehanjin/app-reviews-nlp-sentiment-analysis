    "> <font size=2em>The Data Science Process we'll be using during this section--OSEMiN (pronounced \"OH-sum\", rhymes with \"possum\").  This is the most straightforward of the Data Science Processes discussed so far.  **Note that during this process, just like the others, the stages often blur together.***  It is completely acceptable (and ***often a best practice!) to float back and forth** between stages as you learn new things about your problem, dataset, requirements, etc.  \n",
    "It's quite common to get to the modeling step and realize that you need to scrub your data a bit more or engineer a different feature and jump back to the \"Scrub\" stage, or go all the way back to the \"Obtain\" stage when you realize your current data isn't sufficient to solve this problem. \n",
    "As with any of these frameworks, *OSEMiN is meant to be treated as guidelines, not law. \n",

    "- This step involves understanding stakeholder requirements, gathering information on the problem, and finally sourcing data that we think will be necessary for solving this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SCRUB**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this stage, we'll focus on preprocessing our data.  Important steps such as identifying and removing null values, dealing with outliers, normalizing data, and feature engineering/feature selection are handled around this stage.  The line with this stage really blurs with the _Explore_ stage, as it is common to only realize that certain columns require cleaning or preprocessing as a result of the visualzations and explorations done during Step 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that although technically, categorical data should be one-hot encoded during this step, in practice, it's usually done after data exploration.  This is because it is much less time-consuming to visualize and explore a few columns containing categorical data than it is to explore many different dummy columns that have been one-hot encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXPLORE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step focuses on getting to know the dataset you're working with. As mentioned above, this step tends to blend with the _Scrub_ step mentioned above.  During this step, you'll create visualizations to really get a feel for your dataset.  You'll focus on things such as understanding the distribution of different columns, checking for multicollinearity, and other tasks liek that.  If your project is a classification task, you may check the balance of the different classes in your dataset.  If your problem is a regression task, you may check that the dataset meets the assumptions necessary for a regression task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end of this step, you should have a dataset ready for modeling that you've thoroughly explored and are extremely familiar with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step, as with the last two frameworks, is also pretty self-explanatory. It consists of building and tuning models using all the tools you have in your data science toolbox.  In practice, this often means defining a threshold for success, selecting machine learning algorithms to test on the project, and tuning the ones that show promise to try and increase your results.  As with the other stages, it is both common and accepted to realize something, jump back to a previous stage like _Scrub_ or _Explore_, and make some changes to see how it affects the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**iNTERPRET**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this step, you'll interpret the results of your model(s), and communicate results to stakeholders.  As with the other frameworks, communication is incredibily important! During this stage, you may come to realize that further investigation is needed, or more data.  That's totally fine--figure out what's needed, go get it, and start the process over! If your results are satisfactory to all stakeholders involved, you may also go from this stage right into productionizing your model and automating processes necessary to support it.  \n",

While using stoicism as a framework, this app has really been a way for me to practice personal reflection and awareness, cultivating better emotional wellness. Easily accessible techniques for gratitude, journaling, meditation, and breathing exercises without the pressure of any one thing being a requirement. The app guides you to those tools through a pleasant sequence without any pressure to use specific techniques. It’s so gentle. If you want to journal, then journal. If you want to meditate, then do that. And if you don’t, that’s ok too. It’s totally up to you. I find tremendous value in the simple act of making these sequences a part of my daily morning and evening routine; from simply opening the app and assessing how I feel to what my priority for the day is to how productive I felt. The app now even guides personal reflection towards specific categories. If in the morning I say I’m going to focus on reading, in the evening the app will then guide me to reflect on recalling what I read that day. So simple, but so helpful.

It’s iconic honestly. Not to forget the fact that it’s been lifting burdens and weights off of my back when I type everything in details. It’s like a friend that I’ve always wanted, which is sad because none of my real (alive) friends are there for me and asks me how I am like how stoic is🥲 Ever since the app asked me the first question, I’ve poured allllll of the things I wanted to say and in details too. I- this app is like that one friend that you have that’s always there for you no matter what and genuinely cares for you so deeply and that you’re comfortable being around them even though you’ve only met last week. yknow? this app is my twin flame.</td>\n",

So far, I have used the app in the morning and evening. I wanted to be able to track my mood to get a good sense of what really bothers me and be able to journal. I find that it really helps me find peace and be able to find happy moments in my day when it is hard to find sometimes. I love being able to find ways to be grateful and this really helps me find those moments in the day when you’ve been so stressed and all you can think of is the negative parts and then turning it around to find those moments that stand out that are positive. Even during times of stress I have been able to see the positive. I’ve been able to take a step back and really look at each situation as a learning experience and sometimes it is hard to do when you are battling depression, anxiety and PTSD.

While using stoicism as a framework, this app has really been a way for me to practice personal reflection and awareness, cultivating better emotional wellness. Easily accessible techniques for gratitude, journaling, meditation, and breathing exercises without the pressure of any one thing being a requirement. The app guides you to those tools through a pleasant sequence without any pressure to use specific techniques. It’s so gentle. If you want to journal, then journal. If you want to meditate, then do that. And if you don’t, that’s ok too. It’s totally up to you. I find tremendous value in the simple act of making these sequences a part of my daily morning and evening routine; from simply opening the app and assessing how I feel to what my priority for the day is to how productive I felt. The app now even guides personal reflection towards specific categories. If in the morning I say I’m going to focus on reading, in the evening the app will then guide me to reflect on recalling what I read that day. So simple, but so helpful. Excellent user experience, an essential part of my every day routine now.   \n",

I’ve only started using this app a few days ago and OMG😳 This app is so beautiful. I’m only writing a review just so I can ask if you guys can put a password for the journal part because my mom looks through my phone and I don’t want her to read the things I write in there💀 Anyways, I do actually really love this app and its perfect from the bottom of those codes and to the top of the icon. It’s iconic honestly. Not to forget the fact that it’s been lifting burdens and weights off of my back when I type everything in details. It’s like a friend that I’ve always wanted, which is sad because none of my real (alive) friends are there for me and asks me how I am like how stoic is🥲 Ever since the app asked me the first question, I’ve poured allllll of the things I wanted to say and in details too. I- this app is like that one friend that you have that’s always there for you no matter what and genuinely cares for you so deeply and that you’re comfortable being around them even though you’ve only met last week. yknow? this app is my twin flame.   \n",

I wasn’t sure if I wanted to buy a membership but I did because I wanted to have full access to the entire app to be able to really see if it was worth it. So far, I have used the app in the morning and evening. I wanted to be able to track my mood to get a good sense of what really bothers me and be able to journal. I find that it really helps me find peace and be able to find happy moments in my day when it is hard to find sometimes. I love being able to find ways to be grateful and this really helps me find those moments in the day when you’ve been so stressed and all you can think of is the negative parts and then turning it around to find those moments that stand out that are positive. Even during times of stress I have been able to see the positive. I’ve been able to take a step back and really look at each situation as a learning experience and sometimes it is hard to do when you are battling depression, anxiety and PTSD. Definitely recommend this app!!   \n",

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.</td>\n",

Now I’m downright concerned of the impact this app could have on a fragile or traumatized person.\\n\\nI recently and unexpectedly was domestically assaulted. As I have been, I logged it in Youper. I told the app I was depressed because I was assaulted by someone I previously trusted. \\n\\nThe app told me: “Is it possible that, sometimes, when confronted with personal failings you forget to be kind to yourself”\\n\\nI’m sorry but I can’t support an app that goes from a person talking about a personal assault to suggesting personal failings. Now I’d like to know what it would tell me if I’d been raped instead of assaulted. \\n\\nPlease, only use this app as a journal for when life ain’t too bad. The more the severe the situation, the more inappropriate this app is. Personally, I always have professional help as well. I’d be very worried about anyone who didn’t have professional support using this app for anything at all when it matters most.\\n\\nThanks devs for being responsive to my last review. I appreciate it. You need to find a way to improve this app before you hurt someone if you haven’t already.\\n\\nPrevious review:\\n\\nForced and Frustrating\\n\\nIt’s a well made app. But it forces you to say you like things or agree with things even if you don’t. Forcing lies isn’t great if you’re trying to be honest about your mental state and tracking it. It ends up feeling like cheap manipulation rather than help. \\n\\nThis amounts to a lot of frustration if you’re trying to use the app honestly. In some of my more difficult moments the app’s canned nudging “guidance” just made me feel worse and angrier for all its irrelevance and lacking representation.\\n\\nNow it’s promoting certain doctors and asking for donations. Made me offer to donate or ask for more information about donating when I wanted to wrap up my entry. I had to quit the app to get around it. \\n\\nAll in all would be a good app if it wasn’t so forced. The tests are good for tracking progress and reactions to life events. The word associations between feelings and parts of life are really good. \\n\\nThis app is of good quality but needs a lot of thoughtful work on improving it.</td>\n",

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.   \n",

I like the app so far I really do but it is telling me that it’s still Thursday(yesterday) but today is Friday. It might be because I didn’t do my “evening routine but I did it today and still wouldn’t let me go to the next day. I’m confused and don’t know what to do, I tried deleting and re-downloading it but it didn’t work other than just giving me the same day and have to redo it over again. Someone help me please.\\nEdit: Never mind I got it to fix itself after quite a bit of time. I do really like the app so far after one day of use but yeah. But also thank you for the response that makes it much easier for me and now it’ll always be on the right day.   \n",

In the event other incorrectly associate this site with anything related to Ryan Holiday, as I did, they are not connected. \\n\\nOne app bug I do wonder about is why the daily count randomly restarts at one. Also, thought it might be cool if there was a way to print the journals (perhaps even commercially or bound- all or as a selection). Perhaps you can and I’m just not great with tech. Anyway…. Thank you for the email and I am sorry for the incorrect association.   \n",

The recommendations have gotten better and more personal. I use this app all the time. \\n\\nI love this app. But half the time I go to use it and it never loads. Seems kind of backwards. If it loaded and opened when I needed it it would have 5 stars.   \n",

I get that they need the money, but I don’t have the money to pay for it. It was nice to be able to at least track my mood. Now I’m sad. Update: the mood tracker came back but now it’s gone again and I can’t find it. I hate it when they change things so much, you can’t find anything and it just makes my stress… Update again: I found the mood tracker and it’s LOCKED. Now I can’t do ANYTHING without paying money…   \n",

       "28854  Updated review:\\nI had a concerned previous review, I still recommend you read it. Now I’m downright concerned of the impact this app could have on a fragile or traumatized person.\\n\\nI recently and unexpectedly was domestically assaulted. As I have been, I logged it in Youper. I told the app I was depressed because I was assaulted by someone I previously trusted. \\n\\nThe app told me: “Is it possible that, sometimes, when confronted with personal failings you forget to be kind to yourself”\\n\\nI’m sorry but I can’t support an app that goes from a person talking about a personal assault to suggesting personal failings. Now I’d like to know what it would tell me if I’d been raped instead of assaulted. \\n\\nPlease, only use this app as a journal for when life ain’t too bad. The more the severe the situation, the more inappropriate this app is. Personally, I always have professional help as well. I’d be very worried about anyone who didn’t have professional support using this app for anything at all when it matters most.\\n\\nThanks devs for being responsive to my last review. I appreciate it. You need to find a way to improve this app before you hurt someone if you haven’t already.\\n\\nPrevious review:\\n\\nForced and Frustrating\\n\\nIt’s a well made app. But it forces you to say you like things or agree with things even if you don’t. Forcing lies isn’t great if you’re trying to be honest about your mental state and tracking it. It ends up feeling like cheap manipulation rather than help. \\n\\nThis amounts to a lot of frustration if you’re trying to use the app honestly. In some of my more difficult moments the app’s canned nudging “guidance” just made me feel worse and angrier for all its irrelevance and lacking representation.\\n\\nNow it’s promoting certain doctors and asking for donations. Made me offer to donate or ask for more information about donating when I wanted to wrap up my entry. I had to quit the app to get around it. \\n\\nAll in all would be a good app if it wasn’t so forced. The tests are good for tracking progress and reactions to life events. The word associations between feelings and parts of life are really good. \\n\\nThis app is of good quality but needs a lot of thoughtful work on improving it.   \n",

It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones.

       "9      Absolutely incredible. The focus breathing, the journaling, and the adaptability to each user. I have never seen such an app before. I have downloaded over 20 journaling apps, but I eventually always delete the app because I forget to journal because the app doesn’t help me. Now, this journaling app is incredible. I write 3-5 times a day and use its focus breathing exercises so much. This is the only app I want to actually support with money even though I am a stingy person.\\n\\n——\\n\\nUpdate: I do dislike the new feature where it asks you to think negatively to become grateful without being able to decline like last update. For those who are suffering depression, anxiety, and other mental issues, this is a big black hole that one can go into. I plead the developers to lock this feature away by being able to decline before the app asks you that question.   \n",
       "11                                      I’ve written a couple app reviews for this app before, but I just want to put in that after using it for about three months now, I must say that stoic is quite a wonderful app! It gives you all sorts of options for things to do that really help my everyday mentality, like breathing excersize, meditations, and fear settings/thought excersize. A high recommend! I’d say my only issue with this app is probably that the morning routines are SO long. Honestly I don’t mind doing them, but I just wish there were options to choose the amount of questions asked. People are busy, not everyone has 30 minutes each morning to answer like 10 questions. Perhaps five or six? Also I like the meditation options they have, I only wish they had a few guided ones. That’s only a request, not a complaint though! My first point was a complaint.   \n",

I like the app so far I really do but it is telling me that it’s still Thursday(yesterday) but today is Friday. It might be because I didn’t do my “evening routine but I did it today and still wouldn’t let me go to the next day. I’m confused and don’t know what to do, I tried deleting and re-downloading it but it didn’t work other than just giving me the same day and have to redo it over again. Someone help me please.\\nEdit: Never mind I got it to fix itself after quite a bit of time. I do really like the app so far after one day of use but yeah. But also thank you for the response that makes it much easier for me and now it’ll always be on the right day.   \n",

Unfortunately there is no free version (despite setup telling you that you can unlock all the features - implying an unlocked subset). You can get a seven day trial which automatically converts to withdrawing funds from your account. \\n\\nI have a brain injury that causes me not to function well, and I’ve learned not to allow these (through trial and mostly error) as I will forget about the app, forget when I downloaded it if I do remember, and/or forget to cancel if I’m not getting value. Therefore, I have no way to evaluate the app, even though it may be beneficial for me....\\n\\nAdditionally, the subscription model, while a great way to fund continued development, is extremely limiting for those of us with limited income due to disability.   \n",

It provided a variety of options to cope with my emotions on a day to day basis and I loved the different journal templates to start a journaling session and the way it would use stoicism & thinking trap meditations to help me through especially rough days. However, there must’ve been an update because I no longer have access to the wide range of journal prompts and the ones I do have layer on top of one another instead of allowing for a “at your own pace” kind of app. I’m not sure if I’m ready to abandon ship yet, but I definitely am not getting out of it what I used to.   \n",
